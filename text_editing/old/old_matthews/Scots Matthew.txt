The Forebears and Nativitie oʼ Christ.
1The buik oʼ the generation oʼ Jesus the Christ, Dauvidʼs son, the son oʼ Abʼram.
2Abʼram begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jaucob; and Jaucob begat Judah and his brethren.
3And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah oʼ Tamar; and Pharez begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram.
4And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon.
5And Salmon begat Boaz, oʼ Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed, oʼ Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
6And Jesse begat Dauvid the king; and Dauvid the king begat Solomon, oʼ her wha was Uriahʼs.
7And Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa.
8And Asa begat Jehosaphat; and Jehosaphat begat Jehoram; and Jehoram begat Uzziah.
9And Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
10And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah.
11And Josiah begat Jehoiachin and his brethren, nar‐haun the time they war carryʼt awaʼ to Babylon.
12And eftir they cam to Babylon, Jehoiachin begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zerubbabel.
13And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor.
14And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud.
15And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jaucob.
16And Jaucob begat Joseph, Maryʼs husband, oʼ wham was born Jesus, wha is caʼd “The Christ.”
17Sae aʼ the generations frae Abʼram to Dauvid are fowrteen generations; and frae Dauvid to the takin awaʼ to Babylon fowrteen generations; and frae the takin awaʼ to Babylon to Christ fowrteen generations.
18Noo the nativitie oʼ Jesus Christ was thisgate: whan his mither Mary was mairryʼt till Joseph, ʼor they cam thegither, she was fund wiʼ bairn oʼ the Holie Spirit.
19Than her guidman, Joseph, bein an upricht man, and no desirin her name soud be iʼthe mooth oʼ the public, was ettlin to pit her awaʼ hidlins.
20But as he had thir things in his mind, see! an Angel oʼ the Lord appearit till him by a dream, sayin, “Joseph, son oʼ Dauvid, binna feared to tak till ye yere wife, Mary; for that whilk is begotten in her is by the Holie Spirit.
21“And she sal bring forth a son, and ye shall caʼ his name JESUS; for he sal save his folk frae their sins.”
22Noo, aʼ this was dune, that it might come to pass what was said by the Lord throwe the prophet,
23“Tak tent! a maiden sal be wiʼ bairn, and sal bring forth a son; and they wull caʼ his name Emmanuel,” whilk is, translatit, “God wiʼ us.”
24Sae Joseph, comin oot oʼ his sleep, did as the Angel had bidden him, and took till him his wife.
25And leevʼd in continence wiʼ her till she had brocht forth her first‐born son; and caʼd his name JESUS.

The Wyss Men frae the East. To Egypt, and back again.
1Noo, whan Jesus was born iʼ Bethlehem‐Judah, iʼ the days oʼ King Herod, lo! Wyss Men cam frae the East tae Jerusalem.
2And quoʼ they, “Whaur is he bidin that is caʼd King oʼ the Jews? for iʼ the East we saw his starn, and are come forrit to worship him.”
3But the King, hearin, was sair putten‐about; and aʼ Jerusalem wiʼ him.
4And, gatherin aʼ the heigh‐priests and writers oʼ the nation, he wad ken oʼ them “whaur the Messiah soud be born?”
5And quoʼ they, “In Bethlehem‐Judah; for sae it is putten doon by the prophet:
6“ ‘And thou, Bethlehem, land oʼ Judah, nane the least amang Judahʼs princes! for oot oʼ thee sal come a Ruler, wha sal tend my folk oʼ Israʼl!’ ”
7Than, Herod, convenin the Wyss Men privately, faund oot mair strickly oʼ the comin oʼ the starn;
8And bad them gang to Bethlehem; and quoʼ he, “Gang, and seek ye oot the wee bairn; and whan ye ken, fesh me word again, that I as weel may come and worship.”
9Eftir hearin the King, they gaed awaʼ; and lo! the starn whilk they saw iʼ the East gaed on afore them, till it stood whaur the wee bairn was.
10And whan they saw the starn, they were blythe wiʼ unco blytheness.
11And comin intil the hoose, they saw the wee bairn, and his mither Mary; and loutin doon, worshippʼt him. And openinʼ oot their gear, they offerʼt till him gifts — gowd, and frankincense, and myrrh.
12And bein warned in a dream no to go back till Herod, they airtit their way to their ain kintra anither gate.
13Noo whan they had gane, tak tent! an Angel oʼ the Lord appearʼt to Joseph by a dream, and quoʼ he, “Rise, tak till ye the wee bairn, and his mither, and flee intil Egypt, and bide ye thar till I tell ye; for Herod seeks the wee bairn to destroy him.”
14And he, risin, took the wee bairn and his mither by nicht, and cam intil Egypt.
15And bade there till Herodʼs death: that it soud be fulfilled what was said by the Lord throwe the prophet, “Frae Egypt hae I caʼd my Son.”
16Than Herod, seein he was made sport oʼ by the Wyss Men, was unco furious, and sent oot to slay aʼ the lad‐bairns in Bethlehem, and aʼ the kintra‐side aboot, frae twa‐year auld doon: conform tae the time he had been tellʼt by the Wyss Men.
17Than cam to pass the sayin oʼ Jeremiah the prophet:
18“A voice was heard in Ramah, greetin and maenin, and murnin sair; Raʼhel greetin for her weans, and wadna be comfortit, for that they are‐na!”
19But Herod deein, look! an Angel oʼ the Lord by dream appears to Joseph in Egypt.
20And quoʼ he, “Rise! tak the wee bairn and his mither, and journey intil Israʼlʼs land; for they that socht the wee bairnʼs life are deid.”
21And he raise, and took till him the wee bairn and his mither, and cam intil the land oʼ Israʼl.
22But whan it was tellʼt him that Archelaus rang in Judea in the stead oʼ Herod his faither, he was fleyʼt to gang thar: but, being instruckit in a dream, he gaed intil the pairts oʼ Galilee:
23And cam and dwalt in a citie caʼd Nazareth; that it soud come to pass that was said by the prophet, “He will be caʼd a Nazarene.”

CHAPTIR THRIE.
John bapteezin. He speaks wiʼ unco plainness to the folk. Bapteezes the Son of Man.
1Noo, iʼ thae days, comes John the Baptist, preachinʼ iʼ the muirlands oʼ Judea.
2And quoʼ he, “Repent ye aʼ! for the kingdom oʼ Heeven is at haun!”
3For it is he wha was tellʼt oʼ by Esaiah the prophet, sayin, “The sough oʼ ane crying oot iʼ the waste, ‘Mak ye ready a gate for the Lord! Strauchten oot his fitpath!’ ”
4And John his sel had his cleedin oʼ camelʼs hair, and a belt oʼ a skin; and his meat was locusts and rock hinny.
5And thar war gangin oot till him Jerusalem and aʼ Judah, and the kintra‐side aboot Jordan;
6And war bapteezʼt by him in Jordan; confessin aʼ their sin.
7But whan he saw a hantle oʼ the Pharisees and Sadducees come till his bapteezin, quoʼ he to them, “Eh, ye venomous race! Wha has gien ye warninʼ to flee frae comin wrath?
8“Fesh than forth the frutes conform till repentance!
9“And say‐ye‐na to yersels, ‘We hae Abraʼm till oor faither!’ for say I tʼye, God coud raise up oot oʼ thir stanes, bairns to Abraʼm!
10“And noo is the aixe brocht to the rute oʼ the trees; and ilka tree bringin na forth gude frute is cuttit doon, and cuisten intil the burnin.
11“I, indeed, div in watir bapteeze ye intil repentance; but he wha follows me is sterker nor mysel; whase shoon Iʼse no fit to cairry; he sal bapteeze ye wiʼ Holie Spirit, and flaughts oʼ fire.
12“Whase fanner is in his neive, and heʼse scour‐oot his threshin‐flair, and gaither his wheat intil his girnal; but the cauff wull he burn in nevir‐endin lowe!”
13Than cam Jesus frae Galilee tae John, to be bapteezʼt oʼ him.
14Noo, John wad hae forbidden him; and quoʼ he, “I hae need oʼ thy bapteezin, and come ye to me?”
15But Jesus answerʼt him, and said, “Sae be it e noo; for sae it behoves us to fulfil aʼ richt‐gangin!” Than he contentit him.
16And Jesus, whan he was bapteezʼt, gaed up straucht frae the watir, and lo! the heevens war unsteekit till him, and he saw the Spirit oʼ God comin doon like a doo, and lichtin upon him.
17And tak tent! a voice oot oʼ the lift, sayin, “This is my Son, my Beloved, in wham I delicht!”

Sautan has a tulzie wiʼ Christ. Jesus taks up wiʼ Capernaum; and bids a wheen disciples.
1Than was Jesus airtit by the Spirit intil the wilderness, thar to be testit oʼ the Enemy.
2And whan he had fastit for forty days and nichts, he was spent wiʼ hunger.
3And whan the Tempter cam till him, quoʼ he, “Gin thou be Godʼs Son, speak to thir stanes, that they be bannocks!”
4But he, answerin till him, said, “No allenarlie on breid leeves man, but by ilk word oʼ Godʼs mooth!”
5Than the deevil taks him wiʼ him intil the holie citie, and pits him on the tapmaist towerickie oʼ the Temple.
6And quoʼ he till him, “Gin ye be Godʼs Son, cast yersel ower; for it is putten‐doon, ‘Till his Angels sal he gie chairge anent ye; and on their hauns sal they haud ye up, that ye clour‐na yere fit again a stane!’ ”
7Quoʼ Jesus till him, “Ance mair it is putten‐doon, ‘Ye sanna temp the Lord yere God!’ ”
8And again the Enemy taks him up intil an unco heigh mountain, and airts him till aʼ the kingdoms oʼ the yirth, and aʼ their glorie;
9And says till him, “Aʼ thae things gie I tʼye gin ye, faʼin doon, gie worship to me!”
10Than quoʼ Jesus till him, “Awa, Sautan! for it is putten‐doon, ‘The Lord yere God sal ye worship; and him alane sal ye serʼ!’ ”
11Than the deevil quats him; and lo! the Angels cam to serʼ him.
12Noo whan it was tellʼt him that John was taen haud oʼ, he gaed awaʼ intil Galilee:
13And forsakin Nazareth, he cam and made his dwallin iʼ Capernaum, on the side oʼ the Loch, on the border oʼ Zabulon and Naphtali;
14That it micht come to pass what said Esaiah the Prophet,
15“Land oʼ Zabulon! and land oʼ Naphtali! Galilee oʼ the nations!
16“The folk that were sittin iʼ the mirk, saw an unco licht; and till aʼ thae sittin iʼ the land and the mirkness oʼ the deid, the licht raise up!”
17Frae that time forth begude Jesus to preach; and quoʼ he, “Repent ye! for Heevenʼs kingdom draws nar‐haun!”
18And walkin by the Loch oʼ Galilee, he saw twa brithers, Simon, (caʼd Peter), and Andro his brither, castin aboot a net iʼ the Loch, for they war fisher‐folk.
19And quoʼ he to them, “Follow ye me! and Iʼse mak ye fishers oʼ men!”
20And they, withoot ado, left the nets, and gaed eftir him.
21And gangin forrit tharawa, he saw ither twa brithers, James, son oʼ Zebedee, and his brither John, in a smack wiʼ Zebedee their faither, workin on their nets: and he bad them “Come!”
22And they, forsakin the boat, and their faither, gaed eftir him.
23And Jesus gaed ower aʼ Galilee, instructin iʼ their kirks, and giean forth the Blythe‐Message oʼ the Kingdom, and healin aʼ diseases, and aʼ infirmities amang the folk.
24And the sough oʼ him gaed oot intil aʼ Syria: and they feshʼt till him aʼ wha war ill wiʼ aʼ diseases and pains, and thae possessʼt wiʼ demons, and dementit, and that had a stroke: and he healed them.
25And unco thrangs followʼt him — frae Galilee, and the Ten Cities, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and ayont the Jordan.

Whaʼs happy? A wheen auld sayins strauchtit oot. Ettle ye perfection?
1And, seein the thrang oʼ folk, he gaed up intil a mountain; and whan he was sutten‐doon, his disciples gatherʼt aboot.
2And he openʼt his mooth, and instructit them; and quoʼ he:
3“Happy the spirits that are lown and cannie: for the kingdom oʼ Heeven is waitin for them!
4“Happy they wha are makin their maen; for they sal finʼ comfort and peace.
5“Happy the lowly and meek oʼ the yirth: for the yirth sal be their ain haddin.
6“Happy they whase hunger and drouth are aʼ for holiness: for they sal be satisfyʼt!
7“Happy the pitfuʼ: for they sal win pitie theirsels!
8“Happy the pure‐heartit: for their een sal dwal upon God!
9“Happy the makkers‐up oʼ strife: for they sal be coontit for bairns oʼ God!
10“Happy the ill‐treatit anes for the sake oʼ gude: for theyʼse hae the kingdom oʼ God!
11“Happy sal ye be when folk sal miscaʼ ye, and ill‐treat ye, and say aʼ things again ye wrangouslie for my sake!
12“Joy ye, and be blythe! for yere meed is great in Heeven! for eʼen sae did they to the prophets afore ye!
13“The saut oʼ the yirth are ye: but gin the saut hae tint its tang, hooʼs it to be sautit? Is it no clean useless? to be cuisten oot, and trauchlʼt under folkʼs feet.
14“Ye are the warldʼs licht. A toon biggit on a hill‐tap is aye seen.
15“Nor wad men licht a crusie, and pit it neath a cog, but set it up; and it gies licht to aʼ the hoose.
16“Sae lat yere licht gang abreid amang men; that seein yere gude warks they may gie God glorie.
17“Think‐na I am come to do awaʼ wiʼ the Law, or the Prophets: Iʼse no come to do awaʼ, but to bring to pass!
18“For truly say I tʼye, Till Heeven and Yirth dwine awaʼ, ae jot or ae tittle fails‐na oʼ aʼ the Law, till aʼ comes to pass!
19“Than, wha breaks ane oʼ thae weeʼst commauns, and gars ithers sae do, he sal be caʼd sma iʼ the kingdom oʼ Heeven: but wha sal keep them, and spread them abreid, he sal be caʼd great iʼ the kingdom oʼ Heeven.
20“For I say till ye, Gin yere gudeness gang‐na yont the Scribes and Pharisees, neʼer sal ye win intil the kingdom oʼ Heeven!
21“Ye ken hoo it was spoken till the folk oʼ auld: ‘Ye maunna kill; and whasae kills is in danger oʼ the Coort.’
22“But say I tʼye, Whasae is angry wiʼ his brither‐man, sal be in danger oʼ the Coort: and wha sal say to his brither‐man, ‘Gonyel!’ sal be in danger oʼ the Cooncil: but wha sal say ‘Fule!’ sal be in danger oʼ the fire oʼ hell!
23“Sae, gin ye fesh yere offerin to the altar‐place, and thar bethink ye oʼ a sairness in a britherʼs mind anent ye,
24“Pit doon yere gift fornent the offerin‐stane, and haud awa; first, be at ane wiʼ yere brither‐man, and syne come and offer yere gift!
25“Mak up wiʼ yere enemy while ye are yet in the highway wiʼ him; sae as he gies‐ye‐na ower to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and ye be cuisten intil prison.
26“Truly say I tʼye, Ye come‐na oot, till ye ha paid the last bodle!
27“Ye hae heard it was said lang syne, ‘Ye sanna commit adultery!’
28“But say I tʼye, Whasae sets his een on a wumman wiʼ desire, has eʼen e‐noo committit the sin wiʼ her in his heart!
29“And gin yere richt ee ensnare ye, oot wʼit, and cast it frae ye! it is for yere gude that ae member soud be destroyʼt, and no that yere hail body soud faʼ intil hell!
30“And gin yere richt haun ensnare ye, cut it aff, and cast it awa! better for ye that ae member soud fail, and no that yere hail body soud faʼ intil hell!
31“The sayin has been, ‘Whasae pits awa his wife, lat him gie her a written divorcement!’
32“But say I, Whasae pits awa his wife, let abee for the cause oʼ adultery, gars her commit adultery; and whasae weds her that is putten awa commits adultery.
33“Ance mair, ye ken it has been said by them oʼ by‐past time, ‘Ye sanna mansweer yersel, but yeʼse render to the Lord yere aiths!’
34“But say I, Sweer‐na ava! no by Heeven, for it is Godʼs thron:
35“Nor yet by the Yirth, for it is his fit‐brod: nor Jerusalem, for it is the citie oʼ the Great King.
36“Nor sal ye sweer by yere ain heid for ye canna mak ae hair white nor black.
37“But lat yere answer be, ‘Aye, aye,’ and ‘Na, na!’ for onything mair comes oʼ nae gude.
38“Ye ken it has been said, ‘An ee for an ee, and a tooth for a tooth!’
39“But say I, Resist‐ye na ill; but gin ane clour ye on the ae cheek, turn ye till him the ither as weel.
40“And gin ony man hae a law‐plea wiʼ ye, and tak awa yere coat, eʼen lat him hae the cloak as weel.
41“And gin ye be impressʼd for a mile wiʼ ane, gang ane mair wiʼ him.
42“Gie till him seekin frae ye; and frae him wha wad receive oʼ ye turn‐ye‐no awa.
43“Ye ken it has been said, ‘Ye sal loʼe yere neebor, and hate yere fae.’
44“But say I, Loʼe yere faes; bless the anes that ban and curse ye; seek the gude oʼ thae that hate ye; and pray for sic as shamefully ill‐treat ye, and seek for yere wrang:
45“That ye aʼ may be bairns oʼ yere Faither in Heeven; for he gars his sun to glint alike on the ill and on the gude; and sends oot his rain baith on the just and the unjust.
46“For gin ye but loʼe whaur thar is love till yersel, whaur is yere meed? divna eʼen the reivin tax‐men do the same?
47“And gin ye but speir eftir yere ain kith, how div ye mair nor ither folk? divna eʼen the tax‐men sae?

7“And in yere prayin, rhyme‐na things ower and ower, incontinent, like the heathen‐folk: for they trow gin that they speak eneuch, they sal be heard.

Intil Capernaum, whaur he drave out sickness. Oot on the Loch, whaur the storm was hauden in his neive!
1And whan he cam doon frae the mountain, great thrangs oʼ folk followʼt him.
2And lo! a leper cam and worshippʼt him, and said, “Lord! gin ye wad, ye coud mak me clean!”
3And Jesus pat oot his haun, and touched him, sayin, “I wull, be ye clean!” And at aince his leprosie was healed.
4And Jesus chairged him, “See that ye tell nane; but gang yere ways till the priest, and gie ye the gift commandit by Moses, for a token to them!”
5And whan Jesus cam intil Capernaum, thar cam till him a Captain, and besocht him,
6Sayin, “Lord! my servant‐lad is doon wiʼ a stroke, in my hoose, in unco pain!”
7Quoʼ Jesus till him, “I wull come and heal him!”
8And the Captain answerʼt, “Lord! I am‐na fit ye soud come aneath my roof; but only say the word, and my servant‐lad sal be weel!
9“For eʼen I my sel, a man aneath authoritie, hae sodgers under me; and I say till ane ‘Gang,’ and he gangs; and till another ‘Come,’ and he comes; and till my servant‐lad, ‘Do sae and sae,’ and he dis it!”
10Hearin this, Jesus ferlied; and said to them that followʼt, “I haena fund sic faith as this, no in aʼ Israʼl!
11“And I say tʼye, Mony sal come frae the East and frae the Wast, and sit doon wiʼ Abraʼm, and Isaac, and Jaucob, iʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven,
12“But the sons oʼ the kingdom sal be cuisten oot intil the mirk oot‐by: thar sal be greetin and cherkin oʼ teeth!”
13And Jesus said to the Captain, “Gang yere ways! Eʼen as ye lippened, sae sal it be dune tʼye.” And his servant‐lad was made weel iʼ that same ʼoor.
14And Jesus, enterin Peterʼs hoose, saw his gude‐mither lyin, doon wiʼ a fivver.
15And he touched her haun, and the fivver was gane. And she raise, and waitit on him.
16But whan the gloamin cam on, they brocht till him a hantle wiʼ evil spirits, and he cuist oot the spirits wiʼ a word, and healed aʼ the sick:
17That sae micht the words oʼ Esaiah be fulfilled, wha threepit, “He his ain sel took oor sillinesses, and bure oor sicknesses!”
18Noo Jesus, seein great thrangs aboot him, commandit to gang ower to the ither side.
19And a certain Writer cam, and quoʼ he, “Maister! I wull follow ye, whaursaeʼer ye may gang!”
20Jesus said till him, “The tods hae holes, and the birdies oʼ the lift hae nests; but the Son oʼ Man hasna whaur his heid may lie!”
21And anither oʼ his followers says, “Lord! lat me first gang till my faitherʼs burial!”
22But Jesus says till him, “Follow ye me! and lea the deid to bury their ain deid!”
23And whaun he gaed intil a boat his disciples followʼt him.
24And see! a great storm raise on the Loch; and wave efteir wave gaed ower the boat: but he was sleepin.
25And comin till him, they roused him, sayin, “Maister! save us: we perish!”
26And he says to them, “Why soud ye be fleyʼt? ye oʼ sic smaʼ faith!” Than he raise, and challenged the winds and the sea. And aʼ was lown!
27And the men ferlied uncolie, sayin, “Whatna man is this, that eʼen the winds and the watirs obey him?”
28And whan he cam to the ither side, to the pairts oʼ the Gadarenes, thar met him twa possessʼt anes, comin oot oʼ the tombs, unco fierce, sae that nane daur gang that gate.
29And see! they cryʼt oot, “What hae we wiʼ you, Son oʼ God! Are ye come to torment us ʼor the time?”
30Noo thar war feedin, a gey bit aff frae them, a great herd oʼ swine.
31Sae the evil spirits besocht him, sayin, “Gin ye cast us oot, send us intil the herd oʼ swine!”
32And he said to them, “Gang!” And whan they cam oot, they gied intil the herd oʼ swine; and lo! aʼ the herd rushed doon the scaur intil the Loch, and perished iʼ the watirs.
33And they that herdit them fled and gaed their gate to the citie, and tellʼt aʼ; and what had befaun the possessʼt anes.

Twa hames made blythe — Matthew and Jairus. The blinʼ and the dumb rejoice.
1And he enterʼt the boat, and gaed ower, and cam till his ain toun.
2And behauld! they war bringin till him a man doon wiʼ a stroke, lyin on a couch: and Jesus, seein their aefauldness says tae the man, “Bairn, be oʼ gude heart; yere sins are forgien ye!”
3And mark! thar war Writers sayin within theirsels, “This ane speaks profaneness!”
4And Jesus, kennin their thochts, says, “Why soud ye think ill in yere hearts?
5“Whilk is easier to say, ‘Yere sins are forgien!’ or to say, ‘Rise ye, and walk?’
6“But sae as ye may ken the Son oʼ Man has authoritie on the yirth to forgie sins, (quoʼ he till the ane wiʼ a stroke,) Rise ye, tak up yere bed, and gang yere ways till yere ain hoose!”
7And he, risin up, gaed awa till his ain hoose.
8And aʼ the folk, seein it war dauntit wiʼ fear, and glorifyʼt God for gien sic pooer to men!
9And as Jesus gaed on frae that, he saw a man caʼd Matthew, sittin whaur the dues were paid; and he says till him, “Follow ye me!” And he raise, and followʼt him.
10And it cam aboot, as he was at meat iʼ the hoose, that behauld! mony tax‐men and ill‐deedie anes cam and sat doon wiʼ him and his disciples.
11And whan the Pharisees saw that, quoʼ they till his disciples, “Hoo isʼt that yere maister taks meat wiʼ tax‐folk and ill‐deedie anes?”
12Noo Jesus heard; and quoʼ he to them, “Itʼs no the hale anes that need the leech, but thae that are ill.
13“But gang ye and learn what that sets forth, ‘I wad suner hae mercie nor sacrifeece; for I am‐na come to caʼ the richtous, but sinners.”
14Than the disciples oʼ John cam till him; and quoʼ they, “Hoo isʼt that we fast muckle — and the Pharisees — but yere disciples haena to fast?”
15And Jesus says to them, “Can the bairns oʼ the bridal‐bower fast whan the bridegroom is wiʼ them? But the days come, whan the bridegroom is taen awa frae them, and than wull they fast!
16“And nae ane pits a clout oʼ new claith on an auld coat, for in waukin‐up it rives awa frae the cleedin, and the hole is made waur.
17“Nor div men pit new wine intil auld skins; else the skins rive, and the wine skails; and the skins are destroyʼt: but they pit new wine intil new wine‐skins, and baith are keepit.”
18And, meanwhile he was speakin thir things till them, behauld! a certain Ruler cam, and loutit doon afore him, sayin, “My dochter maun eʼen noo be deid! But come and pit thy haun ower her, and she sal leeve!”
19And Jesus raise and followʼt him; and the disciples as weel.
20And behauld! a wumman wiʼ an issue oʼ blude twal year, cam ahint him to touch the border oʼ his mantle.
21For she said till hersel, “Gin I can but touch his mantle, I sal be weel!”
22But Jesus turned him roonʼ, and whan he saw her, said, “Dochter, tak heart! Yere faith has made ye hale!” And the wumman was made hale frae that ʼoor.
23And Jesus, comin intil the Rulerʼs hoose, saw the flute‐players, and the folk makin a rowt.
24He said to them, “Gie place: for the bairn is no deid, but is sleepin!” And they geckʼt at him, and leuch.
25But whan aʼ the folk war putten oot, he gaed ben; and takin her by the haun, the lassie raise.
26And the sough oʼt spread abreid in aʼ that kintra‐side.
27And as Jesus gaed forrit, twa blinʼ men followʼt him, cryinʼ oot and sayin, “Son oʼ Dauvid! hae mercie on us!”
28And whan he was within the hoose, the blinʼ men cam till him; and Jesus says to them, “Lippen ye that I can do this?” And they say till him, “Aye, Lord!”
29Than touched he their een, sayin, “Eʼen as yere faith, sae be it dune till ye!”
30And their een war unsteekit; and Jesus stricklie chairged them, sayin, “See that nae man ken!”
31But they gaed oot, and spread abreid his fame in aʼ that kintra‐side.
32And as they gaed oot, behauld! they brocht him a dumb man, wiʼ an evil spirit.
33And whan the evil spirit was cuisten oot, the dumb spak; and aʼ the folk ferlied, sayin, “Nevir was sic seen in Israʼl!”
34But the Pharisees said, “He casts oot the demons by the prince oʼ the demons!”
35And Jesus gaed aboot aʼ the touns and villages, teachin iʼ their kirks, and makin kent the Blythe‐message oʼ the Kingdom, and healin aʼ kinds oʼ sickness, and every ill amang aʼ the folk.
36But whan he lookit on the thrangs, he was fuʼ oʼ compassion, for they war in distress and war scattered, as sheep wantin a shepherd.
37Than said he till his disciples “The hairst is maist abundant, but the hairst‐folk are few!
38“Pray ye to the Maister oʼ the hairst, that he may send oot laborers intil his hairst!”

The twal Apostles coonsellʼt, and sent out.
1And caʼin his twal disciples till him, he gied them the rule ower unclean spirits, sae as to cast them oot, and to heal aʼ mainner oʼ sickness and fecklessness.
2Noo the twal Apostlesʼ names are thir: first Simon, wha is named Peter, and Andro his brither; James oʼ Zebedee, and John his brither;
3Philip, and Bartholomie, Tammas, and Matthew the tax man; James oʼ Alpheus, and Thaddeus;
4Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, wha eʼen betrayʼt him.
5Thir twal Jesus sent oot, and chairged them, sayin, “Gang‐na the gate oʼ the Gentiles, and enter‐na ony Samaritan citie;
6“But gang ye raither to the forwanderin sheep oʼ Israʼlʼs hoose.
7“And as ye gang, proclaim and say, ‘The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is at haun!’
8“The sick heal; the lepers cleanse; the deid raise; ill spirits cast ye oot: freely ye hae gotten; as freely gie!
9“Get ye nae gowd, nor siller, nor yet copper iʼ yer pouches;
10“Nae pock for yer journey, nor a spare coat, nor shoon, nor staff: for the worker is wordie oʼ his meat!
11“And intil whatna citie or toun ye may gae, seek ye oot wha is wordie; and bide ye thar till ye gang awa.
12“And whan ye come intil a hoose, salute it.
13“And gin the hoose be wordie, lat yere peace bide upon it; and gin it be no wordie, yere peace wull come back till ye again.
14“And whasae winna tak ye in, nor hear yere words — whan ye gang oot oʼ that hoose or that toun, flaff aff the vera stour frae yere feet.
15“Truly say I tʼye, It sal be mair tholeable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day oʼ judgment nor for that citie!
16“And look! I send ye oot as sheep amang wolves: be ye than wyss like serpents, and aefauld as doos.
17“But tak tent oʼ men! for they wull gie ye up to Cooncils, and clour ye iʼ their kirks;
18“And ye sal be brocht afore Governors and Kings for my sake, for a testimonie to them and to the nations.
19“But whan they deliver ye up, be‐na fashed aboot hoo or what ye sal say: for in that same ʼoor it sal be gien ye what to say.
20“For it isna ye wha are speakin, but the Spirit oʼ yere Faither wha speaks in ye.
21“And brither sal gie up the brither to deid, and the faither the bairn; and the bairns sal rise up again the parents, and hae them putten to deid.
22“And ye sal be hatit oʼ aʼ folk for the sake oʼ my name; but he wha tholes to the end, that same sal be deliverʼt.
23“But whan they persecute ye iʼ this toun, flee till anither; for truly say I tʼye, Yeʼse no be ower the cities oʼ Israʼl till whan the Son oʼ Man comes!
24“The learner is no aboon the teacher, nor a servant aboon the maister.
25“Eneuch that the learner sud fare as dis the teacher, and the servant like his maister. Gin they caʼ the maister oʼ the hoose Beelzebul, hoo muckle mair them oʼ his househauld?
26“Be‐na fleyʼt at them than; for thar is naething coverʼt that sanna be uncoverʼt; and hid, that sanna be kent.
27“What I tell ye iʼ the mirk, tell ye oot iʼ the licht; and what ye hear whushʼt iʼ the lug, proclaim ye on the hoose‐taps!
28“And dreid‐na them wha slay the body, but canna slay the saul! but raither dreid ye him wha is able to wreck saul and body in hell!
29“Arena twa sparrows gaun for a bodle? And ane frae mang them faʼs‐na on the grund withoot yere Faither!

31“Dinna be dowie, than: ye are better nor mony sparrows!
32“Whasae sal own me afore men, him sal I own afore my Faither wha is in Heeven.
33“But whasae disowns me afore men, him sal I disown afore my Faither wha is in Heeven.
34“Think‐na I am come to cast abreid quateness on the yirth: I come‐na to cast quateness, but a sword.
35“For I am come to set in dispute a man again his faither, and a bride again her gude‐mither;
36“And a manʼs faes are they oʼ his ain hoose.
37“Wha loʼes faither or mither mair nor me, isna wordie oʼ me; and wha loʼes son or dochter mair nor me, isna wordie oʼ me.
38“And wha taks‐na up his cross, to follow me, isna wordie oʼ me.
39“He wha wins his life sal tine it; and wha tines his life for my sake, he sal win it!
40“He wha welcomes you, welcomes me; and he wha welcomes me, welcomes him wha sent me forth.
41“He wha taks in a seer, in the name oʼ a seer, sal receive a seerʼs reward; and he wha taks in a holie man iʼ the name oʼ a holie man, wins a holie manʼs reward.
42“And whasae sal gie to drink til ane oʼ thir wee anes a cup oʼ the cauld watir only, iʼ the name oʼ a disciple — truly I say tʼye, he sanna in onygate tine his reward!”

John Baptist apeirs; and Jesus answers. Folk that wadna speir, and wadna be speirʼt at!
1And it cam aboot, whan Jesus had endit his commauns to his disciples, he gaed on, to teach iʼ their touns.
2Noo whan John, iʼ the prison, had heard oʼ the warks oʼ Christ, he sent twa oʼ his disciples,
3And speirʼt at him, “Are ye He wha comes? Or div we look for some ither ane?”
4Jesus answerʼt, and says till them, “Gang yere ways; and schaw John aʼ that ye see and hear!
5“The blinʼ are gettin their sicht, the lameters walk aboot, the lepers are made clean, the deif are hearin, the deid are raised up, the puir and destitute hae the Blythe‐message proclaimʼt till them!
6“And happy sal he be wha sees nae cause oʼ misdootin in me!”
7And as they gaed their ways, Jesus begude to speir at the thrangs, anent John, “What gaed ye oot intil the muirlands to see? a reed wafflinʼ iʼ the win?
8“But what gaed ye oot to see? a man in braw claes! See! they wha wear braw claes are in kingʼs coorts.
9“But what gaed ye oot for to see? A prophet? Aye! say I tʼye; mair nor a prophet!
10“For this is he oʼ wham it is written, ‘Tent ye! I send oot my messenger afore thy face, wha sal mak gangable thy fit‐path afore thee!’
11“Truly say I tʼye, Amang aʼ thae that are born oʼ weemen, hasna risen ane greater nor John Baptist: yet whasae is wee iʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is greater nor he!
12“And frae John Baptistʼs days the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is in the way oʼ bein reived, and the reiverst ak it by main strenʼth!
13“For aʼ the prophets, and the Law, testifyʼt doon till John.
14“And, gin ye but accept it, this is ‘Elijah,’ wha was to come!
15“He wha has hearin to hear, sae lat him hear!
16“But to what sal I even this race? It is like bairns sittin iʼ the merkit‐place, and cryin oot to their marrows,
17“And sayin, ‘We played till ye, and ye didna dance; we maenʼd till ye, and ye made nae wail!’
18“For John cam, eatin‐na and drinkin‐na, and ye say, ‘He has an evil spirit!’
19“The Son oʼ Man cam, eatin anʼ drinkin; and ye say, ‘See! a man gluttonous! a tippler oʼ wine! a freend oʼ tax‐men and ill‐deedie folk!’ But, ‘What comes oʼ Wisdom vindicates her!’ ”
20Than begude he to challenge thae cities whaur the feck oʼ his great wunner‐warks war dune, for that they repentit‐na:
21“Wae comes till ye, Chorazin! Wae comes till ye, Bethsaida! for gin in Tyre and Sidon had been dune sic wunner‐warks as were dune in you, they wad hae repentit lang syne in tow‐claith and assis!
22“But say I tʼye, it sal be mair tholeable for Tyre and Sidon at the day oʼ Judgment nor for you!
23“And ye, Capernaum! Till Heeven are ye to be raised? Till hell sal ye be dung doon! for gin the warks dune in you had been dune in Sodom, it wad hae been to the fore to this day!
24“But say I tʼye, It sal be mair tholeable for a Land oʼ Sodom in the day oʼ Judgment nor for you!”
25At that time Jesus spak, and said: “I gie thee thanks, O Faither, Lord oʼ Heeven and Yirth! that thou did hide thir things frae the wyss and the discernin, and did schaw them till weans!
26“Aye, Faither! for sae it was gude in thy sicht!
27“Aʼ things are gien to me oʼ my Faither. And nane weel‐kens the Son but the Faither allenarlie, and nane weel‐kens the Faither but only the Son, and he the Son wull schaw him till.
28“Come ye to me, aʼ ye wha toil and moil wiʼ heavy burdens, and I wull gie you rest!
29“Tak my yoke upon ye, and learn ye oʼ me: for I am meek and lown‐heartit, and ye sal finʼ rest tae yer sauls.

2But whan the Pharisees sawʼt, quoʼ they till him, “See! yer disciples are doin whatʼs no allooʼd on the Sabbath!”
3But he answerʼt them, “Hae ye no read what Dauvid did, whan he was hungerʼt, and the anes that were wiʼ him?
4“Hoo he gaed intil Godʼs Hoose, and did eat the Breid oʼ the Presence, whilk was unlawfuʼ for him to eat — and unlawfuʼ for them wiʼ him to eat — but for the priests allenarlie?
5“Or hae ye read‐na iʼ the Law, hoo on the Sabbath‐day the priests iʼ the Temple brek the Sabbath, and sin‐na?
6“But I say tʼye, Thar is Ane here, greater eʼen than the Temple!
7“But gin ye had kent the meaninʼ oʼ this, ‘I choose mercie rather than sacrifeece, ye wadna hae wytit the guiltless!

10And see! a man was thar, wiʼ a wizzenʼt haun. And they speirʼt at him, “Is it richt to heal folk on the Sabbath‐day?” that they micht wyte him.
11And said he to them: “Whatna man is amang ye, wha auchts ae sheep, anʼ ginʼ it faʼ intil a sheugh, wull he no lay haud oʼt, and tak’ it oot?
12“Hoo muckle mair, than, is a man no worth nor a sheep? And sae, it is weel to do gude on the Sabbath‐day.”
13Than said he to the man, “Rax oot yere haun!” And he raxʼt it oot; and it was restorʼt, hale and weel, like the ither.
14Than the Pharisees gaed oot, and counsellʼt thegither, how they micht mak awaʼ wiʼ him.
15But Jesus, kennin it, withdrew frae that place; and great thrangs followʼt him; and he healʼd them aʼ;
16Chairgin them that they soudna mak him kent;
17That it micht come to pass what Esaiah spak, whan he said:
18“Tent ye, my Servant, my Chosen, my Beloved! My saul is weel‐pleased in him. I wull lay my Spirit on him, and he sal schaw true judgment to the nations.
19“He sal mak nae tulzie, nor cryin; and nae man sal hear his voice iʼ the streets.
20“A dentit reed he braks‐na, and the ill‐luntit tow he staps‐na, till true judgment he sends on to victory.
21“And on his name sal the nations lippen.”
22Than was brocht till him ane possessʼd wiʼ a demon, blinʼ and dumb: and he healʼd him, sae that the dumb man spak and lookit.
23And aʼ the folk war astonishʼt: and quoʼ they, “Is this no Dauvidʼs Son?”
24But whan the Pharisees heard that, quoʼ they, “This ane casts‐na oot demons but throwe Beelzebul, the prince oʼ the demons!”
25But, kennin their thochts, he said to them, “Ilka Kingdom workin again itsel is brocht to waste; and ilka citie or hoose workin again itsel canna staun?
26“And gin Sautan cast oot Sautan, he is workin again himsel; hoo than wull he mak his kingdom staun?
27“And gin I throwe Beelzebul cast oot demons, wha casts them oot by yere ain sons? Sae they sal eʼen be yere judges.
28“But gin I by the Spirit oʼ God hae cuisten them oot, that the pooer oʼ God has come on ye!

33“Mak aither gude the tree and gude the frute; or els mak ill the tree and ill the frute; for the tree is kent by its frute.

37“For by yere words sal ye be acceptit, and by yere words sal ye be hauden guilty.”
38Than some oʼ the Writers and Pharisees answerʼt, sayin, “Maister, we wad see a token frae thee!”
39But he answerʼt to them, “An ill‐doin and adulterous race seek for a token; and nae token sal be gien tillʼt, but the token oʼ Jonah the prophet.
40“For as Jonah was thrie days and thrie nichts iʼ the wame oʼ the sea‐monster, sae sal the Son oʼ Man be iʼ the heart oʼ the yirth thrie days and thrie nichts.
41“The folk oʼ Nineveh sal rise in judgment wiʼ this race, and condemn it; for they turned at Jonahʼs preachin; and mark! Ane greater nor Jonah is here!

3And he spak mony things to them in parables; and quoʼ he: “Tak tent: The sawer gaed oot to saw.
4“And in his sawin, a neiffuʼ was mis‐cuisten on the fit‐path, and eaten up wiʼ the birdies.
5“Some fell on the staney bits, whaur the yird was jimp; and it brairdit bonnie, for the mool was thin.
6“And whan the sun raise heigh, it birslʼt up; and, for that it had nae rute, it dwined awa.
7“And some fell whaur thorns had been; and up cam the thorns, and smoored it.
8“And some fell on the gude grunʼ, and brocht forth frute — this a hunner, that saxty, and the ither thretty.
9“Wha has lugs for hearin, lat him hear!”
10And, drawin nar, his disciples say, “Why soud ye speak to them in parables?”
11And he answerʼt them, “It is, that till you it has been gien to ken oʼ the things oʼ the Heevenlie Kingdom: but to them it isna sae gien.
12“For wha has, to him sal be gien, and he sal hae rowth oʼt; but wha hasna, frae him sal be taen awa eʼen what he has!
13“Sae, speak I to them by parables: for they, seein, are blinʼ; and they, hearin, are deif; naither div they ken.
14“And wiʼ them is brocht to pass the prophecy oʼ Esaiah, whilk says: ‘Wiʼ hearin ye sal hear, and in naegate understaun; and seein ye sal see and in naegate perceive.
15“ ‘For this peopleʼs heart is gross, and their lugs are dull oʼ hearinʼ, and their een hae they steekit; least they soud see wiʼ their een, and hear wiʼ their lugs, and understaun wiʼ their heart, and turn again and I soud heal them!’
16“But fair faʼ yere een, that they see! and yere lugs, that they hear!
17“For truly say I tʼye, that a hantle oʼ prophets and holie men war fain to see the things ye see, and saw them‐na; and to hear the things ye hear, and heard them‐na!
18“Hear ye than the parable oʼ The Sawer:
19“Whan ony ane hears the word oʼ the Kingdom, and understauns‐it‐na, than comes the Ill Ane, and cleeks awa that sawn in his heart: this is he sawn by the fit‐path.
20“And he on the staney bit sawn, is he wha hears the word, and blythely receives it;
21“Yet has he nae rute in himsel, and bides but for a wee; and on dool or fash comin, he stumbles belyve.
22“And he sawn amang the thorns, this is he wha hears the word, and than the cark oʼ the warlʼ, and the glamor oʼ riches, smoor the word, and it bears nae frute.
23“But he sawn on the gude grunʼ, this is he wha baith hears and understauns the word; wha eʼen brings forth frute; and gies, this a hunner, that saxty, and the ither thretty.”
24Anither parable set he afore them; and quoʼ he: “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to a man, wha sawed gude seed in his croft;
25“But whan folk war sleepin, cam his fae, and sawed tares amang the wheat, and slippit awa.
26“But whan the wheat brairdit and brocht forth frute, than schawed the tares as weel.
27“Sae cam the servants oʼ the gudeman, and quoʼ they to him, ‘Sir, did‐ye‐na saw gude seed iʼ yere croft? Frae whatna way than has it tares?’
28“And he said to them, ‘Some enemy has dune this!’ And quoʼ the servants to him, ‘Wull ye hae us gang and gaither them up?’
29“But quoʼ he, ‘Na; least as ye gaither up the tares, ye puʼ up the wheat wiʼ them!’
30“ ‘Lat baith grow thegither till the hairst; and at hairst‐time I wull say to the shearers, “Gaither ye thegither the tares first, and burn them; but gaither ye the wheat intil my barn.’ ”
31Anither parable set he afore them, sayinʼ, “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like a mustard‐seed, whilk a man took, and plantit in his yaird.
32“Whilk in sooth is smaʼest oʼ aʼ seeds, but whan it is grown is the biggest oʼ aʼ yerbs, and comes to be a tree, sae that the birdies oʼ the lift come and howff in its branches.”
33Anither parable set he afore them: “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like till risin, whilk a wife took and pat in a firlot oʼ meal, till the hail was risen.”
34Aʼ thae things spak Jesus to the folk in parables; and wantin a parable spak‐he‐na to them,
35That it soud come to pass what was said by the prophet, “I will open my mouʼ in parables; I will gie oot things keepit hidin frae the warldʼs fundation.”
36Than he pairtit frae the thrangs, and gied intil the hoose: and his disciples cam till him, and quoʼ they, “Expone to us the parable oʼ the Tares oʼ the Croft!”
37He answerʼt, and quoʼ he to them, “He wha sawed the gude seed is the Son oʼ Man.
38“The croft is the warld; the gude seed are the bairns oʼ the Kingdom; but the tares are the bairns oʼ the Ill Ane.
39“The enemie that sawed them is Sautan; the hairst is the endin oʼ the warld, and the shearers are the Angels.
40“And eʼen as the tares are gaitherʼt and burnt iʼ the fire, sae sal it be at the end oʼ the warld.
41“The Son oʼ Man sal send oot his Angels, and they sal gaither oot oʼ his kingdom aʼ things that ensnare, and aʼ that do ill;
42“And sal cast them intil the lowin furnace; there sal be maenin and cherkin oʼ teeth!
43“Than sal the richtous glint forth like the sun, iʼ their Faitherʼs Kingdom. Wha has hearin to hear, lat him hear!
44“Ance again: The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to gear, hidlins in a field; the same, when a man has fund, he hides again, and for the joy oʼt gangs and niffersʼ aʼ that he has, and buys that field.
45“Again, the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to a tradin‐man, seekin precious pearls:
46“Wha, whan he has fund ae pearl oʼ aʼ price, gaed and sellʼt aʼ he had, and coft it.
47“Again, the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like a net cuisten intil the sea, and it gaitherʼt oʼ aʼ kinds:
48“Whilk, when it was fuʼ, they harlʼt tae the shore, and they sut them doon and waled oot the gude intil creels, but cuist the bad awa.
49“Sae sal it be at the end oʼ the warld: the Angels sal come forrit and wale oot the wicked frae amang the gude;
50“And sal cast them into the lowin furnace: there sal he maenin and cherkin oʼ teeth!”
51And quoʼ Jesus to them: “Hae ye understude aʼ thir things?” Quoʼ they till him: “Aye, Lord!”
52Than said he to them, “Ilka scribe wiʼ the lear oʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven, is like till ane that is heid oʼ a hoose, wha can fesh oot oʼ his presses things baith new and auld.”
53And it cam aboot, that whan Jesus had made an end oʼ his parables, he gaed frae that place.
54And whan he was come intil his ain kintra‐side, he was teachin them iʼ their ain kirk, sae that they war astonishʼt, and quoʼ they: “Whaur gat this man this wisdom, and thir ferlies?
55“Isna this the wrichtʼs son? And isna his mother caʼd ‘Mary’? And his brithers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judah?
56“And his sisters, arena they aʼ wiʼ us? Frae whaurawa, than, has this man thir things?”
57And they took a scunner at him. But Jesus said to them: “A Prophet is nevir wantin honour, binna it be in his ain kintra‐side, and amang his ain folk.”
58And he wrocht na mony wunner‐warks thar, because oʼ their unbelievin.

Herod slays John. Breid iʼ the wilderness, Christʼs fit‐road on the sea.
1Aboot that time Herod, the King‐Depute, heard aʼ that was said aboot Jesus.
2And quoʼ he to them oʼ his hoosehauld, “This maun be John the Baptist; he is risen frae the deid; and sae div thir pooers schaw theirsels in him.”
3For Herod had grippit John, and putten him in bonds; and cuist him intil prison for the sake oʼ Herodias, wife oʼ his brither Philip.
4For John said till him: “It is no allooʼd for ye to hae her!”
5And whan he wad hae putten him to deid, he was fleyʼt oʼ the people, for they reckonʼd him a Prophet.
6But whan Herodʼs birthday cam, the daughter oʼ Herodias danced in the mids oʼ them aʼ, and glamorʼd Herod.
7Whauron, he sware to gie her onything she micht speir.
8And she, bein set on by her mither, said: “Gie me here John Baptistʼs heid, on an aschet!”
9And the king was wae; but for the sake oʼ his aiths, and for thae that sat at meat wiʼ him, he commandit it to be gien to her.
10And he sent, and beheidit John iʼ the prison.
11And his heid was brocht on an aschet, and gien to the lass; and she brocht it till her mither.
12And his disciples cam, and took up the body, and buryʼt it; and gaed and tellʼt Jesus.
13And whan Jesus heard it, he gaed awa by boat till a desert‐place oot‐by; and whan the croods heard oʼt, they followʼt on fit frae the toons.
14And he cam oot, and saw a great thrang; and he had pitie on them and healed their sick anes.
15And whan the eʼenin cam on, his disciples cam till him, and quoʼ they, “This is but a desert bit, and the time is gaun by; send the folk awa, that they may gang to the neebor toons, and buy theirsels meat!”
16But Jesus said to them, “They need‐na gang awa; gie ye them to eat!”
17Quoʼ they to him, “We hae here but fyve bannocks and twa fish.”
18He said, “Fesh them here to me!”
19And he garʼt the crood sit doon on the gerss; and took the fyve bannocks and the twa speldrins, and lookin up till Heeven he gied thanks, and brak, and gied the bannocks to the disciples, and the disciples to the folk.
20And they aʼ did eat, and war satisfyʼt; and they liftit oʼ the broken bits that war left, twal baskets fuʼ.
21And they wha had eaten war aboot fyve thoosand men, forby weemen and weans.
22And at ance he garʼt his disciples gang intil the boat, and gang awa first to the ither side, till he wad send the crood awa.
23And whan he had sent the crood awa, he gaed up intil a mountain by his‐sel to pray; and whan eʼenin fell he was thar alane.
24But the boat was noo iʼ the mids oʼ the Loch, vexʼd wiʼ the waves: for the wund was contrar.
25And iʼ the hinmaist watch oʼ the nicht Jesus cam to them, gangin on the sea.
26And whan the disciples saw him walkin on the sea, they war sair gliffʼt, saying, “It is a ghaist!” And they cryʼt oot for fear.
27And at ance Jesus spak to them, “Be oʼ gude heart! It is I; fear‐na!”
28And Peter answerʼt and quoʼ he, “Lord, gin it be thou, bid me come till thee on the watir!”
29And he said, “Come!” And whan Peter was gotten doon oot oʼ the boat, he walkit on the watir to gang tae Jesus.
30But whan he saw the wund gousty, he fearʼt; and as he begude to sink he cryʼt oot, “Lord, save me!”
31And at ance Jesus raxed oot his haun, and grippit him, saying to him, “O thou oʼ sic smaʼ faith, why did thou fear?”
32And whan they war gane up intil the boat, the wund was lown.
33And they iʼ the boat worshippʼt him, saying, “Truly thou art the Son oʼ God!”
34And whan they gat ower, they cam to the land, to Gennesaret.
35And whan the men oʼ that place had kennin oʼ him, they sent oot intil aʼ the kintra‐side, and feshʼt till him aʼ that war ailin;

21And Jesus gaed thence, and cam to the pairts oʼ Tyre and Sidon.
22And see! a Canaanite wumman cam oot frae thae pairts, and cryʼt oot till him; and quoʼ she, “Hae pitie on me, O Lord, thou Son oʼ Dauvid! my dochter is sair vexʼt wiʼ a demon!”

15“And gin yere brither‐man sin again ye, gang to him, and schaw him his faut atween you and him alane: gin he harken to ye, ye hae won yere brither‐man.
16“But gin he winna harken to ye, than tak wiʼ ye ane or twa mair, sae that at the mooth oʼ twa or thrie witnesses, ilk word may be made siccar.
17“And gin aiblins he winna hear them, tell it to the kirk; and gin he winna hear the kirk, than lat him be to ye as a fremʼd ane, or ane oʼ the tax‐men.
18“Truly say I tʼye, whatsoeʼer ye bind fast on the yirth, sal be bunʼ fast in Heeven; and what ye lowse on yirth sal be lowsed in Heeven.
19“And ance mair say I tʼye, that gin twa oʼ ye mak it up on the yirth what ye sal ask for, it sal be dune for them by my Faither in Heeven.
20“For whaur the twa or the thrie are forgatherʼt iʼ my name, thar am I iʼ the midsʼ oʼ them.”
21Than Peter comes forrit till him, and quoʼ he, “Lord, hoo aft may my brither‐man sin again me, and I maun forgie him? Seeven times?”
22Jesus said to him, “I say tʼye, No till seeven times, but seeventy times and seeven!
23“And sae is the Kingdom oʼ Heeven like to a certain king wha wad hae a reckonin wiʼ his servants.
24“And whan he had begude to reckon, ane was brocht till him wha was awn him ten thoosanʼ talents.
25“And haein nocht to pay, his maister orderʼt him to be sellʼt, and his wife, and weans, and aʼ that he had; and payment to be made.
26“The servant than fell doon and worshippʼt him, cryin, ‘Lord, thole ye wiʼ me, and I wull pay ye aʼ!’
27“Than, moved wiʼ pitie, that servantʼs lord lowsed him, and forgae him the debt.
28“And that same servant, gaun oot, fand ane oʼ his fellow‐servants wha was awn him a hunner pennies; and he laid haud oʼ him, and grippit him by the hauss, cryin, ‘Pay me what ye are awn!’
29“And his fellow‐servant fell doon at his feet, and besocht him: ‘Thole ye wiʼ me, and I wull pay ye aʼ!’
30“And he wadna, but gaed and had him cuisten intil prison, till he soud pay what was awn.
31“Sae whan his fellow‐servants saw what was dune, they war unco wae, and cam and tellʼt their maister aʼ that was dune.
32“Than his lord caʼd for him, and quoʼ he to him, ‘O, ye ill‐deedie servant! I forgae ye aʼ that debt, for that ye did beseech me:
33“ ‘Soud‐ye‐na had rewth on yere fellow‐servant, eʼen as I had mercie on you?’
34“And his lord was sair angerʼt, and gied him ower to the officers, till he soud pay aʼ that was awn to him.
35“Eʼen sae sal my Heevenlie Faither do to you, gin ye forgie‐na ilk ane his brither‐man frae yere hearts!”

CHAPTIR NINETEEN.
Marriage and Divorce. His hauns and blessin on the wee bairns. Aboot grace and gear.
1And it cam aboot, that whan Jesus had made an end oʼ thae words, he quat Galilee, and cam intil the pairts oʼ Judea ayont Jordan.
2And great croods followʼt him; and he healed them thar.
3And Pharisees cam to him, way?-?layin him, and sayin, “Isʼt lawfuʼ for a man to pit awa his wife, for ony cause ava?”
4And he answerʼt, and quoʼ he to them, “Hae‐ye‐na read hoo he wha made them at the beginnin, made them male and female.
5“And said, ‘For this wull a man leaʼ his faither and his mither, and be joined to his wife, and they twa sal be ae flesh!’
6“Sae that they are nae mair twa, but ae flesh. And sae what God has joined thegither, lat‐na man pit sindry!”
7They say to him, “Hoo than did Moses commaun to gie her a writin oʼ divorcement, and to pit awa?”
8He says to them, “Moses, for the hardness oʼ yere hearts, tholed that ye sould pit awa yere wives; but frae the beginnin it wasna sae.
9“And I say to ye, that whasae sal pit awa his wife, let‐abee for adultery, and sal wed anither, commits adultery; and wha weds the divorced wumman commits adultery.”
10His disciples say to him, “Gin it be sae wiʼ a man and his wife, it isna gude to mairry!”
11But he said to them, “Aʼ cannaʼ tak in this sayin; but only thae to wham it is gien.
12“For thar are some eunuchs frae their mitherʼs womb; and thar are some sae, made eunuchs by men; and thar are some that hae made theirsel sae for the Kingdom oʼ Heevenʼs sake. Wha has strenʼth to tak it in, lat him tak it in!”
13Than war brocht till him wee bairns, that he soud pit hauns on them, and gie them his blessin: and the disciples challenged them.
14But Jesus said, “Lat the wee bairns come to me, and dinna forbid them; for sic anes mak up the Kingdom oʼ Heeven!”
15And he pat his hauns on them; and gaed awa.
16And see! ane cam till him, and quoʼ he, “Maister! Whatna gude thing sal I dae, that I may win Eternal Life?”
17And he says to him, “Why div ye speir aboot that whilk is gude? Ane thar is wha is gude; that is God! But gin ye wad enter intil Life, keep the Commaunments.”
18He speirʼt at him, “Whilk?” And Jesus said to him, “ ‘Ye sanna kill; ye sanna commit adultery; ye sanna bear fause‐witness;
19“ ‘Honor yere faither and yere mither; and ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yersel!’ ”
20The lad says, “Aʼ thir I keep! What want I yet?”
21Jesus says to him, “Gin ye wad be perfete, gang and sell aʼ ye hae, and gie it oot to the puir; and ye sal hae gear laid up in Heeven; and come, follow me!”
22But whan the young man heard that sayin, he gaed awa dowie; for he had great estates.
23And Jesus said till his disciples, “It is no an easy thing for a man oʼ muckle gear to enter the Kingdom oʼ Heeven!
24“Aye, say I tʼye, it is easier for a camel to threid a needleʼs ee, than ane rich to enter the Kingdom oʼ Heeven!”
25Whan the disciples heard it thev ferlied uncolie; and quoʼ they, “Wha than can be savʼt?”
26And Jesus, dwallin on them wiʼ his een, said, “Wiʼ men, this wad be impossible; but no wiʼ God. For wiʼ God, aʼ things can be possible!”
27Peter answerʼt, and quoʼ he, “We hae left aʼ to follow thee; what sal we hae, than?”
28And Jesus said to them, “In the Aʼ‐Things‐New, whan the Son oʼ Man sal sit on the thron oʼ his glorie, ye as weel sal sit on twalʼ throns, ower the Twalʼ Tribes oʼ Israʼl.
29“And ilka ane forsakin hooses, or brethren, or sisters, or faither or mither, or bairns, or mailin, for my nameʼs sake — sal hae a hunner‐fauld, and sal inherit Life Eternal!
30“But mony first sal be hin maist; and hinmaist first.

The laborers. The ambition oʼ twa. The blinʼ garʼt to see.
1“For the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like till a man, a laird, wha gaed oot iʼ the dawin, to hire workers intil his vine‐yaird.
2“And whan he had ʼgreeʼt wiʼ the laborers for a hauf‐merk a day, he sent them intil his vine‐yaird.
3“And he gaed oot aboot the chap oʼ nine, and saw ither anes staunin idle iʼ the merkit.
4“And quoʼ he to them, ‘Gang ye as weel intil the vine‐yaird, and whateʼer is richt, ye sal hae!’ And they gaed their ways.
5“And again he gaed oot aboot twalʼ, and thrie oʼclock, and did the same.
6“And at fyve he gaed oot, and faund mair staunin; and, quoʼ he, ‘Hoo isʼt ye staun here, idle aʼ the day?’
7“They say, ‘For that nae man feeʼd us!’ He says to them, ‘Gang ye as weel intil the vine‐yaird; and whateʼer is richt, that sal ye hae!’
8“Sae whan gloamin was come, the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird says to his grieve, ‘Caʼ the workers; and gie them their fee; beginnin frae the hinmaist doon to the first.’
9“And whan they oʼ fyve oʼclock cam, they gat ilk man a hauf‐merk.
10“And whan the first cam, they trowʼd to hae gotten mair; and they, as weel, gat ilka man a hauf‐merk.
11“And whan they gat it, they yammerʼt again the gudeman,
12“Saying, ‘Thir last anes hae putten‐in ae ʼoor, and ye hae made them even wiʼ us, wha hae dreed the weary cark and scouther oʼ the day!’
13“But he answerʼt ane oʼ them, and quoʼ he, ‘Freend, I do ye nae wrang! Did‐ye‐na tak‐on wiʼ me for a hauf‐merk?
14“ ‘Tak what belangs tʼye, and gang yere gate! It is my wull to gie to this last eʼen as to you.
15“ ‘Isʼt no richt to hae my ain wull in my ain things? Is your ee skellied because I am upricht?’
16“Sae the hinmaist sal be first, and the first hinmaist. For mony are bidden, but no aʼ acceptit.”
17And as Jesus was gaun up to Jerusalem, he took aside the twalʼ disciples, and on the way said to them,
18“Noo, we gang up to Jerusalem, and the Son oʼ Man sal be betrayʼt to the Heid‐Priests and the Writers, and they sal doom him to death;
19“And sal set him ower to the heathen to mock, and to clour, and to crucify; and on the third day he sal rise again.”
20Than cam till him the mither oʼ Zebedeeʼs sons, wiʼ her sons, worshippin him, and seeking a thing frae him.
21And he says to her, “What wad ye?” Quoʼ she till him, “Commaun that thir my twa sons may sit, the ane on thy richt haun, and the ither on thy left haun, iʼ thy Kingdom!”
22But Jesus answerʼt and said, “Ye kenna what ye seek! Are ye fit to drink oʼ the cup I am to drink oʼ?” They say till him, “We are fit!”
23He says to them, “Ye sal truly drink my cup; but to sit on my richt haun and on my left haun, isna mine to gie, but to thae my Faither has preparʼt it for.”
24And the Ten, hearin it, war unco angry again the twa brithers.
25But Jesus caʼd them till him, and said, “Ye aʼ ken hoo the rulers oʼ the nations lord it ower the folk, and their great anes exerceese authoritie amang them;
26“But sae it sanna be amang you; but whasae wad be heigh amang ye, lat him be yere servitor;
27“And whasae wad be first amang ye, lat him be yere thirlman.
28“Eʼen as the Son oʼ Man cam‐na to be serʼt, but to serʼ; and to gie up his life a ransom for mony.”
29And whan they gaed on frae Jericho, a great crood followʼt him.
30And lo! twa blinʼ men, sittin by the wayside, whaneʼer they kent that Jesus gaed by, cryʼt out, “Lord, hae mercie on us, thou Son oʼ Dauvid!”
31And the folk challenged them, that they soud haud their whisht. But they skreighʼt oot the mair, “Lord, hae mercie on us, thou Son oʼ Dauvid!”
32And, comin till a staun, Jesus caʼd them; and said, “What isʼt ye wad hae me do for ye?”
33They say till him, “Lord, that oor een micht be unsteekit!”
34And Jesus, led wiʼ compassion, touched their een; and at ance they wan their sicht; and they followʼt him.

CHAPTIR TWENTY‐ANE.
The entry intil Jerusalem. The feckless fig‐tree. The ill‐deedie gardeners.
1And whan they wan nar Jerusalem, and war come till Bethphage, at the Mount oʼ Olives, Jesus sent forrit twa oʼ his disciples.
2Sayin to them, “Gang yere ways to the toun fornent ye, and ye sal finʼ at ance an ass tetherʼt, and a cowt wiʼ her; lowse them, and lead them to me.
3“And gin ony ane challenge ye, say, ‘The Lord has need oʼ them;’ and at ance they wull send them.”
4Noo this was sae, that it soud be fulfilled that was said by the prophet:
5“Tell ye Zionʼs dochter. Tak tent! thy King comes to thee, lowly, and ridin on an ass; and a cowt, the foal oʼ a toilin ass.”
6And the disciples, doin as Jesus appointit them,
7Feshʼd the ass and the cowt, and they laid on their mantles; and he sat thar‐on.
8And a hantle oʼ the thrang spread their mantles iʼ the way; ithers cuttit branches frae the trees, and strinkled them iʼ the way.
9And aʼ the folk that gaed on afore, and they that cam ahint, cryʼt, sayin, “Hosanna to the Son oʼ Dauvid! Blessed is he comin iʼ the name oʼ the Lord! Hosanna iʼ the heighest Heevens!”
10And whan he was come tae Jerusalem, aʼ the citie was putten aboot, speirin, “Wha is this?”
11And aʼ the folk said, “This is Jesus the Prophet — frae Nazareth oʼ Galilee!”
12And Jesus gaed intil the Temple, and drave oot aʼ that sellʼt and bocht iʼ the Temple, and whammlʼt ower the tables oʼ the nifferers oʼ siller, and the binks oʼ thae that sellʼt doos.
13And said to them, “It is putten‐doon, ‘My Hoose sal be caʼd a Hoose oʼ Prayer,’ but ye mak’ it a howff oʼ robbers!”
14And there cam till him iʼ the Temple the blinʼ and the lameters; and he healed them.
15But whan the Heid‐Priests and the Writers saw the ferlies that he did, and the bairns cryin oot iʼ the Temple, and sayinʼ “Hosanna to the Son oʼ Dauvid!” they war sair vexed;
16And quoʼ they till him, “Hear‐ye‐na what thir anes say?” And Jesus says to them, “Aye! And hae‐ye‐na read, ‘Oot oʼ bairnsʼ and sucklinsʼ mouʼs hast thou ordeenʼt thy praise!’ ”
17And he left them, and gaed oot oʼ the city to Bethanie, and lodged the nicht thar.
18And comin back early tae the city he hungerʼt.
19And seein a fig‐tree by the way, he cam tillʼt and fund naething onʼt but leaves; and quoʼ he, “Lat thar be nae frute oʼ thee frae this forrit, for evir!” And belyve, the fig‐tree dwined awa!
20And whan the disciples saw it, they ferlied uncolie, sayin, “Hoo sune did the fig‐tree dwine awa!”
21And Jesus answerʼt, and said to them, “Truly say I tʼye, Gin ye hae faith, ye mayna only do as is dune to the fig‐tree, but aiblins ye may say to this mountain, ‘Flit thou, and faʼ intil the sea!’ it sal be dune.
22“And ye sal winʼ aʼ things — whatsoeʼer ye ask in prayer, believin.”
23And whan he was come intil the Temple, the Heid‐Priests and the Elders oʼ the people cam till him as he was teachin, and quoʼ they, “By whatna authoritie div ye do thir things? And wha gied ye this authoritie?”
24And, answerin, Jesus said to them, “I wull ask you ae quaisten as weel; and gin ye answer me, I wull tell ye by whatna authoritie I do thir things.
25“The bapteezin oʼ John — whaur cam it frae? Frae Heeven? or oʼ men!” And they counsellʼt amang theirsels, sayin, “Gin we say, ‘Frae Heeven,’ he wull say to us, ‘Why, than, dinna ye believe him?’
26“But gin we say, ‘Frae men,’ we are fleyʼt oʼ the people; for they aʼ haud John as a Prophet.”
27And they answerʼt Jesus, and said, “We canna tell.” And than he, too, says to them, “And naither div I tell you by what authoritie I do thir things!
28“But hoo div ye judge noo? A man had twa sons; and he cam to the first ane, and quoʼ he, ‘Son, gang and work, the day, in my vine‐yaird!’
29“He, answerin, said, ‘I winna!’ but eftir, he bethocht him, and gaed.
30“And he cam to the second, and said the like; and he answerʼt, and quoʼ he, ‘I — aye, Sir!’ and gaed‐na.
31“Whilk oʼ thae twa did his faitherʼs wull?” They say till him, “The first ane.” Jesus says to them, “Truly say I tʼye, that the tax‐men and the harlots gang intil the Kingdom oʼ Heeven afore ye!
32“For John cam to ye, schawin richtousness; and ye wadna believe him. And ye, seein it aʼ, didna eʼen repent eftirhaun, that ye micht lippen till him.
33“Hear ye anither parable: Thar was a laird wha plantit a vine‐yaird, and dykit it roond aboot, and howkit a wine‐vat inʼt, and biggit a tooer, and lat it oot to crofters, and gaed awa till anither land.
34“And whan the time oʼ frutinʼ drew nar, he sent his servants to the crofters to receive his frutes.
35“And the crofters took his servants, and they cloured ane, and slew anither, and staned anither.
36“And again, he sent ither servants, mair in number than the first anes; and they did to them the same.
37“But eftir, he sent to them his son, sayin, ‘They will honour my son.’
38“The crofters, howbeit, seein the son, said amang theirsels, ‘This is the heir! Come, let us slay him, and tak his inheritance.’
39“And they took him, and cuist him oot the vine‐yaird, and killed him.
40“Whan, tharfor, the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird sal come, what wull he do to thae crofters?”
41They say to him, “Unco destruction sal he bring on thae wicked men; and wull lat oot the vine‐yaird to ither crofters, wha wull render him the frutes iʼ their seasons!”
42Jesus says to them, “Did ye nevir read iʼ the word, ‘The stane rejeckit oʼ the masons, the same was made the heid oʼ the corner. Frae the Lord was this: and an unco ferlie in oor eʼen!’
43“Tharfor say I tʼye, The Kingdom oʼ God sal be taʼen awa frae ye, and gien till a nation bringin forth the frutes oʼt.
44“And wha faʼs on this stane sal be sairly cloured; but on wham it may faʼ, it wull grind him to poother!”
45And the Heid‐Priests and Pharisees, hearing his parables, jaloused that he spak oʼ them.
46But whan they socht to grip him, they fearʼt the crood; for they did haud him as a Prophet.

The Royal Bridal. The girns set by the Pharisees and Sadducees.
1And answerinʼ, Jesus spak to them again in parables; and quoʼ he:
2“The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to a King, wha made a Bridal‐feast for his son.
3“And sent oot his servin‐men to tell them wha had a bode; and they wadna come.
4“And he sent oot mair servants; and quoʼ he, ‘Tell them that are bidden, See! I hae gotten ready my denner; my owsen and my fed things are killed, and aʼ is ready. Come tae the Bridal‐feast.’
5“But they geckʼt at it, and gaed their gate, ane to his ain mailin, and anither to his wares.
6“And the lave grippit his servin‐men, and ill‐treatit them, and slew them.
7“And the King was sair angerʼt; and he sent oot his airmies and destroyed thae men‐slayers, and brunt their toon.
8“Than said the King, ‘The Bridal‐feast is aʼ ready, but they bidden warna wordie;
9“Gang ye tharfor to the pairtin oʼ the ways; and aʼ, eʼen as mony as ye finʼ, caʼ to the feast!’
10“And thae servants gaed oot intil the heigh‐roads, and gatherʼt thegither aʼ, eʼen as mony as they faund, baith ill and weel faurʼd; and the bridal had its guests.
11“But the King, comin ben to see the guests, spied a man wantin a waddin garment.
12“And speirs at him, ‘Freend! hoo cam ye here, wantin a waddin‐garment?’ and he had nocht to say.
13“Than said the King to his servants, ‘Bind him haun‐and‐fit, and cast him oot intil the deid‐mirk; thar wull be greetin and cherkin oʼ teeth!’
14“For a hantle are bidden: but only a wheen waled oot.”
15Then gaed the Pharisees, and counsellʼt thegither hoo they micht fank him in his talk.
16And they sent their disciples to him, wiʼ them oʼ Herodʼs pairty, and quoʼ they, “Maister! we ken ye are leal and true, and teach Godʼs ways truly, and swither for nae man; for ye look‐na on the person oʼ men:—
17“Tell us than what think ye? Isʼt weel to gie dues to Cesar, or no?”
18But Jesus, takin tent oʼ their wickedness, said to them, “Why fausely deal wiʼ me, ye hypocrites?
19“Schaw me the siller for the dues!” And they brocht to him a siller penny.
20And he says to them, “Whase is this heid, and this inscription?”
21They say to him, “Cesarʼs.” Than says he to them, “Gie to Cesar Cesarʼs things; and to God Godʼs things!”
22And whan they heard, they ferlied uncolie; and leaʼin him, gaed their gate.
23That vera day cam till him the Sadducees, wha say thar is nae Risin‐again, and they speirʼt at him:—
24“Maister, Moses said, ‘Gin a man soud dee, leaʼin nae bairn, his brither sal mairry his wife, and rear up seed till his brither.’
25“Noo thar war wiʼ us seeven brithers; and the first eftir mairryin, deeʼt; and haein nae bairn, left his wife to his brither.
26“In like mainner the second, and the third, eʼen to the seeventh.
27“And eftir them aʼ, the wife deeʼt.
28“At the Great Risin, than, whase wife sal she be oʼ the seeven? for they aʼ had her?”
29Jesus answerʼt them, and quoʼ he: “Ye are aʼ wrang! for ye ken naither the Scripturs nor the pooer oʼ God!
30“For in the Risin‐again, they naither wed nor are gien in wedlock; but are as the Angels in Heeven.
31“But, anent the Risin‐oʼ‐the Deid, hae ye no read what God spak tʼye, sayin:
32“ ‘I am the God oʼ Abraʼm; and Isaacʼs God, and Jaucobʼs God!’ He isna the God oʼ deid men, but leevin!”
33And aʼ the folk, hearin it, ferlied muckle at his teachin.
34But the Pharisees, whan they heard he had putten the Sadducees to silence, forgatherʼt;
35And ane frae mang them speirʼt at him a quaisten, testin him, and sayin,
36“Maister! whilk is the great commaun oʼ the Law?”
37Jesus says till him, “ ‘Ye sal loʼe the Lord yere God wiʼ yere hail heart, and wiʼ yere hail saul, and wiʼ yere hail mind!’
38“This is the great and first commaun.
39“And a second ane is like tillʼt; ‘Ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yersel.’
40“On thir twa commauns hing aʼ the Law and the Prophets.”
41Noo, while the Pharisees war gaitherʼt thegither, Jesus speirʼt at them:
42“What think ye aboot the Anointit Ane? Whase Son is he?” They say to him, “Dauvidʼs son.”
43He said to them, “Hoo than dis Dauvid caʼ him ‘Lord?’ sayin,
44“ ‘Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit thou on my richt haun, till I mak thy faes thy fit‐brod.’
45“Seeing Dauvid caʼs him ‘Lord,’ hoo is he his son?”
46And nae man was fit to answer him a word: naither, frae that day forrit daur ony man to speir at him ony mair quaistens.

The desperate corruption oʼ the Pharisees. Jerusalem bewailed.
1Than spak Jesus to aʼ the folk, and till his disciples:
2“The Writers and the Pharisees are sutten doon in Mosesʼ seat.
3“Aʼ things tharfor they bid ye do, observe them. But follow‐na eftir their warks: for they say, and do‐na.
4“And they bind heavy burdens, and lay them on the shouthers oʼ men; but they winna move them wiʼ ae fingʼer.
5“For they mak braid their amulets and enlairge their tassels,
6“And seek for the first seats at feasts, and heid places iʼ the kirks,
7“And courtesie iʼ the merkits, and to be caʼd ‘Maister! Maister!’ oʼ men.
8“But be‐na ye caʼd ‘Maister;’ for ye hae ae Maister, Christ; and aʼ ye are brethren.
9“And caʼ nae man ‘Faither,’ on the yirth; for Ane is yere Faither — the Heevenlie.
10“Nor be ye caʼd ‘Leaders;’ for Ane is yere Leader, Christ.
11“But the ane wha is greatest amang ye sal be the ane that serʼs.
12“And whasae sal mak himsel heigh, sal be puʼd doon; and whasae sal abase himsel sal be upliftit.
13“But wae for ye, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye steek up the Kingdom oʼ Heeven afore men wha wad gang in; ye naither gang in yersels, nor alloo them to gang in wha wad!
14“Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye devoor weedowsʼ hooses, eʼen while ye are makin lang prayers: sae sal ye hae the wechtier judgment!
15“Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye gang ower yirth and sea to bring in ae disciple; and whan he is sae become, ye mak him twafauld mair a son oʼ hell than yersels!
16“Wae for you, ye blinʼ leaders! whilk say, ‘Wha sal sweer by the Temple, it is nocht; but wha sweers by the Templeʼs gowd, he is hauden!’
17“O fules and blinʼ! Whilk is greater, the gowd, or the Temple that hallows the gowd?
18“And, ‘Wha sweers by the offeran‐stane, it is nocht; but wha sweers by the offeran onʼt, he is hauden!’
19“O blinʼ! For whilk is mair, the offeran, or the Altar‐stane that hallows the offeran?
20“Wha, tharfor, sweers by the offeran‐stane, sweers by it, and by aʼ things onʼt.
21“And wha sweers by the Temple, sweers by it, and by Him that dwalls within.
22“And wha sweers by Heeven, sweers by Godʼs thron, and by Him wha sits tharon.
23“Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye tithe mint, and dill, and cummin; and pit awa the wechtier things oʼ the Law, justice, mercie and faith. Thir ye behoved to do — no leavin the ither undune.

25“Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders; for ye dicht the ootside oʼ the cup and the dish, but within they are fuʼ oʼ reivin and riot!
26“O blinʼ Pharisee! mak clean first the inside oʼ the cup and the dish, that the ootside oʼt may be made clean as weel!
27“Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye are like whited tombs, whilk look bonnie outside, but within are fuʼ oʼ deid menʼs banes, and aʼ uncleanness.
28“Eʼen sae, ye hae the ootward seemin oʼ being holie men, but within ye are fuʼ oʼ fauseness and sin.
29“Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye bigg the tombs oʼ the Prophets, and busk the graffs oʼ the gude.

33“Serpents! offspring oʼ vipers! hoo are ye to escape the judgment oʼ hell?
34“Tharfor, see! I send ye Prophets, and Wyss Men, and Scribes: some oʼ them wull ye slay and crucify, and some clour iʼ yere kirks, and persecute them frae toon tae toon:
35“That on ye may faʼ aʼ the holie blude shed on the earth, frae the blude oʼ Abel the richtous, to the blude of Zechariah, son oʼ Barachiah, that ye slew atween the Temple and the altar.
36“Truly say I tʼye, aʼ thir things sal come on this race!
37“Eh, Jerusalem! Jerusalem! wha slays the prophets and stanes the messengers sent to her! Hoo aft and fain would I hae gaitherʼt thy bairns thegither, like as a hen gaithers her cleckin aneath her wings! — and ye wadna.

Behaulding Jerusalem; and tellin oʼ her pyne.
1And Jesus gaed oot frae the Temple, and was gangin his ways; and his disciples cam to airt him to look at the biggins oʼ the Temple.
2But he answerʼt tae them, “See‐ye‐na thae things? Truly say I tʼye, thar sal‐na remain here ae stane on anither that sanna be cuisten doon!”
3And as he sat on the Mount oʼ Olives, his disciples cam till him by theirsels, and quoʼ they, “Tell us whan div thae things come? And what is the sign oʼ thy comin? and oʼ the hinner‐end oʼ the warld?”
4And Jesus answerʼt and quoʼ he, “Tak tent that nae man mistryst ye!
5“For mony sal come in my name, sayin, ‘I am the Anointit Ane!’ and sal lead mony a‐gley.
6“And ye sal hear oʼ weir, and aʼ the clash oʼ weir; but be‐na fleyt; for aʼ thae things maun come, but the end oʼ aʼ isna yet.

14“And thir Gude‐tidins oʼ the Kingdom sal be preached in aʼ the warld for a testimonie to the nations; and then sal the end come.
15“Whan, than, ye see the abomination that ruins aʼ, spoken oʼ by Daniel the Prophet, staunin iʼ the Holie Place (wha reads, lat him tak tent!)

The ten maidens, the witless and the wyss. The talents. The great day.
1“Than sal the Kingdom oʼ Heeven be like to ten maidens, takin ilk ane her ain crusie, and gaun oot to meet the bridegroom.
2“And fyve oʼ them war unco witless, and fyve war wyss.
3“For the witless took nae ulyie wiʼ them whan they took their crusies;
4“But the wyss took ulyie iʼ their pouries, wiʼ their lamps.
5“Noo, while the bridegroom cam‐na, they aʼ grew sleeperie, and dozed.
6“But at midnicht cam a shout, ‘Hey, the Bridegroom comes! C’way and meet him!’
7“Than raise aʼ thae maidens, and fettled up their crusies.
8“And the witless said to the wyss, ‘Gie us oʼ yere ulyie; for oor lamps are gaun oot.’
9“But the wyss answerʼt, and quoʼ they, ‘Aiblins thar wadna be eneuch for us and you; but raither gang ye to thae that sell, and seek for yersels.’
10“And while they war aff, trokin, the Bridegroom cam; and they that war ready gaed in wiʼ him till the marriage‐feast; and the door was steekit.

12“But he answerʼt, and quoʼ he, ‘Truly say I tʼye, I dinna ken ye!’
13“Sae, tak ye tent! for ye ken‐na the day nor the ʼoor!
14“For it is juist like a man gaun till anither lanʼ, wha caʼd till him his servants, and gied ower to them his gear.
15“And to ane he gied fyve talents, to anither twa, and anither ane; to ilka ane accordin to his ain ability; and than he gaed on his journey.
16“Than he that had gotten the fyve talents, gaed and trokit and nifferʼt wiʼ the same, and made fyve talents oʼ increase.
17“And likewise the ane oʼ the twa talents, he gained twa mair.
18“But he that gat the ane, gaed awa and howkit iʼ the grunʼ, and hid awa his maisterʼs siller.
19“And, lang eftir, the maister oʼ thae servants comes; and has a reckonin wiʼ them.
20“And he that had gotten the fyve talents gien him, cam and said, ‘My lord! ye gied me five talents; see, I hae gotten fyve talents forby!’
21“His maister says to him, ‘Weel dune, gude and leal servant! ye hae been leal and true ower a wee wheen things; I wull gie ye chairge ower a hantle oʼ things. Enter ye intil the joy oʼ yere lord!’
22“Likewise he oʼ the twa talents cam forrit, and quoʼ he, ‘My lord! ye gied me twa talents; see, I hae gotten twa ither talents!’
23“His lord said, ‘Weel dune, gude and leal servant! Ye hae been leal and true ower a wee wheen things; I wull gie ye chairge ower a hantle oʼ things. Enter ye intil the joy oʼ yere lord!’
24“He, too, wha had gotten the ae talent, cam; and quoʼ he, ‘My lord! I kent ye war a siccar man, shearin whar ye sawʼd‐na, and gaitherin whar ye cuist‐na breid;
25“ ‘And I was fleyʼt, and gaed awa, and hid yere talent iʼ the grunʼ. See! ye hae yere ain!’
26“But his lord answerʼt him, and quoʼ he, ‘Wicked and feckless servant! did ye indeed ken that I shear whaur I saw‐na, and gaither whaur I cast‐na breid?
27“ ‘War ye no behauden than to gie ower my siller to the bankers? and at my hame‐comin I soud hae gotten back my ain, wiʼ interest.

32“And aʼ the nations sal be gaitherʼt afore him; and he wull pairt them ane frae anither, juist as a herd pairts the sheep frae the goats.
33“And he wull pit the sheep on his richt haun, but the goats on the left.
34“Then wull the King say to them on his richt haun, ‘Come ye, aʼ blessed oʼ my Faither! Inherit the Kingdom made ready for ye frae the up‐biggin oʼ the warld!

The sweet perfume oʼ Bethanie. The dool oʼ the garden. Jesus deliverʼt up.
1And sae it cam to pass, that whan Jesus had made an end oʼ thae sayins, he said to his disciples:
2“Ye ken that twa days mair, and the Pasche comes; and the Son oʼ Man is deliverʼt up to be crucifyʼt.”
3Than forgatherʼt the Heid‐priests and the Elders oʼ the nation intil the palace oʼ the Heigh‐priest — the ane caʼd Caiaphas.
4And coonsellʼt thegither that they might tak Jesus hidlins, and slay him.
5“But,” quoʼ they, “no at the Feast‐time; or thar wad be a stramash amang the people.”
6Noo, whan Jesus was in Bethanie, iʼ the hoose oʼ Simon the leper,
7Thar cam till him a wumman wiʼ an alabaster box oʼ unco precious perfume; and she teemed it on his heid as he was at meat.
8And the disciples, seein it, war put aboot, and quoʼ they, “For what is siccan a wastrie?
9“For this micht hae been sellʼt for muckle, and gien to the puir.”
10But Jesus, takin tent, says to them, “Why fash ye the wumman? For a wark that is bonnie has she wrocht on me.
11“For ye aye hae the puir wʼye; but ye hae‐na me aye!
12“For she, strinklin this perfume on my heid, did it for my burial.
13“Truly say I tʼye, whaursoeʼer thir Gude‐tidins sal be made kent iʼ the hail warld, this too oʼ what she has dune sal be tellʼt for a memorial oʼ her.”
14Than ane oʼ the Twal, the ane caʼd Judas Iscariot, gaed awa to the Heid‐priests,
15And quoʼ he tae them, “What meed wull ye gie me, and I wull deliver him up tʼye?” And they trokit wiʼ him for thretty merks.
16And frae that time forrit he watched for a time to betray him.
17Noo on the first oʼ the days oʼ the Sad Breid, the disciples cam to Jesus, askin him, “Whaur wull ye that we wull mak ready for ye to eat the Pasche?”
18And he says, “Gang awa intil the citie, tae sic and sic a man, and speir at him, ‘The Maister says, My time is comin; I keep the Pasche at yere hoose wiʼ my disciples!’ ”
19And the disciples did eʼen as Jesus tellʼt them; and they made ready for the Pasche.
20Noo whan the eʼenin was come, he sat doon at meat wiʼ the Twalʼ.
21And whiles they war eatin, he said, “Truly say I tʼye, that ane oʼ ye wull betray me!”
22And they were unco wae, and begude to say to him, ilk ane oʼ them, “Is it I, Lord?”
23And he said, “He wha dippit his haun wiʼ me in the dish, that ane wull betray me!
24“The Son oʼ Man gangs, as it was written oʼ him; but wae to that man by wham the Son oʼ Man was deliverʼt up! It war gude for yon man gin he nevir had been born!”
25And Judas, wha betrayʼt him, spak, and quoʼ he, “Isʼt I, Maister?” He says till him, “Eʼen as ye say!”
26And as they war eatin, Jesus took the laif, and gied thanks, and brak it, and gied to the disciples, sayin, “Tak, eat; this is my body!”
27And takin a cup, and giean thanks, he gied it to them, sayin, “Drink ye aʼ oʼt!
28“For this is my blude oʼ the New Covenant, whilk is shed for mony, for the pittin‐awa oʼ sins!
29“But I say till ye, I drink nae mair forrit oʼ this frute oʼ the vine, till yon day whan I drink it new wiʼ you iʼ my Faitherʼs Kingdom!”
30And whan they had sung praise, they gaed oot intil the Mount oʼ Olives.
31Than says Jesus till them, “Aʼ ye sal finʼ cause oʼ stumblin in me this nicht; for it is putten‐doon, ‘I wull clour the Shepherd; and the sheep oʼ his hirsel sal be scatterʼt abreid!’
32“But eftir my Risin, I wull gang afore ye intil Galilee.”
33Peter answerin, says to him, “Gin aʼ soud stumble in thee, yet nevir wad I stumble!”
34Jesus says to him, “Truly say I tʼye, that this vera nicht, ʼor ever the cock craw, ye sal thrice disown me!”
35Peter threepit to him, “Gin I soud dee wiʼ thee, yet wull I no disown thee!” And siclike said aʼ the disciples.
36Than cam Jesus wiʼ them intil a place caʼd Gethsemanie; and says to the disciples, “Sit ye here, till I gang yonner and pray.”
37And takin wiʼ him Peter and Zebedeeʼs twa sons, he grew unco fuʼ oʼ sorrow, and sair putten‐aboot.
38Than says he to them, “My saul is unco sorrowfuʼ, eʼen to death! Bide ye here, and watch wiʼ me!”
39And he gaed on a wee bit yont, and fell on his face, and prayed, sayin, “O my Faither! gin it be possible, lat this cup pass by me! yet, no as I wull, but as Thou wult!”
40And he comes till the disciples, and finʼs them sleepin; and quoʼ he to Peter, “Eʼen sae! Coud‐ye‐na watch wiʼ me ae ʼoor?
41“Tak ye tent, and pray, gin ye faʼ‐na intil temptation! The spirit is indeed wullin, but the flesh is waff!”
42Again a second time he gaed aff, and prayed, sayin, “O my Faither! gin this canna gang by me unless I drink it, Thy wull be dune!”
43And, comin again, he faund them sleepin; for their een had wan heavisome.
44And he left them again, and gaed awa, and prayed a third time, sayin the same words.
45And he comes till his disciples; and says he tae them, “Sleepin are ye noo, and takin yere rest? Tent ye! the ʼoor is at haun; and the Son oʼ Man is deliverʼt intil the hauns oʼ evil men!
46“Rise ye, and lat us be gaun! See, he is at haun wha betrays me!”
47And eʼen while he yet spak, look! Judas, ane oʼ the Twalʼ, cam, and wiʼ him a great thrang, wiʼ swords, and rungs, frae the Heid‐priests, and elders oʼ the nation.
48And he wha betrayed him, had gien them a sign, and quoʼ he, “Wha I sall kiss, that same is he; grip him!”
49And at ance he cam to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Maister!” wiʼ unco kissin.
50And Jesus said to him, “Freend, for what did ye come?” Than cam they, and pat their hauns on Jesus, and grippit him.
51And see! ane oʼ them that war wiʼ Jesus, raxʼt oot his haun, and drew a sword, and strack a servant oʼ the Heigh‐priest, and sned aff his lug.
52Than said Jesus to him, “Pit up yere blade intil its place; for aʼ they wha tak oot the sword, by the sword sal dee!
53“Think‐ye‐na that I coud pray my Faither, and he soud send me mair nor twalʼ legions oʼ Angels?
54“But hoo than coud the Scripturs be fulfilled that sae it soud be?”
55In that ʼoor said Jesus to the thrang, “Cam ye oot as again a robber, wiʼ swords and rungs to tak me? I sat day by day, teachin in the Temple, and ye grippit‐me‐na.”
56But aʼ this was dune, that the writins oʼ the Prophets soud come to pass. Than aʼ his disciples desertit him, and fled.
57And they wha had taen Jesus led him awa till Caiaphas, the Heigh‐priest, whaur the Scribes and the Elders war forgatherʼt.
58But Peter followʼt far ahint, to the Heigh‐priestʼs palace; and gaed in, and sat wiʼ the servants, to see the end.
59Noo the Heid‐priests and the hail Cooncil socht fause witnesses again Jesus, that they micht pit him to deid;
60But faund‐them‐na, thoʼ a hantle cam forrit as witnesses. At last cam twa,
61And said, “This Ane said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple oʼ God, and up‐bigg it in thrie days!’ ”
62And the Heigh‐priest raise, and quoʼ he, “Answer‐ye‐na! What isʼt that thir are witnessin again ye?”
63But Jesus was silent. And the Heigh‐priest said, “I adjure ye by the Leevin God, that ye tell us gin ye be The Anointit, the Son oʼ God?”
64Jesus says to him, “Ye hae said it! Natheless, I say tʼye, here‐eftir sal ye see the Son oʼ Man seatit at the richt haun oʼ pooer, and cominʼ iʼ the cluds oʼ Heeven!”
65Than did the Heigh‐priest rive his garments, and quoʼ he, “He has spoken profanely! What need hae we oʼ mair witnesses? Tent ye! ye hae noo heard his profane speech!
66“Hoo dis it seem to ye?” They answerʼt and said, “He is wordie oʼ death!”
67Than they spat in his face, and baffʼt him; and ithers strack him wiʼ the loof,
68Sayin, “Prophesie tae us, thou Anointit Ane! Wha wasʼt that clourʼd thee?”
69Noo, Peter was sittin oot‐by iʼ the coort‐yaird: and a maid cam till him, sayin, “Ye war wiʼ Jesus oʼ Galilee!”
70But he denyʼt fornent them aʼ; threepin, “I ken‐na what yeʼre sayin!”
71And whan he was gane oot intil the porch, anither lassie saw him, and says to them that war thar, “This ane, too, was wiʼ Jesus, the Nazarene!”
72And again he denyʼt wiʼ an aith, “I ken‐na the man!”
73And eftir a wee, they that stude by cam and said to Peter, “Oʼ a sooth ye are ane oʼ them; for yere tongue tells on ye!”
74Than begude he to curse and ban, “I ken‐na the man!” And at ance the cock crew.
75And Peter caʼd to mind the word Jesus spak, “Afore the cock craw, ye wull thrice disown me!” And he gaed oot, and grat sair.

Afore the Governor. At the cross. In the tomb.
1Whan mornin was come, aʼ the Heid‐priests and Elders oʼ the nation coonsellʼt thegither again Jesus to compass his death.
2And they bund him, and led him awa to Pilate the Governor.
3Than Judas, that betrayʼt him, whan he saw he was condemned, repentit sair, and took back the thretty merks to the Heid‐priests and Elders,
4Sayin, “I hae sinned, in deliverin up innocent blude!” But quoʼ they, “What isʼt to us? See ye tillʼt yersel!”
5And he cuist doon the siller iʼ the Temple, and gaed awa; and gangin oot, he hangʼt himsel.
6And the Heid‐priests liftit the siller, and said, “It isna fit to gang iʼ the Treasury, seein it is the price oʼ blude!”
7And, takin advice onʼt, they coft wiʼt the pottersʼ‐grund, to bury fremd anes in.
8Sae that grund was caʼd “The Bluidy Field,” to this day.
9Than cam to pass what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, “And they took the thretty merks, the price oʼ him that had a price set on him, wha was priced amang Israʼlʼs sons;
10“And gied them for the potterʼs yaird; as the Lord appointit me.”
11And Jesus stude fornent the Governor. And the Governor speirʼt at him, “Are ye the King oʼ the Jews?” And Jesus said to him, “Ye hae said it.”
12And bein accused oʼ the Heid‐priests and Elders, he answert nocht.
13Than said Pilate to him, “Hear‐ye‐na hoo mony things they threep again ye?”
14And he answerʼt him no sae muckle as a word; sae that the Governor ferlied uncolie.
15Noo, aye at the Feast, the Governor had lowsed to them ae prisoner, sic ane as they wad.
16And they had, at that time, a noted prisoner, caʼd Barabbas.
17Sae when they had forgatherʼt, Pilate speirʼt at them, “Wham wad ye that I lowse? Barabbas, or Jesus that is caʼd Christ?”
18For he kent that for mere ill‐will they had deliverʼt him up.
19And as he was on the Judgment‐seat, his wife sent till him, sayin, “Hae ye nocht to do wiʼ yon just man! for I hae dreeʼt mony things this day in a dream, on his accoont.”
20Noo the Heid‐priests and the Elders perswadit aʼ the folk that they soud ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
21And the Governor said to them, “Whilk wull ye, oʼ the twa, that I soud release ye?” Quoʼ they, “Barabbas!”
22Pilate says to them, “Than what sal I do wiʼ Jesus, wha is caʼd Christ?” They aʼ say, “Lat him be crucifyʼt!”
23And he said, “Why sae? What ill has he dune?” But they cryʼt oot fierce and lang, “Lat him be crucifyʼt!”
24Sae Pilate, seein he prevailʼt‐na, but that raither a tulzie was risin, had watir, and weshʼt his hauns afore aʼ the folk, sayin, “I am innocent oʼ the blude oʼ this richtous man! See ye tillʼt!”
25And aʼ the folk answerʼt, “His blude be on us, and on oor bairns!”
26Than lowsed he Barabbas; but Jesus he lashʼt, and deliverʼt him to be crucifyʼt.
27Than the sodgers oʼ the Governor, takin Jesus wiʼ them intil the Judgment‐haʼ, gaitherʼt thegither the hail core:
28And they strippit him, and pat on him a scarlet manteel.
29And they wove a croon oʼ thorns, and pat it on his heid, and a reed in his richt haun; and they loutit doon afore him, and geckʼt at him, sayin, “Hail, King oʼ the Jews!”
30And they spat upon him, and baffʼt him ower the heid wiʼ the reed.
31And whan they had mockʼt him, they took aff the manteel frae him, and pat on his ain cleedin, and led him awa to be crucifyʼt.
32And, comin oot, they lichtit on a man oʼ Cyrene, caʼd Simon; him they pressʼd, to cairry the cross.
33And whan they war come till a place caʼd Golgotha, that is to say, “Skull‐place,”
34They offerʼt him wine wiʼ gaʼ inʼt; and whan he had preeʼd, he wadna drink.
35And whan they had crucifyʼt him, they pairtit his cleedin amang theirsels, castin the lot;
36And they sat doon and watchʼt him thar:
37And pat up ower his heid his accusation, “This is Jesus, King oʼ the Jews.”
38Than war twa reivers crucifyʼt wiʼ him, ane on the richt haun, and ane on the left.
39And the passers‐by miscaʼd him, waggin their heids,
40And sayin, “Ye that ding doon the Temple, and up‐bigg it in thrie days, save yersel! Gin ye be Godʼs Son, come doon frae the cross!”
41And eʼen the Heid‐priests too, and the Scribes and Elders, said,
42“Ithers he savʼt: his ain sel he canna save! Israʼlʼs King he is! lat him, eʼen noo, come doon frae the cross, and we wull lippen on him!
43“He lippenʼd on God: lat him, noo, rescue him, gin he cares ocht for him! for he said, ‘I am Godʼs Son!’ ”
44And eʼen the reivers that war crucifyʼt wiʼ him, cuist the same reproach at him.
45Noo, frae the ʼoor oʼ twalʼ, thar was black mirk ower aʼ the kintra, to the ʼoor oʼ thrie.
46And aboot the ʼoor oʼ thrie, Jesus cryʼt oot wiʼ a great voice, sayin, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani!” that is, “My God! My God! for why did Thou forsake me?”
47And some oʼ them staunin thar, said, “He was caʼin for Elijah!”
48And at ance, ane oʼ them ran, and took a sponge, fillin it wiʼ vinegar, and pat it on a reed, and gied him to drink.
49But the lave said, “Haud awa, lat us see gin Elijah comes to rescue him!”
50And Jesus cried oot again wiʼ a great voice, and gied up his spirit.
51And look! The Temple‐veil was riven in twa, frae tap to bottom, and the grund trimmlʼt and the rocks war cleft;
52And the tombs war openʼt; and a hantel oʼ the bodies oʼ the saunts wha had faun asleep, raise;
53And comin oot oʼ their tombs eftir his Risin‐again, they cam intil the holie city, and schawed theirsels to mony.
54And the officer, and they that war watchin Jesus, whan they saw the yirth trimmle, and the things that war dune, war uncolie fleyʼt, sayin, “Truly, this was Godʼs Son!”
55Noo, mony weemen war there, lookin on frae far‐awa, wha had followʼt Jesus frae Galilee, providin for him.
56And amang them, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mither oʼ James and Joses, and the mither oʼ Zebedeeʼs sons.
57And when the gloamin cam on, a rich man frae Arimathea cam, caʼd Joseph; wha himsel was a disciple oʼ Jesus.
58This yin, gaun to Pilate, askit for the body oʼ Jesus. Than Pilate commandit it soud be gien up.
59And Joseph, whan he had taen the body, rowʼt it in a fair linen claith,
60And laid in his ain new tomb, whilk he had howkit oot iʼ the rock, and he rowʼt a great stane tae the door oʼ the tomb; and gaed awa.
61And Mary the Magdalene was thar, and the ither Mary, sittin ower fornent the tomb.
62Noo the neist day — the day eftir the “Preparation” — the Heid‐priests and the Pharisees gaitherʼt thegither to Pilate, sayin to him,
63“Sir, we mind weel that yon deceiver said whan he was yet leevin, ‘Eftir thrie days I wull arise!’
64“Gie commaun, thar‐for, that the tomb be made sure and siccar till the third day; sae that his disciples come‐na and steal him awa, and say to aʼ folk that ‘He is risen frae the deid!’ sae the last deception wad be waur nor the first!”
65Pilate said, “Yeʼse hae a gaird; gang yere ways, and make it as siccar as ye may!”
66Sae they gaed, and made the tomb safe, sealin the stane, and settin a gaird.

Risin frae the deid. The sodgers sic pitifuʼ leears. “Gae preach!”
1And at the hinner‐end oʼ the Sabbath, as it begude to break to the first day oʼ the week, cam Mary the Magdalene, and the ither Mary, to see the tomb.
2And see! a great yirdin! for an Angel oʼ the Lord cam doon frae Heeven, and cam and rowʼt awa the stane and sat onʼt.
3To look at him he was like the fire‐flaught, and his cleedin was white as the snaw;
4And, cuisten‐doon afore him, the gaird did trimmle, and war as deid men.
5But the angel, speaking to the weemen, said, “Be‐na ye fleyʼt! For I ken ye are seekin Jesus, the crucifyʼt.
6“He isna here! for he is risen, eʼen as he said! Come, see the bit whaur the Lord was lyin.
7“And gae quickly, and say ye to his disciples, ‘He is risen frae the deid!’ And mark! he gangs afore ye intil Galilee. Thar sal ye see him. See! I hae tellʼt ye!”
8And quickly leaʼin the tomb, in muckle fear and muckle joy, they ran to tak word to the disciples.
9And look! Jesus met them, and says, “All hail!” And they cam forrit, and grippit him by the feet, and worshippʼt him.
10Than says Jesus to them, “Fear‐na! But gae tell my brethren, sae as they may gang intil Galilee; thar sal they see me!”
11Noo, eʼen while they war gaun, some oʼ the gaird cam intil the citie, and tellʼt to the Heid‐priests aʼ that had been dune.
12And whan they had forgatherʼt wiʼ the Elders, and coonsellʼt thegither, they gied a routh oʼ siller till the sodgers;
13And quoʼ they, “Say ye, ‘His disciples cam in the nicht, and slippit awa wiʼ him whan we war sleepin.’
14“And aiblins gin this come afore the Governor, we wull cajole him, and mak it siccar for you!”
15Sae they liftit the siller, and did as they war tellʼt; and this tale was spread abreid amang the Jews — aye, eʼen to this day.
16And the eleeven disciples gaed awa intil Galilee, to a mountain whaur Jesus had trystit them.
17And, seein him, they adored him; hoobeit, some switherʼt.
18And Jesus, drawin nar, spak to them, sayin, “Thar has been gien to me aʼ pooer in Heeven, and on yirth!
19“Gang ye tharfor, and mak ye disciples oʼ aʼ the nations, bapteezin them intil the name oʼ the Faither, and oʼ the Son, and oʼ the Holie Spirit;
20“Schawin them hoo till observe aʼ things, eʼen as mony as I hae commandit ye. And tent ye! I am wiʼ ye aʼ the days; eʼen till aʼ time!”
