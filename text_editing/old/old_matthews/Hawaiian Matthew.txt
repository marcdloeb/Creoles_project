God give you guys plenny, an he no expeck notting back.

11“Wen you guys go inside one big o small town, look fo one guy dea dat da peopo get respeck fo, an stay his place till you go way from dea. 12Wen you guys go inside da guy house, tell um you dea fo bring aloha. 13An if dat ohana show you guys respeck, den tell dem you like fo God make dem come so notting bodda dem.

Den you guys goin tell wat you know bout me in front dem, an in front da peopos dass not Jew guys. 19Wen dey set you guys up lidat, no worry wat you goin tell o how you goin tell um. Ony tell wat yoa Faddah goin tell you right den an dea. 20Dat time goin be his Spirit stay talk, not you guys.

(Luke 7:18-35; Outa Egypt 23:20; Isaiah 35:5-6; 42:18; 61:1; Malakai 3:1)
2Same time, John Da Baptiza Guy, he stay in prison. He hear bout all da stuff Jesus stay do. (Jesus da Christ Guy, you know, da Spesho Guy God Wen Sen.) So John sen his guys fo talk to Jesus. 3Dey tell him, “Eh, you da guy suppose to come, o wat? O we suppose to wait fo anodda guy fo come?”

But you guys no come sad fo us!’
18“Same ting, wen John Da Baptiza Guy show up, he no eat so he can pray plenny, an he no drink wine. Dass how come peopo tell, ‘Eh, he get one bad kine spirit in charge a him!’ 19But try go figga dis: Me, I da Fo Real Kine Guy. I eat, I drink, an dey tell, ‘You know wat?

Da guy dat get da smarts from God, da tings he do, goin show proof dat he right.”
Da Peopo From Some Towns No Trus Jesus
(Luke 10:13-15; Isaiah 14:13, 15)
20Den Jesus scold da peopo from all da towns wea he wen show his powa, cuz dey not sorry fo all da bad kine stuff dey stay do, an dey still yet stay do um. 21He tell, “Wassamatta you guys?! You guys from Korazin town, an you guys from Betsaida town! I neva show my powa to da Tyre an Sidon guys da way I wen show um to you guys. Az why dem Tyre an Sidon guys neva come sorry fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do, an no even come shame fo all dat. If dey wen see my powa da way you guys wen see um, dey put on burmbag clotheses an throw ash on top dea head fo erybody know dey sorry real quick, but dey neva do dat. But you guys wen see my powa fo real kine, an you still yet no stay sorry! 22But I stay tell you guys now, bumbye goin be mo easy fo da Tyre an Sidon peopo wen dey gotta stan in front God da Judge, den fo you guys.
23 “ ‘An you guys from Capernaum town,

22Dey bring one guy dat get one bad kine spirit dat take ova him. Da guy no can see o talk, cuz da spirit no let um. An Jesus make da spirit no bodda da guy no moa, an make da guy come good fo him talk an see. 23Da peopo, dat blow dea mind, an dey tell, “Eh, dis da guy from King David ohana dat da Bible talk bout befo time, o wat?”
24 Da Pharisee guys hear dat, an dey tell, “Nah! Az Beelzebul, da Devil. He da leada guy fo da bad kine spirits, you know. He da one give dis guy da powa fo make da spirit let da guy go, az why!”
25Jesus know wat dey tink. He tell um, “Da country dat beef each odda, dey ony bus up dea country.

But if you guys no like know all dat stuff, den even da litto bit you know, he goin take um away. 13Dass why me I tell stories fo teach um, cuz jalike da Bible tell,
