5280,HEB,8,SCO1904,for ilka heighpriest is ordeened for the offerin o baith gifts and sacrifeeces and it was necessar for this ane too that he soud hae that whilk he micht offer,and a peal o a buglehorn and a sound o spoken words frae whilk thae wha heard pled notaehearthem ony mair for they couldna thole what was bein laid doon and gin a beas may touch the mountain it maun be staned and sae awesome was that whilk was seen that moses said i am unco fleyd and trimle but ye are come nar till zions mountain and tae the citie o the leevin god a heevenlie jerusalem and till hosts o rejoicin angels and to god the judge o a and to the spirits o richtous anes made perfete and till a mediator o a new covenant jesus and to the strinklin o blude sairpleadin mair than abel tak ye tent that ye rejeckna him that speaks for gin they escaptna wha rejeckit him wha on yirth was warnin them hoo muckle less sal we escape gin we turn oorsels awa frae him wha warns us frae heeven whase voice did shake the yirth but noo has he said yet ance mair i wull shake no the yirth alane but heeven as weel and this ance mair points to the takin awa o thae things that can be shucken as o things that hae been formed that thae may remain that canna be shucken,1,HEB.8
5281,HEB,8,SCO1904,gin than the lord had been on yirth he hadna been a priest ava sin thar are thae offering the gifts conform to the law,and a the folk hearin he said to his disciples haud awa frae the writers wha are fain to gang aboot in lang manteels and loe compliments i the merkits and the boonmaist seats i the kirks and reserved places at feasts wha devoor weedows hooses and to blin the een mak lang prayers thir sal hae a greater malediction,1,HEB.8

5284,HEB,8,SCO1904,for gin the first had been perfete nae need wad thar hae been for a second,but gin the message o death inscrivit in stane cam amid glorie sae that the children o isral warna fu able to look intil moses face for the glorie o his face whilk glorie was to come till an end hoo soudna raither the message o the spirit be in glorie for gin the message o condemnation was in glorie muckle mair the message o richtousness is fu o glorie,1,HEB.8
5285,HEB,8,SCO1904,for as wytin them he says tak tent the days come says the lord that i wull mak wi the hoose o isral and the hoose o judah a new covenant,no conform to the covenant i made wi their forbears i the day i took them by the haun to lead them oot o the land o egypt for it was that they badena i my covenant and i disregairdit them says the lord,0,HEB.8
