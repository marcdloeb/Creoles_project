935,MRK,6,SCO1904,and they that did eat the bannocks war aboot fyve thoosand men,i faund naething wordie o death in him wi a chastisement tharfor i wull release him but they war yammerin wi lood voices demandin to hae him crucifyt,1
936,MRK,6,SCO1904,and noo he wad hae his disciples to gang intil the boat and gang ower to the other side by bethsaida while he skailt the thrang,or did i do wrang in loutin doon mysel that ye micht be heizt up in giean to ye the gudeword for nocht,1
937,MRK,6,SCO1904,and eftir he had pairtit wi the thrang he gaed up intil the mountain to pray,giean thanks to the faither wha gars us to be fit to partak o the inheritance o the saunts in licht wha delivert us oot o the pooer o the mirkness and translatit us intil the kingdom o the son o his love,1
938,MRK,6,SCO1904,and whan the eenin cam on the boat was in the mids o the loch and he alane on the lan,i was aye teachin i the kirk and i the temple whaur a the folk aye gang and hidlins i hae said naething,1
939,MRK,6,SCO1904,and seein them sair forfochten wi the rowin for the win was contrar aboot the hinmaist watch o the nicht he cam till them walkin on the loch and seemed to gang by them,and bein let gang they cam to their ain folk and gaed ower a that the heighpriests and the elders had said,1
940,MRK,6,SCO1904,but they seein him walkin on the loch thocht it had been a ghaist and cryt oot,noo the god o a tholin and consolation gie ye to tak tent to the same thing ane wi anither accordin to jesus christ,1
941,MRK,6,SCO1904,for they a saw him and war sair puttenaboot,and it was gien to him to mak war wi the saunts and to owercome them,1
942,MRK,6,SCO1904,but he begude to speak to them and says to them cheerup bena fleyt and he cam up to them intil the boat and the win gaed doon,and frae thar we pat oot to sea and sailed to the lee o cyprus for that the win was contrar,1
943,MRK,6,SCO1904,and they war sair amazed ayont a measur and ferlied,for esaiah says lord wha lippens what we proclaim,1
944,MRK,6,SCO1904,for they couldna comprehend aboot the bannocks for their heart was turned hard,and the officer says to philip i pray ye wham speaks the prophet o,1
945,MRK,6,SCO1904,and gangin ower they cam to the lan o gennesaret and tyt up at the shore,and takin tent that some o his disciples war eatin breid wi unpurifyt that is unweshen hauns they challenged them,1
946,MRK,6,SCO1904,and whan they war come oot o the boat he was kent at ance,haein than completit this and haein made siccar to them this frute i wull come back by you to spain,1
947,MRK,6,SCO1904,and they ran through a tharawa roond aboot and begude to cairry aboot on their pallets them that war sick whaureer they heard he was,gin yere enemy hunger feed him gin he be drouthie gie him drink for sae doin ye sal heap coals o fire on his heid,1
948,MRK,6,SCO1904,and ilka place he gaed till intil wee touns or cities or a wheen hooses thegither they lay doon the sick i the merkitplaces and besocht him that aiblins they micht touch but the vera fringe o his mantle and as mony as touched war made hale,for what the flesh prefers is at enmity wi god seein it disna gie itsel ower to gods law nor in fact can it sae dae,1
949,MRK,7,SCO1904,and thar are gathert aboot him the pharisees and the scribes that had come doon frae jerusalem,and i saw the seeven angels wha staun i the presence o god and thar war giean to them seeven buglehorns,1
950,MRK,7,SCO1904,and takin tent that some o his disciples war eatin breid wi unpurifyt that is unweshen hauns they challenged them,and he sent oot rinners to gang afore him and as they gaed they cam intil a wee toun o the samaritans to mak ready for his comin,1
951,MRK,7,SCO1904,for the pharisees and a the jews gin they weshna their hauns religiously eatna haudin fast the traditions o the elders,gin hoobeit a had been ae member whaur the body,1
952,MRK,7,SCO1904,and comin frae the merkit gin they weshna their sels they eatna,for gif bein faes we war reconcilt to god throwe his sons death hoo muckle mair bein noo reconcilt sal we be savt in his life,1
953,MRK,7,SCO1904,and mony mair things are thar that they hae acceptit to haud purifyin o cups and stowps coppers and tablecouches,sae the men sat a doon aboot fyve thoosand o them,1
954,MRK,7,SCO1904,and the pharisees and the scribes speir at him hoo ist thy disciples gangna conform to the tradition o the elders but eat their breid wi unpurifyt hauns,for oor consolation is the witness o conscience that in purity and aefauldness afore god no in wisdom o man but by gods favor we sae leeved i the warld and mair owerflowin toward you,1
955,MRK,7,SCO1904,but he said weel did esaiah prophesie o you dissemblers as it is putten doon this nation honor me wi their lips but their heart they haud faurawa frae me but they offer devotion to me in vain teachin as precepts the commandments o men,and on the morn we pat into sidon and julius courteouslie treatin paul gied him liberty to gang to his freends and be enterteend,1
956,MRK,7,SCO1904,for haein putawa gods commaun ye haud fast the tradition o men purifyin o cups and stowps and mony siclike things ye do,for baith jews for ferlies are speirin and greeks for wisdom are seekin whauras we proclaim a messiah wha has been crucifyt to the jews indeed a stumblinclog but to the greeks folly nanetheless to the bidden anes theirsels baith jews and greeks a messiah the pooer o god and the wisdom o god,1
957,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he said to them fu weel ye reject the commaun o god that ye may haud yer ain tradition,aye i coud wiss to be wi ye enoo and to change my speech for i am in a swither aboot ye,1
958,MRK,7,SCO1904,for moses said honor yere faither and yere mither and wha sal revile faither and mither by death lat him dee,nae man comes intil the hald o a michty man to harrie his gudes and gear till he has first bunddoon the strang ane and than wull he harrie his hoose,1
959,MRK,7,SCO1904,but ye say gin a man sal say to his faither or his mither whatsoeer ye micht hae frae me is corban that is dedicate to god ye nae mair suffer him to do aucht for his faither or his mither makin void gods word by yere tradition ye hae delivert and mony sic things ye do,and a the thrang listened to him gladly,1
960,MRK,7,SCO1904,and cain to him the thrang o folk again he says to them hear me every ane o ye and understaun thar is naething frae withoot a man enterin intil him can fyle him but the things that gae forth oot o the man they fyle him,the tenderlove o the lord jesus christ be wi yere spirit,1
961,MRK,7,SCO1904,gin ony ane has hearin to hear lat him tak tent and whan he was come intil the hoose frae the thrang his disciples speirt at him anent the parable,but ye lichtlie the puir ane,1
962,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he says to them are even you wantin discernment,and he said to them the kings o the nations hae rule ower their folk and thae that hae pooer ower them are cad benefactors but it isna sae wi you but he that is the greatest amang ye lat him be as a younger ane and he that rules as gin he sert,1
963,MRK,7,SCO1904,can ye no see that whatsoeer frae withoot that comes intil the man canna fyle him,i gie ye praise that in a things ye hae mind o me and een as i gied to ye the precepts ye are haudin them siccar,1
964,MRK,7,SCO1904,for it comesna ben intil his heart but only to his stammack and gaes intil the sewer purifyin a meat,than the spirit says to philip gang nar and join in wi this chariot,1
965,MRK,7,SCO1904,this he said moreover what comes forth oot o the man that fyles the man for frae within frae ben i the hearts o men ill designs come forth lecherie thefts murders adulteries covetins knaveries deceit wantonness envy evilspeakin loftiness foolishness a thir ill things proceed frae within and they fyle the man and frae thar he raise and gaed intil the borders o tyre and sidon,but wantin faith it isna possible to be weelpleasin to him for he that comes to god maun needs hae faith that he is and that to thae that seek him a rewarder is he,1
966,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he entert intil a hoose and wad hae nae man ken but he coudna be keepit private,but while they ilka ane ferlied at a the things that jesus had dune he says to his followers lat thir words sink doon intil yere lugs for the son o man is sune to be delivert intil the hauns o men but they kentna this sayin and it was keepit frae them that they soudna ken it and they war feart to speir at him anent the sayin,1
967,MRK,7,SCO1904,but forthwith a wumman whase wee dochter had a foul spirit hearin aboot him cam and fell doun at his feet,and frae this on ill no say muckle to ye for this warlds prince comes but has nae haud o me but i speak that the warld may come to ken that i loe the faither and as the faither commandit een sae i dae,1
968,MRK,7,SCO1904,the wumman was a greek a canaanite by blude and she besocht him that he wad cast the demon oot o her dochter,and richtous lot sair vext wi the wanton lives o the wicked he delivert for wi seein and hearin that richtous ane dwallin among them was distressin his richtous saul wi their lawless deeds,1
969,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he said to her the bairn soud first be satisfeet it isna bonnie to tak the bairns breid and cast it to the dowgs,for o a truth they war gaithert in this citie again thy holy ane jesus that thou did anoint baith herod and pontius pilate wi gentiles and folk o isral to do what thy haun and thy mind had markitoot aforehaun to come to pass,1
970,MRK,7,SCO1904,but she answert and said to him een sae lord yet the wee dowgs aneath the table eat o the mools o the bairns,but they geckt at it and gaed their gate ane to his ain mailin and anither to his wares,1
971,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he said to her for that word gang yere ways the demon has gane forth oot o yere dochter,the ane wha gaed doon is the ane wha gaed up far aboon the heevens that he micht hae a things,1
972,MRK,7,SCO1904,and gaun awa to her hoose she faund the bairn lyin on the couch and the demon gane forth,but gin ony ane is ignorant anent this lat him bide ignorant,1
973,MRK,7,SCO1904,and again gaun forth oot o the pairts o tyre he cam throwe sidon to the loch o galilee up throwe the pairts o the ten cities,for he wha is wantin i thir things is bleart seeinna farawa haein forgotten the purifyin o his auld sins,1
974,MRK,7,SCO1904,and they bring to him ane that can hear nane and speak but a wee and they beg that he wad lay his haun on him,and the peace o god that is aboon a oor thocht sal keep yere hearts and yere thochts in christ jesus,1
975,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he led him aside frae the thrang and pat his fingers intil his lugs and touched his tongue wi spittle and lookin up to heeven he gied a sigh and said ephphatha that is be thou unbarred and his lugs war unsteekit and the string o his tongue was lowsed and he spak plain,and the faither kens me and i ken the faither and i gie my ain life for the sheep,1
976,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he instruckit them that they soud tell nane but accordin as he instruckit them sae muckle the mair did they tell ot and they were astonisht ayont a bounds sayin he has done a things weel he gars een the deif to hear and the dumb to speak,whan i was a bairn i spak like a bairn i esteemed things like a bairn i thocht like a bairn but noo bein a man i hae puttenawa bairnlike things,1
977,MRK,8,SCO1904,in thae days whan again there was a great thrang and they had naething to eat jesus cad his disciples and said to them i hae pitie on the folk for they hae been wi me now thrie days and haena to eat,and i the kirk was a man wi a foul spirit and he cryt oot wi a great voice sayin lat us be what is thar atween us and thee jesus o nazareth,1
978,MRK,8,SCO1904,and gin i send them hungerin awa to their hames they wull swarf by the way for a hantle o them come frae far awa,noo this gaed on for twa year sae that a folk dwallin i the province o asia heard the lords word jews and greeks,1
979,MRK,8,SCO1904,and his disciples answert him in whatna gate coud we be able to fill thir men wi bannocks here in a wilderness,but mony o thae that heard the word believed and the number o the men cam to be aboot fyve thoosand,1
980,MRK,8,SCO1904,and he speirt at them hoo mony bannocks hae ye,see the feet o them that hae buryt yere gudeman are at the door and sal cairry ye oot and she fell juist doon at his feet and deet and the young men cam in and faund her deid and bure her oot and buryt her by her gudeman,1
981,MRK,8,SCO1904,and he commandit the thrang to lout doon on the grun and takin the seeven bannocks and giean thanks he brak and gied to his disciples to set afore them and they set afore the thrang,but we ken that the judgment o god is true on thae practeesin sic things as thir,1
982,MRK,8,SCO1904,and they had a wheen sma speldrins and he blesst and had them set them on as weel,and it cam aboot as i gaed on and cam nar to damascus aboot noon on a suddaintie oot o the lift cam an unco licht a aboot me,1
983,MRK,8,SCO1904,and they did eat and war satisfyt and they took up o the broken bits ower seeven creelsfu,wha plants a vineyaird and eatsna o the frute,1
984,MRK,8,SCO1904,noo they that war eatin war aboot fowr thoosan and he sent them awa,than paul said to him god sal clour you ye whitit wa for sit ye thar to judge me by the law and gar clour me contrar to the law,1
985,MRK,8,SCO1904,and withoot delay gaun intil a boat wi his disciples he cam intil the kintraside o dalmanutha,haewena richt to be leadin aboot a wife wha is a believer as weel as the lave o the apostles and the lords brethren and peter,1
986,MRK,8,SCO1904,and oot cam the pharisees and begude to argue wi him seekin frae him some token frae heeven tempin him,but whansoever the frute wad gie itsel up he pits in the heuk for that the hairst has come,1
987,MRK,8,SCO1904,and deeply maenin in his saul he says why soud this generation ask a token,than paul said to him god sal clour you ye whitit wa for sit ye thar to judge me by the law and gar clour me contrar to the law,1
988,MRK,8,SCO1904,truly say i tye nae token sal be gien till this generation and he left them and again launchin oot cam to the ither side,but peter followt far ahint to the heighpriests palace and gaed in and sat wi the servants to see the end,1
989,MRK,8,SCO1904,and they forgat to tak laives nor had they i the boat wi them mair nor ae bannock,and belyve i was i the spirit and lo a thron was set in heeven and on the thron ane sittin and he that was sittin was like to a jasper stane and a cornelian and a rainbow was aboot the thron to look on like an emerant,1
990,MRK,8,SCO1904,and he warned them tak tent beware o the barm o the pharisees and the barm o herod and they war coonsellin amang theirsels we hae brocht nae laives and jesus takin tent says to them why soud ye be quaistenin thegither for that ye hae nae laives dae ye no yet see nor understaun,and they sal hunger nae mair and gang drouthie nae mair nor sal the sun smite them nor ony heatblast,1
991,MRK,8,SCO1904,hae ye yere heart hardened yet,and look the templeveil was riven in twa frae tap to bottom and the grund trimmlt and the rocks war cleft and the tombs war opent and a hantel o the bodies o the saunts wha had faun asleep raise and comin oot o their tombs eftir his risinagain they cam intil the holie city and schawed theirsels to mony,1

2133,JHN,2,SCO1904,and syne he gaed doon to capernaum wi his mither and his ain folk and the disciples and they stoppit thar a wheen days,and no this alane but een rejoice in oor troubles kennin that troubles work oot langtholin and langtholin testin and testin hope and hope maksna ashamed for that gods love has been shed abreid in oor hearts throwe the holie spirit gien to us,1
2134,JHN,2,SCO1904,and the jewish pasche was narhaun and jesus syne gaed up to jerusalem,ilk ane that dis sin brecks ower the law for sin is a breckin ower the law and ye are aware that he was made kent that he micht tak awa oor sins and in him sin isna nae ane bidin in him sins nae ane sinnin has seen him nor comprehendit him,1
2135,JHN,2,SCO1904,and thar i the temple he cam on the trokers o nowte and sheep and doos and the nifferers o siller sittin,geckna at preachins but pit a things to the test and what is bonnie haud fast,1

2138,JHN,2,SCO1904,jesus said till them mak an end o this temple and in thrie days ill restore it than cryt the jews sax and forty year gaed by afore this temple was a biggit and are ye gaun to bigg it in thrie days,i am the gude shepherd the gude shepherd gies his ain life for his sheep,1
2139,JHN,2,SCO1904,but it was the holie temple o his ain body he spak o,and he spak till them dip oot noo and tak to the maister o the feast and they gaed wit,1
2140,JHN,2,SCO1904,and sae belyve when he was risen frae the deid the disciples cad to mind that he had said this to them and they lippened the word and a that jesus said,than the disciples o john cam till him and quo they hoo ist that we fast muckle and the pharisees but yere disciples haena to fast,1
2141,JHN,2,SCO1904,and whan he was at the pasche in jerusalem as the feast gaed on mony begude to believe on his name whan they saw the ferlies dune aneath his haun,i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the forefront and the endin,1
2142,JHN,2,SCO1904,but jesus didna lippen and gie his sel ower to them for he kent men and needitna that ony soud tell him aboot a man for he kent a that was in man,the law and the prophets war till john cam frae that time on the kingdom o god is made plain and a men are thrangin intilt,1
2143,JHN,3,SCO1904,thar was ane o the pharisees by name nicodemus and in authoritie amang the jews,and forby we entreat ye brethren and coonsel ye i the lord jesus that een as ye had frae us hoo ye soud be walkin and pleasin god een as ye are walkin that ye abound yet mair and mair,1
2144,JHN,3,SCO1904,and he cam i the mirk o the nicht to jesus and quo he maister we a ken ye are a teacher frae god for nane could do sic wunnerworks as ye do gin god warna wi him jesus said to him truly say i tye gin a man bena born again his een sal never see gods kingdom quo nicodemus but hoos a man to be born in eild,gude favor be wi ye a,1
2145,JHN,3,SCO1904,maun he return till his mithers womb and be born ower again,and this is the freedom o speech that we hae toward him that gin onything we be askin conform to his wull he hearkens to us,1
2146,JHN,3,SCO1904,but jesus spak truly truly say i tye gin a man bena watirborn and spiritborn hese no come intil gods kingdom and aye that whilk is born o the flesh is itsel flesh and that whilk is born o the spirit is spirit,een though i mysel micht lay some stress een on things o the flesh,1
2147,JHN,3,SCO1904,mak nae ferlie o my words ye maun be born again the wind blaws whaur it wull and ye hear the sough ot but canna ken whaur it comes frae nor whaur it gangs tae sae is it wi ane born o the spirit,he wha taks in a seer in the name o a seer sal receive a seers reward and he wha taks in a holie man i the name o a holie man wins a holie mans reward,1
2148,JHN,3,SCO1904,nicodemus says to him hoo can siccan a thing be,sae than ye are nae mair fremdfolk and gangrels but are marrows o the saunts and are o the hoosehauld o god,1
2149,JHN,3,SCO1904,quo jesus to him can ye be a maister o isral and kenna thir things,or did i do wrang in loutin doon mysel that ye micht be heizt up in giean to ye the gudeword for nocht,1
2150,JHN,3,SCO1904,truly truly say i tye we speak what we ken and bear witness o oor ain een and ye winna hear us,or dae ye licthlie the unco kindness and forbearin and langtholin o god no takin tent that gods gudeness wad fain lead ye to repentance,1
2151,JHN,3,SCO1904,gin i hae tauld ye things o the yirth and ye winna hae them wull ye lippen my word anent things o heeven,than to jerusalem they returned frae the mount olivet whilk is narhaun jerusalem a sabbathdays journey aff,1
2152,JHN,3,SCO1904,and nae man has eer gane up aboon but he that cam doon frae aboon the son o man wha bides aboon,i hae keepit for mysel seeven thoosand men wha haena loutit a knee to baal sae than een at this present thar is a wee wheen left by way o a favorin choice,1
2153,JHN,3,SCO1904,and like as moses i the wilderness heized up the serpent sae maun the son o man be liftit heigh that a wha lippen till him soudna dee but hae life for aye for god sae loved the warld as to gie his son the onlybegotten ane that ilka ane wha lippens till him sudna dee but hae life for aye,for i was blythe whan the brethren cam and bure witness to yere aefauldness een as ye are walkin in aefauldness,1
2154,JHN,3,SCO1904,for god sentna his son intil the warld to bring condemnation ont but that raither the warld micht be saved by him,but the spiritual man speirs oot a things but he his sel is speirt oot by nane,1
2155,JHN,3,SCO1904,and ane that lippens him isna hauden guilty but ane wha winna lippen him is judged guilty een no for he hasna lippened to the son o god the onlybegotten ane,a wark eesweet and bonnie has she dune in me,1
2156,JHN,3,SCO1904,and here is the sentence he drees that licht beams on the warld and men loe the mirk and no the licht for that their deeds are wrang,and wha gied ye this authoritie,1
2157,JHN,3,SCO1904,for ilka ane that follows ill hates the licht and comes na tillt jalousin that his ill deeds wull be seen,than forgathert the heidpriests and the elders o the nation intil the palace o the heighpriest the ane cad caiaphas,1
2158,JHN,3,SCO1904,but the man wha has the truth seeks the licht that a his deeds may be plainly seen that they are dune i the pooer o god,but whansaer a sterker ane than his sel comes on him and owercomes him he taks awa his graithin on whilk he lippened and divides his booty,1
2159,JHN,3,SCO1904,eftir thae things jesus and the disciples cam intil judea and he bade wi them bapteezin,truly truly say i tye he wha comesna ben by the door intil the fauld but speels up by some gate o his ain is but a thief and a reiver,1
2160,JHN,3,SCO1904,and john his sel was in enon narby salim bapteezin for thar was rowth o watir tharaboot and the folk cam to be bapteezt,but jesus said dinna fash her why soud ye pit her aboot,1
2161,JHN,3,SCO1904,for john wasna yet cuisten intil prison,and on the morn takin oot twa sillerpennies he gae them to the guidman sayin tak tent o him weel and whatna mair ye ware on him whan i come back ise pay ye,1
2162,JHN,3,SCO1904,and noo thar cam a quaisten atween johns disciples and a jew anent purification,and comin intil an agony yet mair earnestly he prayed and he swat as it had been mickle draps o blude fain doon to the grun,1
2163,JHN,3,SCO1904,and till john they cam sayin maister the ane that was ayont jordan wi ye the ane ye bure witness till dye ken hes bapteezin and a the folk come till him,while to him wha worksna but lippens him wha justifies the ungodly the faith o him is coontit as richtousness,1
2164,JHN,3,SCO1904,john says to them ane can hae naething gien him gin it be na frae heeven,and no ane amang them but god keeps in mind but the vera hairs o yere heid are a coontit,1
2165,JHN,3,SCO1904,ye mind yersels that i said i am no the messiah but ane sent afore him the ane that has the bride he is the bridegroom but the bridegrooms gude freend staunin by and hearin his word joys i the voice o the bridegroom,but peter and john answerin said gin it be richt for us to list to you mair than to god judge yersels for we canna forbear speakin oot the things we hae seen and heard and whan they had gien them mair warnin they loot them gang no seein hoo they coud punish them on account o the folk for a glorifyt god for what was dune,1
2166,JHN,3,SCO1904,this is my joy fulfilled he maun wax but i maun wane,and i sal gie ferlies i the lift aboon and tokens i the yirth under blude and fireflauchts and blindin reek,1
2167,JHN,3,SCO1904,he that comes frae aboon is aboon a folk he wha is o the yirth is yirthlike and speaks o the yirth but he wha is frae aboon is aboon a,and they cam to the ither side to the pairts o the geresenes,1
2168,JHN,3,SCO1904,and he speaks o the sicht o his ain een and thar isna a man to tak him at his word but ony ane that taks his word he has set his seal to the truth o god and made it his ain,a ye hae dool and sorrow enoo but i wull be wye again and yere heart sal be blythe and yere blytheness nane sal tak awa frae ye,1
2169,JHN,3,SCO1904,for the ane sent frae god speaks gods word for he has sent the spirit ayont a measure,sae fastin and prayin and layin their hauns on them they sent them aff,1
2170,JHN,3,SCO1904,the faither loes his son and gies a things intil his hauns,and wha taksna up his cross to follow me isna wordie o me,1
2171,JHN,3,SCO1904,the man wha lippens on the son has life for aye and he wha winna believe the son sal see life nevir but the ban o god on him sal bide,for i the law o moses it is putten doon ye sanna muzzle the threshin ox,1
2172,JHN,4,SCO1904,noo whan the lord kent the pharisees had word that he gaithert in and bapteezt mair folk than john did but it was the disciples and no jesus sel wha bapteezt he quat the jews kintraside and gaed awa again intil galilee and he behoved to gang athort samaria,but no as the faut was the gift o the favor for gin by the faut o ane mony deet mair was the favor o god and the free gift the favor o the ae man jesus christ was mair sufficin for the mony,1
2173,JHN,4,SCO1904,and he lichtit on a samaria citie cad sychar narhaun the bit grun jaucob gied to joseph,but gif wi the finger o god i am castin oot the demons than incontinent has the kingdom o god come upon ye whansaeer a sterk ane ready for war has ward ower his ain dwallin his gear is safe,1
2174,JHN,4,SCO1904,and jesus forfouchten wi the way cuist his sel doon on the waal and it was aboot the dennertime,but it was the holie temple o his ain body he spak o,1
2175,JHN,4,SCO1904,than thar cam a samariawumman forrit to draw watir,wi freedom christ maks us free staun ye steive than and bena hauden fast wi ony yoke o bondage tak tent i paul say tye that gin ye receive circumceesion christ wull profit ye nocht,1
2176,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo jesus lat me have a sowp o watir his disciples had a gane to the citie for meat quo the samariawumman hoo ist that ye bein a jew are seekin drink frae me a samariawumman,sae than my brethren ye too war brocht to death throwe the body o christ to the end ye micht become anithers his wha was raised frae the deid that we soud bring forth frute to god,1
2177,JHN,4,SCO1904,for the jews hae nae trokin nor neeborliness wi the samariafolk quo jesus gin ye kent gods gift and wha it soud be that said gie me a sowp o watir ye wad hae socht frae him the leevin watir and gottent too said the wumman to him sir ye hae naething to lat doon the waal and the waals unco deep whaur fin ye the leevin watir,far jimply wad ony ane dee for an upricht man yet aiblins for a holie man ane micht een daur death but god commends his ain love to us in that een while we war yet in sin christ deet for us,1
2178,JHN,4,SCO1904,ye canna be greater nor oor forebear jaucob wha gied us the waal and slockened his ain drouth wit and the drouth o his bairns and his beasts,for in him we leeve act and exist as een thae amang yere ain bards hae said for his offspring too are we bein than gods offspring we soudna think that that whilk is divine is like to gowd or siller or stane carved wi skill and device o man,1
2179,JHN,4,SCO1904,jesus said to her wha may drink this watir wull be drouthie syne but wha drinks o the watir i gie him sal be drouthie nevirmair for the watir i gie him sal be in him an unseen waal springin up intil life eternal the wumman cryt oot sir lat me hae this watir no to be drouthie and neer to fash to come to the waal again quo jesus gang awa and ca yere gudeman and come again belyve but the wumman said to him i haena a gudeman quo jesus ye hae dune richt to say ye haena a gudeman for ye hae had fyve and the ane ye hae enoo is no yere ain gudeman ye spak truth thar,and noo o my faither glorify me aboon wi thysel een wi the glorie i bure wi thee afore a warlds i hae schawn forth thy name to the men thou did gie me oot frae the warld they war thine and o thine ain thou did gie me and they hae keepit thy word,1
2180,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo the wumman sir i jalouse ye maun be a prophet oor forebears worshipped i this vera mountain but yere folk say jerusalems the place whaur folk soud worship jesus pat in wumman lippen to me the oors at haun whan naither here nor yet thar sal they worship the faither ye kenna what ye ser but we ken what we worship and salvation comes frae amang the jews,and the twal yetts war twal pearls ilka allenar yett ae pearl and the causey o the citie was gowd like shinin gless,1

2274,JHN,6,SCO1904,than the jews yammert at him for that he said to them i am the breid that cam doon frae heeven,sae haein set a day a hantle o them cam to him at his lodgin and to them he exponed testifyin o the kingdom o god and perswadin them anent jesus baith frae moses and the prophets frae the dawin to the gloamin,1

2276,JHN,6,SCO1904,hoo ist than that he says he cam doon frae heeven,and eftir the thrie days and a hauf a spirit o life frae god enters them and they stude on their feet and muckle fear fell on thae behauldin them,1
2277,JHN,6,SCO1904,sae jesus answert them and quo he cavilna amang yersels,and they cam intil capernaum and withoot delay on the sabbath day he cam intil the kirk and was teachin,1
2278,JHN,6,SCO1904,nae man comes to me gin the faither wha sent me dinna draw him and i wull raise him again at the last day,pit oot intil the deep and lat doon yere nets for a haul,1
2279,JHN,6,SCO1904,the prophets pat doon and god sal teach them a,for the flesh has desires contrar to the spirit and the spirit contrar to the flesh for thir again ane anither are set that ye mayna do the things ye wad itherwise do but gin than ye are led by the spirit ye arena under the law,1
2280,JHN,6,SCO1904,and sae ilk man wha hears and has taen in the lear o the faither comes to me,than sal they gie ye up to dool and sal slay you and ye sal be hatit o a folk for the sake o me,1

2282,JHN,6,SCO1904,but here is the breid that cam doon frae heeven that a man may eat o it and no dee the leevin breid that cam doon frae heeven is mysel gin ony man eat this breid he leeves for aye and the breid i sal gie is my flesh that i wull gie for the warlds life,and he said oor faithers god appointit ye that ye micht ken his wull and see the richtous ane and hear words frae his mooth,1
2283,JHN,6,SCO1904,but the jews had an unco bruilzie anent it amang theirsels and cryt oot hoo can this man gie us his flesh to eat,lat us than draw nar wi freedom o speech to the thron o tenderlove that we may obteen mercie and find favor to help us in oor need,1
2284,JHN,6,SCO1904,than quo jesus to them truly truly say i tye gin ye eatna the flesh o the son o man and drink his blude thar is nae life in ye wha eats my flesh and drinks my blude wins life eternal and him wull i raise again at the last day,and they that heard him slippit cannilie oot frae the auldest een to the last ane and jesus was left alane wi the wumman staunin i the mids,1
2285,JHN,6,SCO1904,for my flesh is vera meat and my blude is vera drink,and eftir thrie months we set sail in a ship that had been winterin i the isle an alexandrian ship wi an ensign the twinbrithers,1
2286,JHN,6,SCO1904,and wha eats my flesh and drinks my blude bides in me and i in him,for he wha said ye maunna commit adultery said as weel ye maunna commit murder,1

2288,JHN,6,SCO1904,but a hantle o his followers whan they heard that said thae things are unco hard wha can bide tae listen till them,a wumman in her bearinpangs has dool for that her oor is on her but as sune as she has borne the bairn she minds nae mair the pang for blytheness that a man is born intil the warld,1
2289,JHN,6,SCO1904,jesus kennin in himsel what his followers war mutterin aboot it says to them are ye angert at this,for the body isna ae member but mony,1
2290,JHN,6,SCO1904,what than gin ye see the son o man gang awa up whaur he was afore,and for this cause i pit ye in mind to steer up gods gift that is in ye throwe the layinon o my hauns,1

2334,JHN,7,SCO1904,i the hinmaist day that great day o the feast jesus stude and cryt oot gin ony man be drouthie lat him een come to me and drink he wha lippens on me as it is putten doon i the scriptur oot frae him sal flow rivers o leevin watir but this spak he o the spirit that they sal see wha lippen on him for the holie spirit wasna yet gien for jesus wasna yet glorifyt,and the disciples doin as jesus appointit them feshd the ass and the cowt and they laid on their mantles and he sat tharon,1
2335,JHN,7,SCO1904,and a hantle o the folk whan they heard a this said surely this maun be the prophet ither wheen this is the messiah but quo some sal the messiah come oot o galilee,they say to him lord come awa and see jesus grat,1
2336,JHN,7,SCO1904,has the scriptur no said oot o the toon o bethlehem whaur dauvid was,hear ye anither parable thar was a laird wha plantit a vineyaird and dykit it roond aboot and howkit a winevat int and biggit a tooer and lat it oot to crofters and gaed awa till anither land,1

2338,JHN,7,SCO1904,and a wheen o them wad fain hae laid haud o him but nae man pat haun on him,and jesus says to them come ye eftir me and ise mak ye fishers o men and at ance leain their nets they followt eftir him,1
2339,JHN,7,SCO1904,than cam the officers back to the heidpriests and pharisees and quo they to them why hae ye no brocht him,but i entreat ye brethren to tak tent o thae that mak the diveesions and offences contrar to the lear ye war learned and turn awa frae them,1
2340,JHN,7,SCO1904,quo the officers neer man spak like this man quo the pharisees to them are ye glamord as weel,but quo jesus to them its no my time yet your time is aye at haun the warld canna hate you but it hates me for i gie testimonie again it that its warks are ill,1

2350,JHN,8,SCO1904,but jesus loutit doon and gaed on writin in the yird wi his finger,and than the disciples cam to jesus a by their sels and quo they why wast we couldna cast him oot,1
2351,JHN,8,SCO1904,sae whan they gaed on askaskin him he straughtit his sel and quo he to them the ane thats wantin sin amang ye lat him cast the first stane at her and ance mair he loutit his sel doon writin on the grun,and lo i send oot the promise o my faither upon ye but bide ye i the citie till ye be cleedit wi pooer frae aboon and he led them oot the lenth o bethanie and haudin up his hauns he blessd them,1
2352,JHN,8,SCO1904,and they that heard him slippit cannilie oot frae the auldest een to the last ane and jesus was left alane wi the wumman staunin i the mids,and thir on the rock are they wha whan they hear wi joy welcome the word but they hae nae rute wha believe for a wee and in time o trial fa away,1
2353,JHN,8,SCO1904,whan jesus straughtit his sel up and saw nane but the wumman he says to her whaur are they that wytit ye,for thar is nae authoritie but by god thae existin exist by god,1

2752,JHN,19,SCO1904,noo thar was putten ont jesus the nazarene the king o the jews,and he says to them my saul is unco wae een till death bide ye here and tak gude tent and he gaed forrit a wee and loutit doon to the grun and prayed that gin it coud be the oor micht pass by him,1
2753,JHN,19,SCO1904,and it was sae that a hantle o the jews read this title for the bit whaur jesus was crucifyt was narhaun the citie and it was written i the hebrew and eke i the latin and greek,settin forth the kingdom o god and exponin the things anent the lord jesus christ wi a freedom o speech nane hinderin him,1
2754,JHN,19,SCO1904,than quo the heighpriests o the jews to pilate dinna write king o the jews but he said im king o the jews pilate answert what i hae written i hae written than the sodgers whan they had crucifyt jesus took his cleedin and made it a intil fowr pairts to ilka ane ane and his inner coat as weel,lat him no become circumceesed circumcession is naething and uncircumceesion is naething but the keepin o gods commandments is athing,1
2755,JHN,19,SCO1904,noo the inner coat was wantin ony seam a wrocht in ae piece frae the tap doon,but they coonsellt thegither by their sels and said gin we sal say frae heeven he wull answer why believedyena in him,1
2756,JHN,19,SCO1904,they said ane till anither lat us no rive it but cast lots fort whase it sal be sae was fulfilled the scriptur that said they pairtit my garments for theirsels and on my cleedin cuist they lots,and ye maisters div ye the like things to them kennin that their maister and yours is in heeven and thar is nae respectin o faces wi him,1
2757,JHN,19,SCO1904,thae vera things the sodgers did,and ane o them whan he saw he was healed cam back wi a lood voice giean glorie to god,1
2758,JHN,19,SCO1904,but staunin by the cross o jesus war his mither and his mithers sister mary she o cleophas and mary o magdala,for mony fauseanes hae gane oot intil the warld they that ownna that jesus christ is come i the flesh,1
2759,JHN,19,SCO1904,sae whan jesus saw his mither and the disciple wham he loed staunin by he says to the mither wumman see yere son again he says to the disciple see yere mither and frae that oor the disciple took her to his ain hoose,than said jesus dinna pit her aboot has she no been hainin it for my buryin day,1
2760,JHN,19,SCO1904,eftir this jesus kennin that a things war noo endit that the scriptur micht be dune said i hae drouth a cog was thar fu o soor wine and they dippit a sponge int and pat it on a wand o hyssop and brocht it to his mou,and gin ony ane taks awa frae the words o the buik o this prophecie god wull tak awa his pairt frae the tree o life and frae the holie citie een frae the things that are puttendoon i this buik,1
2761,JHN,19,SCO1904,whan jesus had gotten the soor wine he cryt it is dune and loutin doon his heid gied up his spirit,but forthwith a wumman whase wee dochter had a foul spirit hearin aboot him cam and fell doun at his feet,1
2762,JHN,19,SCO1904,than the jews seein it was the preparation that the bodies soudna bide on the crosses ower the sabbath for that sabbath was a great day craved pilate to hae their legs broken and they be taen doon,faither i wad mair that they wham thou gies me soud be wi me whaur i bide that they may set een on my glorie whilk thou has gien me for thou loed me or the fundation o the yirth,1
2763,JHN,19,SCO1904,than cam the sodgers and brak the legs o the first and o the ither wha war crucifyt wi him,and i entreatit thy disciples to cast him oot and they coudna and answerin jesus said o fause and thrawart generation to whatna time sal i bide wye,1
2764,JHN,19,SCO1904,but whan they cam to jesus and they coud see he was een noo deid they brakna his legs,na i tell ye but gin ye repentna in siclike mainner sal ye be destroyt,1
2765,JHN,19,SCO1904,but ane o the sodgers wi a spear proddit his side and oot ot cam blude and watir,ist for the owsen god has care,1

2767,JHN,19,SCO1904,for thae things cam aboot that the scriptur soud be fulfillt no a bane o his sal be broken and ance mair anither scriptur they sal look on him they hae pierced and eftir thir things joseph o arimathea himsel a disciple o jesus craved pilate that he micht tak awa jesus body and pilate loot him sae dae,noo it cam aboot in iconium that they gaed intil the jews kirk and sae spak that thar believed baith o jews and greeks an unco thrang,1
2768,JHN,19,SCO1904,syne he cam and took awa the corp,and this is the freedom o speech that we hae toward him that gin onything we be askin conform to his wull he hearkens to us,1
2769,JHN,19,SCO1904,and eke cam nicodemus he wha at the first cam to him by nicht bringin a hantle o myrrh and aloes throweither aboot a hunnerwecht,and they sal hunger nae mair and gang drouthie nae mair nor sal the sun smite them nor ony heatblast,1
2770,JHN,19,SCO1904,sae they took the body o jesus and rowt it i the linen wi the spices as is the mainner o the jews wi the deid,and sae it is weel to do gude on the sabbathday,1
2771,JHN,19,SCO1904,noo at the bit whaur he was crucifyt was a gairden and i the gairden a newmade tomb in whilk man was neer yet laid,whan jesus had come intil the kintraside o philips cesarea he speirt at his disciples wha dae folk say the son o man is,1

3733,ROM,7,SCO1904,sae that on the ae haun the law is perfete and the commandment holie and just and gude,and seein their lealness he says to him man yere sins are forgien ye and the writers and the pharisees begude to dispute wha is this utterin profaneness,1
3734,ROM,7,SCO1904,weel than did the gude become death to me,but sic as thir we chairge and entreat i the lord jesus that quately workin they eat their ain breid,1

3743,ROM,8,SCO1904,sae than thar is nae condemnation for thae that are in christ jesus,than cam the officers back to the heidpriests and pharisees and quo they to them why hae ye no brocht him,1
3744,ROM,8,SCO1904,for the principle o the spirit o life in christ jesus delivert me frae the principle o sin and death,but he answerin says till him maister lat it bide this ae year mair till whatna time i can delve aboot it and dung it,1
3745,ROM,8,SCO1904,for what coudna be by the law in that it was feckless throwe oor flesh god condemned sin i the flesh in sendin his ain son i the image o oor flesh and because o sin,and thar cam up a great tempest o win and the waves war dashin ower intil the boat sae that the boat was fillin,1

3747,ROM,8,SCO1904,for they wha leeve conform to the flesh wad raither hae the things o the flesh but they followin the spirit wad hae the things o the spirit,and whan they heard thae things they war quate and laudit god sayin noo has god gien repentance until life een to the gentiles noo they that war scattert abreid by the persecution that raise anent stephen gaed the length o phenicia and cyprus and antioch speakin the word allenar to the jews,1

3752,ROM,8,SCO1904,but gin christ is in ye the body is deid on accoont o sin but the spirit is leevin on accoont o holiness,for john tellt herod it is no allood for ye to hae the wife o yere brither and sae herodias held a grudge again him and wad hae slain him but she coudna,1
3753,ROM,8,SCO1904,and gin the spirit wha raised up jesus frae amang the deid dwalls in ye he that raised up christ jesus frae amang the deid sal een gie life to yere deein bodies on accoont o his indwallin spirit in ye,and sae faith comes oot o what is heard and hearin comes by the word that is anent christ,1
3754,ROM,8,SCO1904,sae than brethren debtors are we no to the flesh conform to the flesh to leeve for gin conform to the flesh ye are leevin ye are sure to be deein but gin i the spirit ye are slayin the deeds o the body ye sal leeve,he answerin said and wha is he lord,1

3759,ROM,8,SCO1904,for the fainlookitforrit o the creation is waitin for the revealin o gods bairns,and when peter gaed up to jerusalem they oot o the circumceesion war challengin him sayin ye gaed in to men no circumceest and did eat meat wi them but peter beginnin set the maitter in order afore them sayin i was in the citie o joppa prayin and in a dwaum i saw a vision a veschel comin doon as it had been a great sheet by fowr corners loutit doon frae the lift and it cam to me,1
3760,ROM,8,SCO1904,for to vanity was creation made subject no o its ain wull but by him wha made it subject in hope that the creation itsel soud be delivert frae the slavery o corruptness intil the liberty o the glorie o the bairns o god,and than sal he send oot his angels and sal gaither thegither his chosen anes frae the fowr winds frae the ootermaist pairt o the yirth to the ootermaist o heeven,1

4021,1CO,4,SCO1904,for sae it seems to me god has set forth us the apostles hinmaist as gien ower to the deid for a spectacle are we made to the warld to angels and to men,for in christ jesus naither circumceesion is onything nor uncircumceesion but a new creation,1

4393,2CO,3,SCO1904,wha een made us able to be messengers o a new covenant no o letter but o spirit for the letter slays but the spirit maks leevin,sae than i am content in weaknesses in skaithins in necessities in persecutions in stretts on behauf o christ for whan i mysel am weak than am i stieve i hae become glaikit ye hae compelled me for i micht weel hae been commendit by you for i am naething short o the maist preeminent apostles een tho i be naething truly the tokens o an apostle war wrocht amang ye in a langtholin in signs and ferlies and pooers,1
4394,2CO,3,SCO1904,but gin the message o death inscrivit in stane cam amid glorie sae that the children o isral warna fu able to look intil moses face for the glorie o his face whilk glorie was to come till an end hoo soudna raither the message o the spirit be in glorie for gin the message o condemnation was in glorie muckle mair the message o richtousness is fu o glorie,gin it yet be for nocht he than that supplyt to ye the spirit and wrocht ferlies amang ye did he it by warks o the law or by hearin o faith,1
4395,2CO,3,SCO1904,for in sooth that whilk was made glorious had nae glorie in comparison on accoont o the greater glorie for gif that whilk was to pass awa cam wi glorie muckle mair that whilk is to bide has glorie haein than siccan a hope we use unco plainness o speech and no like moses wha pat a veil ower his face sae that the children o isral soudna fulook to the end o that whilk was passin awa,wha schawed theirsels in glorie and spak o his depairtin whilk he soud accomplish at jerusalem,1
4396,2CO,3,SCO1904,for een to this vera day the same veil remains at the readin o the auld covenant no taen awa for to be taen awa in christ,but god plenteous in mercy for his unco love he loed us wi een tho we war deid by oor sins brocht us to life alang wi christ by tenderlove are ye saved and wi him raised us up and wi him gied us heevenlie seats in christ jesus that he micht schaw i the ages to come the unco owergaun riches o his love in kindness to us in christ jesus for it is by his love ye hae been saved throwe faith and this comes aboot no frae you it is gods free gift,1
4397,2CO,3,SCO1904,but to this day whaneer moses is read a veil ower their hearts is lyin,thir things didna his disciples think o at the first but whan jesus was glorifyt than mindit they that thir things war puttendoon anent him and that they had dune thir things to him,1
4398,2CO,3,SCO1904,hoobeit whansoeer a heart may turn toward the lord the veil is to be liftit aff,and it cam on the morn that their rulers and elders and scribes wi annas the heighpriest and caiaphas and john and alexander and a the lave o the heighpriests kin war gaithert thegither in jerusalem,1

4402,2CO,4,SCO1904,but gin aiblins oor joyfumessage has onyway come till ye veilt to them wha war perishin it cam to be veilt in wham the god o this warld made drumlie their perceptions least they soud discern the brichtness o christs joyfumessage o glorie wha is the image o god,haein than completit this and haein made siccar to them this frute i wull come back by you to spain,1
4403,2CO,4,SCO1904,for we proclaimna oor ain sels but christ jesus as lord and oorsels as yere servitors for jesus sake,for as in adam a dee sae in christ sal a be made leevin,1
4404,2CO,4,SCO1904,for god wha said oot o the mirk lat licht shine has lichtitup oor hearts to gie the licht o the knowledge o god i the face o christ,and they cam intil the hoose o the kirkelder and he saw a fash and folk greetin and wailin uncolie,1
4405,2CO,4,SCO1904,but we hae this treasur in veschels o clay that the owermasterin o the pooer may be o god and no o us,for naething be ye trauchlt i yere minds but in a things by prayer and supplication wi gean o thanks lat yere needs be made kent to god,1
4406,2CO,4,SCO1904,on ilka side pressed sair but no helpless switherin but no lackin escape pursued but no abandoned dung doon but no made an end o aye bearin aboot i the body the puttentodeid o jesus that sae een the life o jesus micht be schawn in oor body,and while peter considert the vision the spirit said to him see thrie meen seek ye,1
4407,2CO,4,SCO1904,for evermair we the leevin are delivert up tae death for jesus sake that jesus life micht be schawn in oor mortal flesh,eneuch that the learner sud fare as dis the teacher and the servant like his maister,1
4408,2CO,4,SCO1904,sae that death is wrocht in us inwardly but life in you,and here is the faithers wull wha sent me that oot o a he has gien me i soud tine nane but soud raise a up again at the last day,1
4409,2CO,4,SCO1904,hoobeit we hae the same spirit o faith conform to what is puttendoon i had faith tharfor spak i sae we hae faith and tharfor spak lippenin that he wha raised up the lord jesus wull also wi jesus raise us and wull present us wi you,ist no for ye to judge thae within,1
4410,2CO,4,SCO1904,for a things are for yere sakes sae that wi grace aboundin throwe the mony it may mak the praise to abound the mair to the glorie o god,for dool accordin to god works repentance to salvation no to be regrettit,1
4411,2CO,4,SCO1904,tharfor we arena faintheartit but een tho oor ootward man dwines awa yet oor inward man is ilka day renewin,and sae help ye ane anither een as christ helpit you to gods glorie,1
4412,2CO,4,SCO1904,for the wee bit passin sorrow that we hae is workin oot for us aye mair and mair a mair excellent and eternal wecht o glorie sae lang as we lookna for things seen but for things unseen for the seen things are but for a time but the things no seen are for aye,for it is time for judgment to begin at the hoosehauld o god but gif it first begin wi us what sal be the end o thae that gienain to the gudetidins o god,1
4413,2CO,5,SCO1904,for we ken that gin aiblins oor yirdly sheilin be taen doon we hae a biggin o god a dwallin no made wi hauns eternal i the heevens,see the feet o them that hae buryt yere gudeman are at the door and sal cairry ye oot and she fell juist doon at his feet and deet and the young men cam in and faund her deid and bure her oot and buryt her by her gudeman,1
4414,2CO,5,SCO1904,for truly in this behauf we maen unco fain to hae spread ower us oor hoose whilk is o heeven gin sae that bein covert we sanna be fund nakit,and the seeventh angel soondit and thar war lood voices in heeven sayin the kingdom o the warld is come to be the kingdom o oor lord and o his anointit and he sal reign for evir and aye and the fowrandtwenty elders wha sit on their throns fell on their faces and adored god sayin we gie thee thanks o lord god almichty wha is and wha was for that thou hast taen thy great pooer and did become king,1
4415,2CO,5,SCO1904,and vera truly we that are i the sheilin dae maen bein hauden doon yet we arena fain to be uncovert but raither to cover oorsels ower that what is mortal micht be swallowt up in immortality,i say tye that he wull be gleg to do them justice yet whan the son o man comes wull he eftir a fin this faith on the yirth,1
4416,2CO,5,SCO1904,noo he wha wrocht us oot for this vera thing is god wha een gied to us the firstfrutes o the spirit,for whasae sal think shame o me and my words in this fause and sinfu generation the son o man sal eke be ashamed o him whan he comes i the glorie o the faither wi the holie angels,1
4417,2CO,5,SCO1904,haein gude heart at a times kennin that whiles bidin i the body we are awa frae the lord for we are gaun on by faith and no by oor ain een,than says jesus till them a ye sal fin cause o stumblin in me this nicht for it is puttendoon i wull clour the shepherd and the sheep o his hirsel sal be scattert abreid but eftir my risin i wull gang afore ye intil galilee,1
4418,2CO,5,SCO1904,we hae gude heart nanetheless and are pleased raither to gang frae oot the body and to come ben to the lord and sae we are unco fain be we at hame or awa frae hame to pleasur him,and i saw an it war a glessy sea glintin bricht and they that had gotten the victory ower the beast and ower his image and ower his brand and ower the number o his name stude on the glessy sea haein the harps o god,1
4419,2CO,5,SCO1904,for we maun a be made seen at the bar o christ that ilk ane may hae conform to the things dune i the body een as he has dune be they gude or ill,for ilka ane a and every wha may ca on the name o the lord sal be saved hoo than soud they ca on ane on wham they haena lippened,1
4420,2CO,5,SCO1904,kennin than the dreid o the lord we perswad men but to god we are weelkent and i wad hope that een in yere consciences we hae been made weelkent,and they cam oot to see what had come to pass and cam to jesus and faund the man the demons had gane oot o cleedit and in his richt senses at the feet o jesus and they feart,1
4421,2CO,5,SCO1904,we dinna commend oorsels again to ye but gie ye opportunity to commend us that ye may hae something for thae wha boast o their ootward things and no in heart,faither save me frae this oor but een for this cam i intil this oor faither glorify thy name than cam thar a sough o a voice oot o the lift sayin i hae baith glorifyt it and wull again glorify it a the folk tharfor that stude by said it thunnert,1
4422,2CO,5,SCO1904,for een gin we war daft it was for god or are douce and grave it is for you,and he that keeps his commauns in christ abides and he in him and thus we ken that he abides in us throwe the spirit he has gien us,1
4423,2CO,5,SCO1904,for christs love rinks us in for we sae judge that gin ane deet for a than in consequence a deet and he deet for a that the leevin soud leeve nae langer to their sels but for him wha on their behauf deet and raise again,but jesus said to them a prophet is no wantin his honors gin it bena in his ain place and amang his ain freends and in his ain hoose,1
4424,2CO,5,SCO1904,sae that we frae this oot ken nae man conform to the flesh een gin we hae conform to the flesh kent the messiah yet noo frae this oot in siclike ken we him nae mair,and the lord says simon simon lo sautan seeks ye to riddle ye as wheat but i hae besocht for ye that yere faith disna fail whan ye hae turned again lift up yere brethren but he said to him lord i am ready to gang wi ye to dungeon and to death but he said i tell ye peter the cock winna craw this day till ye thrice deny that ye ken me and he said to them what time i sent ye oot wantin purse and wallet and shoon failed ye o onything,1
4425,2CO,5,SCO1904,sae than gif ony man is in christ thar is a new creation auld things hae gane by lo a things are made new but they are a o god wha reconcilt us to himsel throwe christ and gied to us the message o reconciliation hoo that god in christ was reconcilin the world to his ain sel no coontin up to them their sins and did pit in us the message o the reconciliation,and the pasche was narhaun a feast o the jews,1
4426,2CO,5,SCO1904,for christ than are we envoys as gin god war entreatin throwe us we beseech for christ be ye reconcilt to god him that kent nae sin has he made for us to be as sin that ye micht come to be a richtousness o god,and he took them to him and spak to them o the kingdom o god and healed thae that stude in need o healin,1

4610,GAL,3,SCO1904,noo to abram war the promises spoken and to his seed,when i brak the fyve bannocks to the fyvethoosan hoo mony basketsfu o mools took ye up,1
4611,GAL,3,SCO1904,it disna say and to seeds as o mony but as o ane and to thy seed whilk is christ,but he turned aboot and rebukit them,1
4612,GAL,3,SCO1904,but say i a covenant een afore made siccar by god the law whilk eftir fowr hunner and thretty years cam in disna pit by that it soud mak the promise feckless for gin aiblins the inheritance is by law it is nae langer by promise but to abram by promise had god bestown it,and they war sayin ane to anither whatna word is this that wi authoritie and pooer he gies orders to foul spirits and they come oot,1
4613,GAL,3,SCO1904,for the cause o sin it was addit till siccan a time as the seed to wham it was promised soud come whilk law was gien in chairge by messengers at the haun o a mediator,set forrit diligently zenas the writer and apollos that naething be wantin tae them,1
4614,GAL,3,SCO1904,but the mediator isna o ane but god is ane,and richtous lot sair vext wi the wanton lives o the wicked he delivert for wi seein and hearin that richtous ane dwallin among them was distressin his richtous saul wi their lawless deeds,1
4615,GAL,3,SCO1904,was the law than contrar to the promises o god,and he spak to his disciples that a sma boat soud wait on him on account o sae mony folk that they soudna thrang him,1
4616,GAL,3,SCO1904,far frae it for gin a law war gien that had pooer to gie life truly than by law soud hae been richtousness,and the frutes yere saul socht eftir hae depairtit frae ye and a the dainty and delicate things hae perisht frae ye and in naegate sal they be fun,1
4617,GAL,3,SCO1904,but the scriptur steekit up a things as aneath sin that the promise by faith in jesus christ soud be gien to thae that hae faith,and sae bein fain for ye we had been willin to gie ye no the gudeword o god only but een oor ain sauls for that ye had come to be sae loed o us,1
4618,GAL,3,SCO1904,but afore faith cam we war keepit siccar neath the law shut in to the faith aboot to be made kent,but i was made to be unco blythe i the lord that noo i the end yere care for me blossomd again tho in truth ye war carin but wantit opportunity,1
4619,GAL,3,SCO1904,sae that the law has been oor bairnkeeper to tak us to christ that we soud throwe faith be declart richtous,and mony ither things are thar that jesus did sae that gin aiblins they war to be penned every ane i tak it that een the warld itsel wadna haud the buiks that wad needs be penned,1
4620,GAL,3,SCO1904,but faith haein come we are nae mair aneath a bairnkeeper,and it cam aboot as he was at meat i the hoose that behauld mony taxmen and illdeedie anes cam and sat doon wi him and his disciples,1
4621,GAL,3,SCO1904,for ye are a sons o god throwe the faith in jesus christ,and sae as throwe the ae faut condemnation cam on a men sae throwe ae richtousness establisht the free gift comes to a men,1
4622,GAL,3,SCO1904,for ye as mony as war bapteezt into christ hae putten on christ,or are we to look for anither ane,1
4623,GAL,3,SCO1904,thar isna to be said jew nor greek thar isna to be said bond nor free thar isna to be said male nor female for a ye thegither are ane in christ jesus and gin ye are christs than are ye abrams seed and heirs een as said the promise,but the wisdom that is frae aboon is first to purify than peaceable and cannie easy to be entreatit fu o mercy and gude frutes wi nae puin doon and aefauld,1
4624,GAL,4,SCO1904,but i say sae long as the heir is a bairn he differsna frae a servant een tho aiblins he be the laird o a,and the pharisees and the sadducees cam and in a twafauld way speirt at him gin he wadna schaw them a token frae heeven,1
4625,GAL,4,SCO1904,but is aneath bairnkeepers and overseers till the time set by the faither,and gin the lord shortenedna the days nae flesh wad be saved but for the sake o his ain wham he waled oot for his sel he shortens the days,1
4626,GAL,4,SCO1904,sae we too whan we war bairns war keepit in bonds to the hornbuik o the warld but whan the fu time cam god sent oot his son wha cam o a wumman wha cam aneath the law that he micht redeem thae aneath the law sae that we coud receive the adoption o bairns,nor can they lead prufe o what they noo wyte me wi,1
4627,GAL,4,SCO1904,and mair for that ye are sons god sent oot his sons spirit into oor hearts cryin oot abba faither sae ye are nae mair a servant but a bairn and gin a bairn than an heir throwe god,and jesus seein him lyin and kennin he had lang been sae says to him wad ye be made hale,1
4628,GAL,4,SCO1904,but than in sooth no kennin god ye war in bondage neath thae that war by natur nae gods whauras noo eftir that ye hae owned god or raither been owned o him hoo ist that ye are gaun back again to the feckless and beggarlie beginnins to whilk ye wad fain ower again be in bondage,weel than did the gude become death to me,1
4629,GAL,4,SCO1904,ye preceesely observe days and months and years,christ redeemed us oot o the curse o the law bein made a curse on oor behauf for it is putten doon accurst is ilka ane hingin on a tree,1

4631,GAL,4,SCO1904,brethren i entreat ye in naething did ye wrang me but ye ken hoo that by reason o a weakness i the flesh i preached to ye the gudeword at the first and the temptation ye saw i my flesh ye despisedna nor scunnert at it but took me to yere hearts as an angel o god as christ jesus whaur than is that happiness o yours,and to the messenger o the kirk in sardis write ye thir things says he wi the seeven spirits o god and the seeven starns i ken what ye div and that ye hae the name o leevin whan ye are deid,1
4632,GAL,4,SCO1904,for i witness tye that gin it had been possible yere ain een wad ye hae pykit oot and gien to me sae noo hae i gotten to be yere fae for that i deal leal wi ye they zealouslie seek ye but no in a gude way aye they wad steek ye oot that ye may seek eftir them but it is gude for a gude thing to be socht eftir wi zeal at a times and no only whan i am wi ye,till i come gie gude attent to the readin to exhortin to teachin,1

4635,GAL,4,SCO1904,but tell me ye that wad fain be neath the law div ye no hear the law,and she says nae man my lord and quo jesus nae mair div i pass judgment on ye gang yere ways and sin nae mair than again spak jesus to them and said i am the warlds licht the man wha follows me walksna i the mirk but sal hae the licht o life the pharisees then replied to him ye gie witness o yersel yere ain witness allenar is nae prufe jesus answert them and quo he een gin i bear witness for mysel my witness is leal and true for i ken whaur i cam frae and whaur i gang till but ye kenna whaur i cam frae and whaur i gang,1
4636,GAL,4,SCO1904,for it is puttendoon abram had twa sons ane by a bondmaid and ane by a free wumman,and the kings o the yirth and the nobles and rulers o thoosands and the rich and the michty and ilka thirlman and ilka freeman hid theirsels i the caves and i the dens o the mountains sayin to the mountains and the craigs fa on us and beild us frae the face o him wha sits on the thron and frae the wrath o the lamb for the great day o their wrath is come and wha is fit to staun,1
4637,GAL,4,SCO1904,but the ane by the bondmaid hoobeit was born eftir the mainner o the flesh whauras the ane by the free wumman throwe a promise,noo hearin this they war bapteezt intil the name o the lord jesus,1
4638,GAL,4,SCO1904,whilk things in sooth are a parable,quo jesus to him i am the gate the truth and the life ilka man wha comes to the faither comes throwe me,1
4639,GAL,4,SCO1904,for thir weemen are twa covenants ane frae mount sinai bringin forth to bondage whilk in sooth is hagar,whan than ye wad do a gude wark dinna hae a buglehorn soondit afore ye as the pretenders div in kirks and merkits that they may be roosed o men,1
4640,GAL,4,SCO1904,for hagar is mount sinai in arabia and is like to jerusalem that noo is and is in bondage wi her bairns,and lookin up they see that the stane is rowt awa for it was an unco bouk,1
4641,GAL,4,SCO1904,but the jerusalem aboon is free wha indeed is mither to us a,least haein come again my god sal humble me amang ye and i sal hae to mak maen ower mony o thae wha had afore sinned and haena repentit o the uncleannesses and lechery and wantonness they war guilty o,1
4642,GAL,4,SCO1904,for it is puttendoon rejoice ye barren that burena brek oot intil shouts ye that warna in birthpangs for mair are the bairns o the desolat than o her that has the husband,and it cam aboot whan he was sutten doon wi them to meat he took the laif and blessd and breikin it gied till them,1
4643,GAL,4,SCO1904,but we brethren eftir the mainner o isaac are bairns o the promise,says ane frae mang their sels a prophet o their ain cretans aye fause rampin wildbeass idle pockpuddins this testimonie is true for whilk cause repruve them snellie that they may be hale i the faith,1
4644,GAL,4,SCO1904,but just as than the ane born eftir the flesh persecutit the ane born eftir the spirit een sae is it enoo,and the ither disciples cam wi the wee boat for they warna far frae lan but some fifty faddoms aff trailin the net o fish,1
4645,GAL,4,SCO1904,pit ye oot the bondmaid and her son for in naegate sal the bairn o the bondmaid inherit alang wi the bairn o the free,see i hae tellt ye aforehaun sae gin they say tye see he is in the desert gangna oot tak tent he is ben i the chaummer believeitna for as the fireflaucht glints i the east and flares een to the wast sae sal the comin o the son o man be,1
4646,GAL,4,SCO1904,sae brethren we arena the bondmaids bairns but the free wummans,and the desire haein conceived brings forth sin but the sin whan a is dune brings forth death beyena deceivt brethren belovd ilka gude grant and ilka perfetit gift is frae aboon comin doon frae the faither o lichts wi wham is nae unsiccarness nor shadow o gaun back,1
4647,GAL,5,SCO1904,wi freedom christ maks us free staun ye steive than and bena hauden fast wi ony yoke o bondage tak tent i paul say tye that gin ye receive circumceesion christ wull profit ye nocht,for we maun a be made seen at the bar o christ that ilk ane may hae conform to the things dune i the body een as he has dune be they gude or ill,1
4648,GAL,5,SCO1904,but i witness to ilka man again that receives circumceesion that he is a bund debtor to the hail law,nae ane begotten o god gangs on in sin for his seed in him abides and he canna gang on in sin for he is begotten o god,1
4649,GAL,5,SCO1904,ye are set aside frae christ ye wha wad be justifyt i the law ye are faun awa frae his favor,and a that heard him war astonished ayont a things at his wisdom and his sayins,1
4650,GAL,5,SCO1904,for we throwe the spirit are fain waitin for the hope o richtousness,and the men that war sent war pharisees,1
4651,GAL,5,SCO1904,for in christ jesus naither circumceesion coonts for ocht nor uncircumceesion but faith wrocht inwardly by love,and to gang throwe you intil macedonia and to come back to ye and by you to be set on forrit to judea,1
4652,GAL,5,SCO1904,ye gaed weel wha taiglt ye that ye soudna comply wi the truth,but he left the claith wi them and escapit nakit,1
4653,GAL,5,SCO1904,this compliance wasna o him wha cad ye a wee barm wull gang throwe the hail melder,and a the believin anes war thegither and had a things throweither,1

4655,GAL,5,SCO1904,but i brethren gin i be preachin circumceesion why am i sae persecutit,for it is containd i scriptur see i lay in zion a heid cornerstane chosen and hauden in honor and wha lippens on him sal in naegate be putten to shame,1
4656,GAL,5,SCO1904,for than had the bogle o the cross been dune awa,and sae as that the feck o the brethren haein been heartened i the lord by my bonds are mair uncolie bauld fearless speakin the word o god,1
4657,GAL,5,SCO1904,i wad they een wad cut aff their sels that fash ye,wha sees me sees the faither,1
4658,GAL,5,SCO1904,for ye war cad in freedom brethren but turnna yere freedom intil an indulgence to the flesh but raither by yere love ser ye ane anither,and said for this wull a man lea his faither and his mither and be joined to his wife and they twa sal be ae flesh sae that they are nae mair twa but ae flesh,1
4659,GAL,5,SCO1904,for the hail law is bund up in ae word this ye sal loe yere neebor as yersel but gin ye gansh at and devoor ane anither tak tent that ye bena destroyt ane o anither,for sic things as ye tellt i the mirk sal be heard i the licht and what to the secret hearin ye spak i the chaumer sal be cryt on the hoosetaps,1
4660,GAL,5,SCO1904,on the ither haun i say walk ye i the spirit and the wull o the flesh ye sanna fulfil,and sae ye my brethren whan ye come thegither to eat wait ye ane for anither,1
4661,GAL,5,SCO1904,for the flesh has desires contrar to the spirit and the spirit contrar to the flesh for thir again ane anither are set that ye mayna do the things ye wad itherwise do but gin than ye are led by the spirit ye arena under the law,for we that hae had faith div enter intil the rest conform to what he has said as i did sweer i my wrath they sanna enter intil my rest tho the warks war a endit frae the fundation o the yirth,1
4662,GAL,5,SCO1904,but plain to be seen are the warks o the flesh whilk are adultery lechery wantonness idolatry divination hatred fainoot jealousy wrath factions pairties envyins bludeshed druckenness revellins and siclike things as to whilk i tell ye plainly een as i hae tellt ye afore that they wha practeese sic things as thir sanna inherit gods kingdom,and he sawn amang the thorns this is he wha hears the word and than the cark o the warl and the glamor o riches smoor the word and it bears nae frute,1
4663,GAL,5,SCO1904,but the frute o the spirit is love happiness peace langtholin canniness gudeness lealness meekness selfguidin again sic things as thir thar is nae law but they wha are o christ jesus hae crucifyt the flesh wi its desires and hankerins,and at this present i coonsel ye to be o gude heart for loss o life thar sal be nane amang ye but the loss o the ship,1
4664,GAL,5,SCO1904,gin we leeve by the spirit by the spirit lat us een be airtit,but o the lave o the apostles saw i nane but james the brither o the lord,1

4666,GAL,6,SCO1904,brethren gin aiblins a man be betrayt intil a faut ye wha are spiritual recover sic a ane i the spirit o canniness lookin to yersel least ye yersel be tempit,for this micht hae been sellt for muckle and gien to the puir,1
4667,GAL,6,SCO1904,uphaud ye ane anithers burdens sae sal ye perform the law o christ,and the ten hearin it war unco angry again the twa brithers,1
4668,GAL,6,SCO1904,for gin a man thinks he is something whan he is naething he is but deceivin his sel in his ain mind,and judas iscariot wha een deliverthimup,1
4669,GAL,6,SCO1904,but lat ilka man test his ain wark and than sal he hae pleasur in himsel allenarlie and no in what anither thinks,they say till him we are fit he says to them ye sal truly drink my cup but to sit on my richt haun and on my left haun isna mine to gie but to thae my faither has prepart it for,1
4670,GAL,6,SCO1904,for ilka man sal cairry his ain backburden,and whan they had putten them i the mids they speirt by whatna pooer or whatna name hae ye dune this,1
4671,GAL,6,SCO1904,nanetheless lat him that is instructit i the word hae fellowship wi him that instructs in a gude things,for sae soud the wumman wear this permission on her heid conscious o the angels,1
4672,GAL,6,SCO1904,dinna deceive yer sels god isna to be mocked for what a man saws the same sall he shear for he that saws till his ain flesh oot o the flesh sal hae corruption but he wha saws to the spirit oot o the spirit sal hae lifeforaye,and some fell whaur thorns had been and up cam the thorns and smoored it,1
4673,GAL,6,SCO1904,but in doin what is weel lat us no be cuistendoon for in due time we sal reap gin we gienaup,i wad but ken this frae ye wast by the warks o the law that ye hae gotten the spirit or by the hearin o faith,1
4674,GAL,6,SCO1904,sae than een as we hae openins lat us work what is gude toward a men special toward the hoosehauld o the faith,and i saw whan the lamb lowsed ane o the seals and i heard ane o the leevinanes sayin in a voice o thunner come and i saw and lo a white horse and he that was on it was haudin a bow and a croon was gien to him and he gaed oot conquerin and that he soud conquer,1
4675,GAL,6,SCO1904,see wi sic muckle letters i wrate tye wi my ain haun as monie as wad mak a bonnie schaw i the flesh they wad gar ye be circumceesed only that they soudna dree persecution for the cross o christ,and peter comin to his sel said noo ken i o a certaintie that the lord sent oot his angel and delivert me frae herods haun and frae a the expectation o the jewish folk,1
4676,GAL,6,SCO1904,for no een they wha hae become circumceesed are their sels observin the law but they wad hae ye circumceesed that they micht boast theirsels in your flesh,and they war a astoundit and glorifyt god and war fu o dreid sayin we hae seen unco things the day and eftir thir things he gaed forth and saw a taxman cad levi presidin at the taxliftin and said to him be followin me and forsakin a he raise and followt him,1

5192,HEB,1,SCO1904,but at sic a time again as he soud send the firstbegotten into the warld he says and lat a the angels worship him and o the angels he says wha maks his angels be winds and his servitors flauchts o fire,far frae that div ye no ken that to the ane ye are giean yersels ower to obey as servants servants dae ye become to wham ye gie obedience whether aiblins it be o sin to death or obedience to holiness,1
5193,HEB,1,SCO1904,but anent the son thy thron o god is to a ages and the sceptre o thy kingdom is a sceptre o richtousness thou hast loed richtousness and scunnerd at ill and for this god has anointit thee wi the oyle o gladness aboon thy marrows and thou lord at the foreend did set the fundation o the yirth and the heevens are the warks o thy hauns,for ye that wad loe life and see gude days let him gar his tongue cease frae ill and his lips that they speakna guile,1
5194,HEB,1,SCO1904,they sal dwine awa but thou bides for aye and they a as a wearindud sal end and as a maud sal thou fauld them up and theyse be changed but thou art aye the same and thy years endna but to whilk ane o the angels has he said at ony time sit thou at my richt haun till i mak thy faes the fitbrod o thy feet,the sough o ane cryin oot i the waste mak ye ready a gate for the lord mak straucht his fitroads than raise john bapteezin i the muirlands and preachin repentancebaptism for the pittinawa o sins,1
5195,HEB,1,SCO1904,arena they a waitin spirits sent oot to wait on thae that sal inherit salvation,gie ye to her een as she hersel has gien and dooble ye to her the dooble conform to her wark in the cup she has made fou fill ye to her the dooble,1
5196,HEB,2,SCO1904,and for the sake o a this we soud ettle sair to haud fast the things that war heard least at ony time we soud slype awa,and the lord says wha than is the true leal steward the canny ane wham his maister wull set ower his hameservants to gie them at due times the portion o their meat,1
5197,HEB,2,SCO1904,for gif the word spoken throwe angels was stieve and ilka ganginagley and disobedience gat its true recompense o reward hoo sal we scape gif we gie the gangby to sae great a salvation whilk in truth begude to be spoken throwe the lord by they wha heard and to us was made siccar god bearin cowitness baith wi tokens and ferlies and monyfauld warks o pooer and gifts o the holie spirit conform to his wull,but noo athegither sindry frae the law a richtousness o god has been set forth bein uphauden by the law and the prophets een a richtousness o god throwe faith in jesus christ comin to a wha hae faith for a are ane for a hae sinned and a fail o the glorie o god bein held richtous freely throwe his ain favor by the redeemin o christ jesus wham god sut forth as oor coverinower by faith in his blude for the settin forth o his richtousness to the passinby o oor auld sins to schaw the gudeness o god in his tholin at this time to the end he micht be richtous his sel while declarin richtous the man wha believes in jesus,1
5198,HEB,2,SCO1904,for it wisna to angels he subjeckit the comin warld o whilk we are speakin for ane in ae place bure witness sayin what is man that thou soud keep him in mind,and he answert them it is that till you it has been gien to ken o the things o the heevenlie kingdom but to them it isna sae gien,1
5199,HEB,2,SCO1904,or mans bairn that thou soud visit him,but herod the kingdepute being repruvd by him anent herodias his brother philips wife and for a the mony ills herod had dune addit this tillt a that he cuist john in prison,1
5200,HEB,2,SCO1904,thou did mak him for a wee laigher nor the angels thou did croon him wi glorie and honor and did set him ower the warks o thy hauns,and they speirt at him maister we a ken ye speak and teach richtly and accept nae mans face but teach the way o god truly,1
5201,HEB,2,SCO1904,thou did pit a things subject aneath his feet,and he gaed throwe syria and cilicia strenthenin the kirks,1
5202,HEB,2,SCO1904,for in makin a things subject to him naething was left oot that wasna made subject to him whauras noo we seena yet a things to him made subject,the holie spirit sae makin it seen that the gate to the holiest hadna yet been made plain whiles the first tabernacle was staunin,1
5203,HEB,2,SCO1904,but the ane wha was made for a wee laigher nor the angels div we behauld een jesus crooned wi glorie and honor throwe the pangs o death that by the tenderlove o god he might pree o death for a men,and whan he was come the lenth o jerusalem he ettled to join his sel to the disciples but they war a fleyt o him and jaloused that he was a fause ane,1
5204,HEB,2,SCO1904,for it behoovd him for whase sake are a things and throwe wham are a things in leading mony sons to glorie that the chieftain o their salvation soud by sufferins be made perfete,and gaun aff they faund as he had tellt them and made ready the pasche,1
5205,HEB,2,SCO1904,for baith he wha maks holie and they wha are made holie are a o ane for whilk cause he isna backward to ca them brethren,he wha taks in a seer in the name o a seer sal receive a seers reward and he wha taks in a holie man i the name o a holie man wins a holie mans reward,1
5206,HEB,2,SCO1904,sayin i wull mak kent thy name to my brethren amang a the thrang wull i sing praise to thee and again i wull stievely lippen him and again behauld i and the bairns god has gien me,een though i mysel micht lay some stress een on things o the flesh,1
5207,HEB,2,SCO1904,seein than that the bairns had pairt in the flesh and blude he eke in sic mainner had fellowship i the same that by means o his death he micht ding the pooer o him that had the dominion o death that is the adversary and micht deliver thir as mony as frae fear o death war a their life under bondage,and thar gat up an arglebargle amang them wha o them soud be heighest,1
5208,HEB,2,SCO1904,for no truly is he takin haud o angels but he lays haud o abrams seed,and jesus answert them are ye come oot as again a robber wi swords and rungs to tak me,1
5209,HEB,2,SCO1904,and sae in a things he bude be made like his brethren that he micht be a mercifu and leal heighpriest in the things o god to mak a reconciliation for folks sins,than the disciples ilka ane as he had ability was mindit to send charitie to the brethren dwallin in judea,1
5210,HEB,2,SCO1904,for seein he dreed his sel and was tempit he kens weel to rescue them that are in temptation,are ye lowsed frae a wife,1
5211,HEB,3,SCO1904,sae holie brethren the biddenanes o a heevenlie biddin look weel at the apostle and heighpriest o oor profession jesus,noo whan jesus was in bethanie i the hoose o simon the leper thar cam till him a wumman wi an alabaster box o unco precious perfume and she teemed it on his heid as he was at meat,1
5212,HEB,3,SCO1904,wha was leal to him wha made him priest as was moses in a his hoose,god sent a man o the name o john,1
5213,HEB,3,SCO1904,for he is coontit wordie o mair glorie nor moses by as muckle as he wha biggs the hoose has mair glorie nor the hoose,and comin to jerusalem they war welcomed by the kirk and the apostles and the elders and gaed ower a the things god had dune by them,1
5214,HEB,3,SCO1904,for ilka hoose is made by some ane but he wha made a things is god,comin to ken that the testin o yere faith works oot langtholin,1
5215,HEB,3,SCO1904,and indeed moses was leal in a his hoose as a steward for a witness o the things that war to be spoken but christ as a son ower his ain hoose whase hoose are we gin aiblins we haud siccar the freedom o the promise and the glorie o the hope to the end,only they war hearin he wha was persecutin us at ae time is noo preachin the joyfumessage o the faith that ance he laid waste and they magnifyt god in me,1
5216,HEB,3,SCO1904,whaurfor een as says the holie spirit the day gin ye may hear his voice hardenyena yere hearts as in the bitter thrawartness on the day o temptation i the desert whan yere forbears tempit me wi a test and saw my warks forty year,wha speaks allenar o his sel seeks but his ain glorie but wha seeks the glorie o him that sent him yon same man is leal and true and nae fauseness in him,1
5217,HEB,3,SCO1904,sae was i sair vexed wi this generation and said aye gang they agley i their heart and they divna ken my ways,yet she sal be saved in her bairntime gif they abide in faith and love and holiness,1
5218,HEB,3,SCO1904,sae did i sweer i my wrath they sal enterna intil my rest tak ye tent brethren least at ony time thar soud be in ony o ye a dour heart o unbelief in fainawa frae the leevin god but exhort anetheither day by day een as lang as it is cad the day least ony o ye be hardened throwe the glamor o sin,bide in me as i bide in you,1
5219,HEB,3,SCO1904,for gin we haud siccar tae the hinner end the beginnin o oor faith we hae come to be pairtners wi christ,for the haun o the lord was wi him,1
5220,HEB,3,SCO1904,while it is said the day gin ye wull hear his voice hardenyena yere hearts as in the bitter thrawartness for wha wast tho they heard caused the bitterness,for truly the son o man camna to be sert but to ser and to gie his life a ransom for mony,1
5221,HEB,3,SCO1904,na didna a thae wha cam oot o egypt by moses,god kens better but as i am doin i wull do that i may sned aff occasion frae thae wha seek for occasion that in what they glorie they be fund een as we are,1
5222,HEB,3,SCO1904,but wham was he sair vexed wi for forty year,and whan i saw him i loutit doon at his feet as ane deid,1
5223,HEB,3,SCO1904,wast no wi thae that sinned wha fell i the desert,sae the hinmaist sal be first and the first hinmaist,1
5224,HEB,3,SCO1904,and to wham swure he that they soudna enter intil his rest but to thae wha war thrawn and dour,this is gude and pleasin i the sicht o god oor saviour wha wad hae a men to be saved and to come to fukennin o the truth,1
5225,HEB,3,SCO1904,and we see they warna able to enter in for unbelief,and their voices and o the heidpriests owercam,1
5226,HEB,4,SCO1904,lat us than hae fear least at ony time tho thar be a promise left o enterin intil his rest ony frae mang ye soud come short ot,and he said to them dae ye fesh a licht and pit it under a cog and no to be putten on the staun,1
5227,HEB,4,SCO1904,for to us has the joyfumessage been gien een as to them but the word o their hearin did them nae gude they no makin their sels ane in faith wi thae that hearkent,and the lave war slain by the sword o him that sat on the horse the sword that gaed forth oot o his mooth and a the ravenin birds war filled wi their flesh,1
5228,HEB,4,SCO1904,for we that hae had faith div enter intil the rest conform to what he has said as i did sweer i my wrath they sanna enter intil my rest tho the warks war a endit frae the fundation o the yirth,and i saw whan the lamb lowsed ane o the seals and i heard ane o the leevinanes sayin in a voice o thunner come and i saw and lo a white horse and he that was on it was haudin a bow and a croon was gien to him and he gaed oot conquerin and that he soud conquer,1
5229,HEB,4,SCO1904,for he has said in a place anent the seeventh day thus and god restit on the seeventh day frae a his warks,quo he come ye and see they cam and saw whaur he dwalt and bade wi him the lave o that day for it was nar haun fowr oclock,1
5230,HEB,4,SCO1904,and in this place again gif they sal enter intil my rest sae seein it is left ower for some to enter intilt and they wha afore had the joyfumessage delivert to them entertna in on accoont o thrawartness,but ye lichtlie the puir ane,1
5231,HEB,4,SCO1904,he still marks oot a certain day sayin by dauvid een eftir sae lang a time as that juist like as it had been said afore the day gin aiblins ye hear his voice makna hard yere hearts for gin joshua had gien rest to them he wadna i that case hae been speakin eftir thae things o anither day,and he said to them what for are ye puttenaboot,1
5232,HEB,4,SCO1904,sae thar is bein left ower a sabbathkeepin for a the folk o god for he that entert intil his rest he eke has restit frae a his warks as god did frae his,and sae i the risinagain whase wife o them sal she be,1
5233,HEB,4,SCO1904,lat us than gie a tent to enter intil that rest least ony ane fas i the same example o thrawartness,for a covenant is made siccar eftir a death but it is o nae effeck while the covenanter leeves,1
5234,HEB,4,SCO1904,for gods word is leevin and michty keener nor a twaedged sword thringin throwe to the pairtin o saul and spirit o joints and marrow and gleg at discernin the airtins and ettlins o the heart,and temple saw i nane tharin for the lord god almichty and the lamb are her temple and the citie isna wantin for the sun nor yet for the mune that they soud be shinin int for the glorie o god is her licht and the lamb is the lamp ot,1
5235,HEB,4,SCO1904,and thar isna a creatit thing that can be hidden frae his sicht but a things are nakit and laid bare to the een o him wham we hae to do wi,nae unco ferlie than gin his servants too are cheengin theirsels as servants o richtousness whase end sal be een as their warks are,1
5236,HEB,4,SCO1904,haein than a great heighpriest wha has gane up throwe the heevens jesus the son o god lat us haud siccar oor confession for we haena a heighpriest that hasna a britherfeelin wi oor weaknesses but ane wha was tempit in a the likeness o oorsels yet wantin sin,whan jesus straughtit his sel up and saw nane but the wumman he says to her whaur are they that wytit ye,1
5237,HEB,4,SCO1904,lat us than draw nar wi freedom o speech to the thron o tenderlove that we may obteen mercie and find favor to help us in oor need,sae that ye fa ahint in nae gift o grace fainwaitin for the revealin o oor lord jesus christ wha sal een mak ye siccar throwe a unblameable i the day o oor lord jesus christ,1
5238,HEB,5,SCO1904,for ilka heighpriest taen frae among men is appointit for things o god that he may offer baith gifts and sacrifeeces for sins as ane wha can marrow weel in his heart wi thae that are ignorant and gane aside sin he his sel is rinkit roon wi weakness and on this accoont he bude for his sel sae for the folk to be offerin for sins,and for this cause i pit ye in mind to steer up gods gift that is in ye throwe the layinon o my hauns,1
5239,HEB,5,SCO1904,and nae man taks to him this honor but is cad by god een as aaron was,the spirit is fain but the flesh is waff,1
5240,HEB,5,SCO1904,and sae een christ magnifytna himsel to be made a heighpriest but raither it was he that spak to him sayin my son art thou this day hae i begotten thee,for the faither judges nae man but has gien ower a judgment to the son sae that a men soud gie honor to the son een as they gie honor to the faither,1
5241,HEB,5,SCO1904,een as in anither place he says thou a priest for aye i the order o melchizedek,and sae my brethren belovd and micklelangedfor my rejoicin sae staun siccar i the lord my beloved euodia i entreat and syntyche i entreat that ye be o ae mind i the lord,1
5242,HEB,5,SCO1904,wha i the days o his flesh eftir offerin up prayers and entreaties to him wha was strang to save him frae death wi sair ootcries and tears and had been heard for his godly fear,whan they heard that they war cut to the heart and coonsellt thegither to kill them,1
5243,HEB,5,SCO1904,een tho he was a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he tholed and bein perfetit becam to a thae obeyin him the fundation o an endless salvation haein been addressed by god himsel as heighpriest i the order o melchizedek,and he grew unco hungry and wad fain eaten a wee but whiles they war preparin he fell intil a dwaum and saw the lift unsteekit and a kind o veschel comin doon as a great sheet loutit doon by the fowr corners in whilk war a the beass and creaturs o the yirth and birds o the air,1
5244,HEB,5,SCO1904,anent wham we hae muckle to say and are sair beset hoo to say it seein ye are become feckless in hearin,devout and fearin god wi a his hoose giean aumous to the folk and prayin to god aye,1
5245,HEB,5,SCO1904,for een whan ye soud hae come to be teachers i the lapse o time ye hae need ance mair that ane be teachin you the vera elements o the first principles o the oracles o god and are gotten to be sic as hae need o milk and no o mans meat,but anent what ye wrate to me it is gude for a man no to be bund to a wumman,1
5246,HEB,5,SCO1904,for ilka ane takin milk wants skill i the word o richtousness for he is a wean but tae sic as are mangrown pertains mans meat to thae wha throwe proper use hae their pooers exerceest to discern baith gude and ill,save yersel and come doon frae the cross and as weel the heidpriests jeerin amang their sels wi the writers said he saved ithers his sel he canna save the christ the king o isral lat him noo come doon frae the cross that seein it we may lippen him and the anes crucifyt wi him miscad him,1
5247,HEB,6,SCO1904,tharfor lat us lea thir beginnins o the things o christ and gang on toward fu growth no layin ower again the fundation o turning frae deid warks and o faith toward god,and lichtin on disciples we bade thar seeven days wha war giean paul warnin by the spirit no to be gaun up till jerusalem,1
5248,HEB,6,SCO1904,o the teachin anent bapteezins and o layinon o hauns and o the risin fraethedeid and o eternal judgment,and eke the first covenant had its ordinances o divine service and a sanctuary o this present warld,1
5249,HEB,6,SCO1904,and this wull we do gin at least god permit,but followna eftir their warks for they say and dona,1
5250,HEB,6,SCO1904,for it isna possible as to thae wha ance had licht and had preed the freegift o heeven and had been made to partak o the holie spirit,and een as we bure the likeness o the yirthly ane we sal een bear the likeness o the heevenly ane,1
5251,HEB,6,SCO1904,and had preed the sweet word o god and the pooers o the warld to come and then fain awa ance mair to newform them until repentance seein they are crucifyin ower again to their sels the son o god and makin a public shame o him for the grund that sooks in the aftfain rain and brings forth what they wad fain hae wha till it receives blessin frae god but gin it bear thorns and briers it is no esteemed and is narhaun bein curst whase end is to be brunt,and whan they had nocht to pay wi he forgae them baith,1
5252,HEB,6,SCO1904,but we are perswadit better things o you beloved een things o salvation tho we div sae speak,aylsander the coppersmith did me muckle skaith the lord wull gie to him conform to his wark,1
5253,HEB,6,SCO1904,for god is no illdeedie to be forgettin yere wark and love that ye schawed forth for his name in serin the saunts and still serin,and wha taksna up his cross to follow me isna wordie o me,1
5254,HEB,6,SCO1904,but we hae mickle desire that ilk ane o ye schaw forth the same perseverin to the fu confidence o hope een tae the end,but is aneath bairnkeepers and overseers till the time set by the faither,1
5255,HEB,6,SCO1904,that ye bena slack but followin on eftir thae wha by faith and longtholin fell heirs to the promises,and they seein the officer and the sodgers quat clourin paul,1
5256,HEB,6,SCO1904,for whan god made promise to abram seein thar war nane greater to sweer by he swure by his sel sayin certes in blessin wull i bless thee and in multiplyin wull i multiply thee and sae tholin patiently he gat the promise,noo peter and john war gaun into the temple for the oor o prayer thrie oclock,1
5257,HEB,6,SCO1904,for men sweer by ane greater and wi them an aith is the end o a disputin,than said the king to his servants bind him haunandfit and cast him oot intil the deidmirk thar wull be greetin and cherkin o teeth for a hantle are bidden but only a wheen waled oot,1
5258,HEB,6,SCO1904,and sae god bein muckle mair willin to schaw forth to the heirs o the promise the siccarness o his coonsel cam in wi an aith,but we are perswadit better things o you beloved een things o salvation tho we div sae speak,1
5259,HEB,6,SCO1904,for by twa unchangeable things in whilk it wasna possible for god to be fause a stieve consolation we soud hae wha fled to grip the hope set afore us whilk hope we hae as an anchor o the saul baith siccar and sure and comin ben within the veil,but they staunin by said dae ye speak ill o gods heighpriest,1
5260,HEB,6,SCO1904,whaur jesus as forerinner for us has entert wha was made a heighpriest for aye i the order o melchizedek,than gangs awa he and takin wi him seeven mair waur nor himsel enters in and bides thar and that mans last state is waur nor the first,1
5261,HEB,7,SCO1904,for this melchizedek king o salem priest o god maist heigh that forgathert wi abram as he cam back frae the slauchtir o the kings and blesst him till wham gied abram een a tenth o a he bein first by translation king o richtousness and than as weel king o salem whilk is king o peace wantin faither wantin mither withoot pedigree haein naither beginnin o days nor end o life but made to be like the son o god bides a priest withoot interruption,and sae layin haud o him they had him up to the areopagus sayin can we no get to ken what this new teachin is that ye are speakin,1
5262,HEB,7,SCO1904,and noo think hoo great this man is till wham abram gied a tenth oot o the best spoil een abram the patriarch and they truly frae amang levis sons wha are gien the priesthood hae instructions to tak tithes o the folk conform to the law that is o their brethren een tho they hae come oot o the loins o abram but he wha winsna his pedigree frae them gat tithes frae abram and blesst him wha had the promises,and they cam tae jericho and as he gaed oot o jericho wi his disciples and a hantle o folk the son o timeus blin bartimeus the beggar was sittin by the way,1
5263,HEB,7,SCO1904,but aboon a disputin the heigher aye blesses the laigher,and like as moses i the wilderness heized up the serpent sae maun the son o man be liftit heigh that a wha lippen till him soudna dee but hae life for aye for god sae loved the warld as to gie his son the onlybegotten ane that ilka ane wha lippens till him sudna dee but hae life for aye,1
5264,HEB,7,SCO1904,and here truly men wha dee tak tithes but thar ane taks them wha obteens witness that he leeves,and vera truly we that are i the sheilin dae maen bein hauden doon yet we arena fain to be uncovert but raither to cover oorsels ower that what is mortal micht be swallowt up in immortality,1
5265,HEB,7,SCO1904,and sae to speak een levi wha taks tithes pays tithes throwe abram for yet i the loins o his faither was he whan melchizedek forgathert wi him,whaurfor my loved anes flee frae eidolworship as to discernin men i speak judge ye what i am sayin,1
5266,HEB,7,SCO1904,noo truly than gin thar war a perfetin throwe the levitical priesthood for neath it the folk had the law gien them whatna need wus thar for a different priest to be raised up conform to the order o melchizedek and no be named as conform to the order of aaron,thir are they that mak separations nateral men no possessin the spirit but ye beloved upbiggin yersels i yere maist holie faith prayin i the holie spirit keep yersels in gods love lookin for the mercie o oor lord jesus christ until lifeforaye,1
5267,HEB,7,SCO1904,for seein thar is a change o priesthood thar maun een as weel be a change o law,and hoo that oor gudeword didna come to ye as tidings in word alane but eke in pooer and the holie spirit and in strang certaintie een as ye kent whatna kind o men we schawed oorsels amang ye for your sakes and ye took paittern eftir us and eftir the lord takin to ye the word amang mickle affliction wi joy i the holie spirit sae that ye cam to be a paittern to a the believin anes in macedonia and in greece,1
5268,HEB,7,SCO1904,for he o wham thir things are said has pairt wi a different tribe frae whilk nae man has gien attendance at the altar,thar was ane o the pharisees by name nicodemus and in authoritie amang the jews,1
5269,HEB,7,SCO1904,for the truth is siccar that oot o judah sprang oor lord anent whilk tribe moses spak naething aboot priests,and noo see ye sal be dumb and hae nae speech until whatna day thir things are dune for that ye wadna lippen my words whilk sal come to pass i their time and the folk war waitin for zachariah and ferlied at his delayin i the temple,1
5270,HEB,7,SCO1904,and still muckle mair is it evident that conform to the likeness o melchizedek is to be raised up a different priest wha has been made a priest no conform to the rule o a commandment dealin wi flesh but conform to the pooer o a life for aye,but what gaed ye oot tae see,1
5271,HEB,7,SCO1904,for it is witnessed thou art a priest for aye o the order o melchizedek for truly a settinaside o a foregaun commandment comes aboot on account o its weakness and want o profit,noo the god o peace that led up frae amang the deid oor lord jesus the great shepherd o the sheep throwe the blude o the everbidin covenant mak ye perfete in ilka gude thing for the workin o his wull doin in ye that whilk is weelpleasin afore his face throwe jesus christ tae wham be glorie for evir and evir amen,1
5272,HEB,7,SCO1904,for the law brocht naething to perfection but thar is the cominin o a better hope throwe whilk we draw nar to god,he said forby a particular man had twa sons and the young son said till his faither faither gie me my portion that wad fa to me o a the gear and he portioned oot till them his leevin,1
5273,HEB,7,SCO1904,and inasmuckle as it wasna wantin an aithtakin for thae priests war made wantin an aith whauras he wi an aithtakin by him that said to him the lord swure and gangsna back thou art a priest for aye o the order o melchizedek by sae muckle as this has jesus come to be cation o a heigher covenant,but thir things brethren i hae sae to speak taen to mysel and apollos for yere sakes sae as in us ye micht learn the lear no to gang ayont what is puttendoon that ye soudna be swallin yersels up ilk ane again anither,1
5274,HEB,7,SCO1904,and truly in lairger numbers hae they been made priests for that on accoont o death they coudna bide but he in that he bides for aye everconstant hauds the priesthood,frae whatna way than has it tares,1
5275,HEB,7,SCO1904,sae is he able to sauf to a extremitie thae that come throwe him to god leevin aye to intercede in their behauf,thinkna i am come to cast abreid quateness on the yirth i comena to cast quateness but a sword,1
5276,HEB,7,SCO1904,for siccan a heighpriest as this for us was aye meet wha was holie innocent uncorrupt sindry frae sinners and made to be aboon the heevens,and truly in lairger numbers hae they been made priests for that on accoont o death they coudna bide but he in that he bides for aye everconstant hauds the priesthood,1
5277,HEB,7,SCO1904,wha has nae need day by day to be offerin up sacrifeeces like thae heighpriests for his ain sins and than for thae o the folk,god sent a man o the name o john,1
5278,HEB,7,SCO1904,for this he did ance for a whan his ain sel he offert for the law appointit men heighpriests haein weakness but the word o the aithtakin whilk was eftir the law appoints the son wha is consecrate for evermair,and jesus says to simon fearna frae this time ye sal tak men and bringin their boats to the lan they left a and followt him,1
5279,HEB,8,SCO1904,but as bringing to a point what we hae said siccan a heighpriest hae we as this wha is set on the richt haun o the thron o the majestie i the heevens o the holie place and o the true tabernacle whilk the lord pitched and no a man,and he says the ane that dealt in compassion wi him and jesus says to him gang ye and be doin siclike noo as they gaed on he cam intil a certain toon and a certain wumman named martha bade him intil her hoose,1
5280,HEB,8,SCO1904,for ilka heighpriest is ordeened for the offerin o baith gifts and sacrifeeces and it was necessar for this ane too that he soud hae that whilk he micht offer,for christ is what the law ettles at i the way o richtousness to ilka ane wha has faith,1
5281,HEB,8,SCO1904,gin than the lord had been on yirth he hadna been a priest ava sin thar are thae offering the gifts conform to the law,and to gang throwe you intil macedonia and to come back to ye and by you to be set on forrit to judea,1
5282,HEB,8,SCO1904,wha een as a glint and shadow o heevenlie things are doin service een as moses had word whan aboot to finish the tabernacle for tak tent says he that ye mak a things conform to the paittern schawn to ye i the mount,and richtous lot sair vext wi the wanton lives o the wicked he delivert for wi seein and hearin that richtous ane dwallin among them was distressin his richtous saul wi their lawless deeds,1
5283,HEB,8,SCO1904,but noo has he obteened a mair noble ministry by as muckle as he is the mediator o a heigher covenant whilk is established on heigher promises,but eftir his brethren had gane up he gaed up to the feast as weel no afore a the folk but like as it war hidlins,1
5284,HEB,8,SCO1904,for gin the first had been perfete nae need wad thar hae been for a second,and pilate was again speirin at them what than wad ye that i soud do to the king o the jews,1
5285,HEB,8,SCO1904,for as wytin them he says tak tent the days come says the lord that i wull mak wi the hoose o isral and the hoose o judah a new covenant,for he was unco fain to see ye a and in dolor for that ye had heard he had been ill,1
5286,HEB,8,SCO1904,no conform to the covenant i made wi their forbears i the day i took them by the haun to lead them oot o the land o egypt for it was that they badena i my covenant and i disregairdit them says the lord,seein that we tho mony are a ae laif ae body for we a o the ae laif partak,1
5287,HEB,8,SCO1904,but this is the covenant i wull covenant wi israls hoose eftir thae days says the lord i wull pit my laws i their minds and write them on their hearts and i wull be to them for a god and they sal be for me a folk,and he instruckit them that they soud tell nane but accordin as he instruckit them sae muckle the mair did they tell ot and they were astonisht ayont a bounds sayin he has done a things weel he gars een the deif to hear and the dumb to speak,1
5288,HEB,8,SCO1904,and nae need ilk ane to teach his marrow or ilk ane his brither sayin ken ye the lord for a they sal ken me frae the smaest to the greatest o them,thar salute ye eubulus and pudens and linus and claudia and a the brethren,1
5289,HEB,8,SCO1904,for i wull be mercifu to their unrichtousness and o their sins will i be mindfu nae mair by this word a new covenant he made the first ane auld but what is made past use and auld is passin awa,a the kirks o christ salute you,1
5290,HEB,9,SCO1904,and eke the first covenant had its ordinances o divine service and a sanctuary o this present warld,for john tellt herod it is no allood for ye to hae the wife o yere brither and sae herodias held a grudge again him and wad hae slain him but she coudna,1
5291,HEB,9,SCO1904,for a tabernacle was plenisht the first in whilk war baith the lampstead and the table and the settinforth o the breid whilk is cad the holie,sae joseph comin oot o his sleep did as the angel had bidden him and took till him his wife,1
5292,HEB,9,SCO1904,but eftir the second veil the tabernacle cad the holie o holies haein a gowden censer and the ark o the covenant owerlaid wi gowd in whilk was a gowden pat haudin the manna and aarons wand that bloomed and the tables o the covenant but ower aboon it the cherubim o glorie owershadin the mercyseat anent whilk things it isna necessar enoo to speak specially,ane that set aside moses law deet withoot pitie afore twa or thrie witnesses,1
5293,HEB,9,SCO1904,noo when thir things war sae ordeened intil the first tabernacle gaed aye continually the priests makin the services but intil the second the heighpriest alane ance ilka year and no wantin blude whilk he offers for his sel and for the blinness o the folk,a man had twa sons and he cam to the first ane and quo he son gang and work the day in my vineyaird he answerin said i winna but eftir he bethocht him and gaed,1
5294,HEB,9,SCO1904,the holie spirit sae makin it seen that the gate to the holiest hadna yet been made plain whiles the first tabernacle was staunin,and he says to them whase is this heid and this inscription,1
5295,HEB,9,SCO1904,whilk indeed was a likeness for the time noo come conform to whilk was offert baith gifts and offerans that canna as to the conscience mak him perfete wha offers the service bein but eatin and drinkin and a hantle o purifications appointit to a time o mair licht,at whatna time the foul spirit gangs oot o a man it gangs throwe drouthie pairts lookin for rest,1
5296,HEB,9,SCO1904,but whan christ drew nar a heighpriest o comin gude things throwe the better and mair perfete tabernacle no made wi hauns that is no o this creation nor yet throwe blude o goats and cauves but throwe his ain blude he entert in ance for a to the holie place haein won eternal redemption for gin the blude o goats and bulls and the assis o a quey strinklin the defild sanctifies to the pureness o the flesh hoo muckle mair sal the blude o christ wha throwe the everleevin spirit offert his sel wantin blemish until god purify yere conscience frae deid warks to the offerin up o a divine service to the leevin god,and sae he said like to what is the kingdom o god,1
5297,HEB,9,SCO1904,and for sic a reason is he the mediator o a new covenant to the end that a death haein taen place for the redeemin o sins aneath the first covenant thae that hae been invitit may receive the promise o eternal inheritance,and whan jesus saw him he said to him ye are simon johns son ye sal be cad cephas meanin a stane,1
5298,HEB,9,SCO1904,for whaur a covenant is it is necessar that a death soud come in on his side wha covenants,but eftir a hantle o quaistenin peter staunin up says to them men brethren ye a ken weel that a gey while syne god made wale amang us that the gentiles frae my mooth soud hear the blythemessage and believe,1
5299,HEB,9,SCO1904,for a covenant is made siccar eftir a death but it is o nae effeck while the covenanter leeves,een sae sal the son o man dree o them than the disciples begude to see that he spak to them o john the baptist,1
5300,HEB,9,SCO1904,and sae no een the first covenant was consecrate wantin blude,and he was castin oot a demon and it was a dumb ane,1
5301,HEB,9,SCO1904,for whan a the commauns war spoken conform tae the law by moses to the folk takin the blude o the cauves and the goats wi watir and scarlet oo and hyssop he strinklt baith the buik and a the folk sayin this is the blude o the covenant whilk god sent in commaun to you aye and the tabernacle as weel and a the veschels o the service strinklt he in like mainner wi the blude,and whan he had begude to reckon ane was brocht till him wha was awn him ten thoosan talents,1
5302,HEB,9,SCO1904,and narhaun a things are purifyt wi blude conform to the law and wantin the bludesheddin is nae remission,and brither wull gie up the brither to deid and the faither the bairn and bairns sal rise up again their parents that they be putten to death,1
5303,HEB,9,SCO1904,it was a necessity than for the imitations o things in heeven to be purifyt wi sic but the heevenlie things theirsels wi better sacrifeeces than thir,the day eftir when the folk staunin on the ither shore saw thar was nae boat tharaboot but the ane the disciples gaed intil and that jesus gaedna wi them intil the smack but that the disciples had gane awa by their sels hoosever thar cam ither boats frae tiberias narhaun the bit whaur they had breid eftir that the lord had gied thanks the folk tharfor seein that naither jesus nor his disciples war tharaboots took boat and cam till capernaum seekin for jesus,1
5304,HEB,9,SCO1904,for no intil holies madewihauns did christ gang in that war but figures o the true holies but intil heeven itsel noo to come plainly afore the face o god for us,jesus answert him it is he to wham i sal dip the morsel and gie it,1
5305,HEB,9,SCO1904,nor yet that afttimes soud he be offerin his sel like as the heighpriest enters the holieplace year by year wi ithers blude,a toon biggit on a hilltap is aye seen,1
5306,HEB,9,SCO1904,else had it been needfu for him aften to suffer frae the beginnin a the warld,but lat him turn awa frae the ill and do the gude let him seek peace and follow it,1
5307,HEB,9,SCO1904,but noo ance at the end o the time has he been schawn for the settinby o sin throwe his sacrifeece,to unsteek their een that they may turn them aboot frae the mirk intil the licht and frae sautans rule to god that they may hae their sins forgien and hae their lot amang them wha are sanctifyt by faith in me,1
5308,HEB,9,SCO1904,and inasmuckle as it is laid up for men ance to dee and eftir this the judgment sae christ haein ance for a been offert and carryt the sin o mony sal appear a second time apairt frae sin to thae that fain wait for him for their salvation,and jesus whan he was bapteezt gaed up straucht frae the watir and lo the heevens war unsteekit till him and he saw the spirit o god comin doon like a doo and lichtin upon him,1
5309,HEB,10,SCO1904,for the law wi a shadow o the gude things to come and no the perfete likeness o the things their sels canna wi thae sacrifeeces offert up year by year aye mak perfete them that draw nar,to save life or to slay,1
5310,HEB,10,SCO1904,for than wadna they quat bein offert,and anither angel came oot o the temple that was in heeven he too haein a shairp heuk,1
5311,HEB,10,SCO1904,for they worshippin bein ance for a purifyt wad hae nae mair conscience o sins but in them is a bringinback to mind o sins year by year,noo thar was a herd o mony swine feedin on the mountain and they entreatit him that he wad gie them leave to enter intil them,1
5312,HEB,10,SCO1904,impossible ist for blude o bulls and goats to tak awa sins whaurfor comin intil the warld he says sacrifeece and offeran thou willestna but a body didst thou prepare for me,and whan ye come intil a hoose salute it,1
5313,HEB,10,SCO1904,in hail bruntofferans and offerans for sins thou didstna joy than said i behauld i am come at the heid o the buik it is written o me to do thy wull o god aboon sayin sacrifeeces and offerans and haill bruntofferans and offerans for sin thou willestna naither didst joy in sic as conform to the law are offert than did he say behauld i am come to do thy wull he taks awa the first that he may mak siccar the second,and i hearkened to a soondin voice oot o the temple cryin to the seeven angels awa and teem oot the seeven flagons o the wrath o god on the yirth and the first gaed awa and teemed oot his flagon on the yirth and thar cam a waesome and sair blain on the men who had the brand o the beast and on thae giean worship to his image,1
5314,HEB,10,SCO1904,by the whilk wull we are made holie throwe the offerin o the body o jesus christ ance for a,and he gied orders that a soud sit doon banquetlike on the green gerss,1
5315,HEB,10,SCO1904,and ilka priest stauns in truth day eftir day servin and offerin ower again the same sacrifeeces whilk truly can never tak awa sins but he haein offert ae sacrifeece for sins for evermair sut doon at gods richt haun frae this waitin till his faes be made the fitbrod o his feet,and they wull worship him a they that dwall on the yirth ilk ane whase name isna puttendoon i the buikolife o the lamb that was slain frae the fundation o the warld,1
5316,HEB,10,SCO1904,for by the aeofferan he has perfetit for evermair them that are sanctifyt,for he wha said ye maunna commit adultery said as weel ye maunna commit murder,1
5317,HEB,10,SCO1904,and the holie spirit himsel bears witness for us for eftir he had said this is the covenant i wull covenant wi them eftir thae days says jehovah giean my laws on their hearts i wull write them on their minds he says mair their sins and their illdeediness wull i naewise mind ony mair,silly anes didna he wha made the ooter pairt mak the inner as weel,1
5318,HEB,10,SCO1904,noo whaursaeer they are remittit thar is nae mair offeran for sin needfu,and thar was gien to them ilk ane a white robe and it was tellt them that they soud rest their sels a wee while till their marrows and their brethren that soud be slain een as they war soud be a fulfilled,1
5319,HEB,10,SCO1904,haein than brethren bauldness o speech to enter intil the holiest by the blude o jesus whilk enterinin he has consecrate for us a new way and a way o life throwe the veil that is his flesh and haein sic a great heighpriest ower the hoosehauld o god lat us come nar wi leal hearts in the fu confidence o faith haein been strinklt in oor hearts frae an ill conscience and haein been wesht in oor bodies wi pure watir lat us haud siccar the confession o oor hope wi nae wafflin for leal is he that did undertak,noo he isna the god o deid men but o leevin for to him are a to leeve and some particular anes o the writers answert and quo they maister weel hae ye spoken for they daurna speir at him ony mair quaistens,1

5321,HEB,10,SCO1904,for gif we gang on sinnin eftir receivin the knowledge o the truth nae langer for sin is thar remainin a sacrifeece but a fearsome lookinforrit tae judgment and a sautness o fire that sal devoor the enemy,and sae staun beltit aboot the mids wi truth and haein put on the prufecoat o holiness and shod yere feet wi the readiness o the gudeword o peace and wi a takin up the shield o faith in whilk ye hae pooer to kep a the lowin shafts o the illane,1
