0,MAT,1,NRSV,an account of the genealogy of jesus the messiah the son of david the son of abraham,do your best to present yourself to god as one approved by him a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly explaining the word of truth,1
1,MAT,1,NRSV,abraham was the father of isaac and isaac the father of jacob and jacob the father of judah and his brothers and judah the father of perez and zerah by tamar and perez the father of hezron and hezron the father of aram and aram the father of aminadab and aminadab the father of nahshon and nahshon the father of salmon and salmon the father of boaz by rahab and boaz the father of obed by ruth and obed the father of jesse and jesse the father of king david,and i lay down my life for the sheep,1
2,MAT,1,NRSV,and david was the father of solomon by the wife of uriah and solomon the father of rehoboam and rehoboam the father of abijah and abijah the father of asaph and asaph the father of jehoshaphat and jehoshaphat the father of joram and joram the father of uzziah and uzziah the father of jotham and jotham the father of ahaz and ahaz the father of hezekiah and hezekiah the father of manasseh and manasseh the father of amos and amos the father of josiah and josiah the father of jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to babylon,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power,1
3,MAT,1,NRSV,and after the deportation to babylon jechoniah was the father of salathiel and salathiel the father of zerubbabel and zerubbabel the father of abiud and abiud the father of eliakim and eliakim the father of azor and azor the father of zadok and zadok the father of achim and achim the father of eliud and eliud the father of eleazar and eleazar the father of matthan and matthan the father of jacob and jacob the father of joseph the husband of mary of whom jesus was born who is called the messiah,unlike the other high priests he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for those of the people this he did once for all when he offered himself,1
4,MAT,1,NRSV,so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david to the deportation to babylon fourteen generations and from the deportation to babylon to the messiah fourteen generations,so there was great joy in that city,1
5,MAT,1,NRSV,now the birth of jesus the messiah took place in this way,it is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are virgins these follow the lamb wherever he goes,1
6,MAT,1,NRSV,when his mother mary had been engaged to joseph but before they lived together she was found to be with child from the holy spirit,when jesus saw nathanael coming toward him he said of him here is truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit nathanael asked him where did you get to know me,1
7,MAT,1,NRSV,her husband joseph being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace planned to dismiss her quietly,i will put my spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles,1
8,MAT,1,NRSV,but just when he had resolved to do this an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream and said joseph son of david do not be afraid to take mary as your wife for the child conceived in her is from the holy spirit,but they urged him strongly saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over,1
9,MAT,1,NRSV,she will bear a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins,our ancestors were unwilling to obey him instead they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to egypt saying to aaron make gods for us who will lead the way for us as for this moses who led us out from the land of egypt we do not know what has happened to him,1
10,MAT,1,NRSV,all this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet look the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall name him emmanuel which means god is with us,or again i will be his father and he will be my son,1
11,MAT,1,NRSV,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus,no you will be brought down to hades,1
12,MAT,2,NRSV,in the time of king herod after jesus was born in bethlehem of judea wise men from the east came to jerusalem asking where is the child who has been born king of the jews,above all clothe yourselves with love which binds everything together in perfect harmony,1
13,MAT,2,NRSV,for we observed his star at its rising and have come to pay him homage,they were trying to bring him in and lay him before jesus but finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the middle of the crowd in front of jesus,1
14,MAT,2,NRSV,when king herod heard this he was frightened and all jerusalem with him and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the messiah was to be born,for the son of man is lord of the sabbath,1
15,MAT,2,NRSV,they told him in bethlehem of judea for so it has been written by the prophet and you bethlehem in the land of judah are by no means least among the rulers of judah for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people israel,stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality,1
16,MAT,2,NRSV,then herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared,then the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son,1
17,MAT,2,NRSV,then he sent them to bethlehem saying go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word so that i may also go and pay him homage,you have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter,1
18,MAT,2,NRSV,when they had heard the king they set out and there ahead of them went the star that they had seen at its rising until it stopped over the place where the child was,so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily,1
19,MAT,2,NRSV,when they saw that the star had stopped they were overwhelmed with joy,since in her heart she says i rule as a queen i am no widow and i will never see grief therefore her plagues will come in a single day pestilence and mourning and famine and she will be burned with fire for mighty is the lord god who judges her,1
20,MAT,2,NRSV,on entering the house they saw the child with mary his mother and they knelt down and paid him homage,but when gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews made a united attack on paul and brought him before the tribunal,1
21,MAT,2,NRSV,then opening their treasure chests they offered him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh,so they went out and fled from the tomb for terror and amazement had seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid,1
22,MAT,2,NRSV,and having been warned in a dream not to return to herod they left for their own country by another road,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive,1
23,MAT,2,NRSV,now after they had left an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream and said get up take the child and his mother and flee to egypt and remain there until i tell you for herod is about to search for the child to destroy him,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened,1
24,MAT,2,NRSV,then joseph got up took the child and his mother by night and went to egypt and remained there until the death of herod,paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the tribune for he has something to report to him,1
25,MAT,2,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet out of egypt i have called my son,some fell among thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it,1
26,MAT,2,NRSV,when herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men he was infuriated and he sent and killed all the children in and around bethlehem who were two years old or under according to the time that he had learned from the wise men,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign,1
27,MAT,2,NRSV,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they are no more,for a tent was constructed the first one in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence this is called the holy place,1
28,MAT,2,NRSV,when herod died an angel of the lord suddenly appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt and said get up take the child and his mother and go to the land of israel for those who were seeking the childs life are dead,i urge euodia and i urge syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord,1
29,MAT,2,NRSV,then joseph got up took the child and his mother and went to the land of israel,yet none of you keeps the law,1
30,MAT,2,NRSV,but when he heard that archelaus was ruling over judea in place of his father herod he was afraid to go there,if i give away all my possessions and if i hand over my body so that i may boast but do not have love i gain nothing,1
31,MAT,2,NRSV,and after being warned in a dream he went away to the district of galilee,also it causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name,1
32,MAT,2,NRSV,there he made his home in a town called nazareth so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled he will be called a nazorean,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit,1
33,MAT,3,NRSV,in those days john the baptist appeared in the wilderness of judea proclaiming repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near,we set sail from troas and took a straight course to samothrace the following day to neapolis and from there to philippi which is a leading city of the district of macedonia and a roman colony,1
34,MAT,3,NRSV,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,1
35,MAT,3,NRSV,now john wore clothing of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and his food was locusts and wild honey,and many believed in him there,1
36,MAT,3,NRSV,then the people of jerusalem and all judea were going out to him and all the region along the jordan and they were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins,those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher,1
37,MAT,3,NRSV,but when he saw many pharisees and sadducees coming for baptism he said to them you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,jesus said to him if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,1
38,MAT,3,NRSV,do not presume to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,1
39,MAT,3,NRSV,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,she had heard about jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak for she said if i but touch his clothes i will be made well,1
40,MAT,3,NRSV,i baptize you with water for repentance but one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to carry his sandals,rid yourselves therefore of all malice and all guile insincerity envy and all slander,1
41,MAT,3,NRSV,he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire,here is a call for the endurance of the saints those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of jesus,1
42,MAT,3,NRSV,his winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,and the fact that the dead are raised moses himself showed in the story about the bush where he speaks of the lord as the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,1
43,MAT,3,NRSV,then jesus came from galilee to john at the jordan to be baptized by him,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction and there are many who take it,1
44,MAT,3,NRSV,john would have prevented him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me,on his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had become believers for he powerfully refuted the jews in public showing by the scriptures that the messiah is jesus,1
45,MAT,3,NRSV,but jesus answered him let it be so now for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness,live by the spirit i say and do not gratify the desires of the flesh,1
46,MAT,3,NRSV,and when jesus had been baptized just as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him,so they seized him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,1
47,MAT,3,NRSV,and a voice from heaven said this is my son the beloved with whom i am well pleased,in any case it was kind of you to share my distress,1
48,MAT,4,NRSV,then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil,but let us go to him,1
49,MAT,4,NRSV,he fasted forty days and forty nights and afterwards he was famished,for here we have no lasting city but we are looking for the city that is to come,1
50,MAT,4,NRSV,the tempter came and said to him if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread,then he will answer them truly i tell you just as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me,1
51,MAT,4,NRSV,but he answered it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven,1
52,MAT,4,NRSV,then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels concerning you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone,and he dismissed them from the tribunal,1
53,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus said to him again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test,philip went and told andrew then andrew and philip went and told jesus,1
54,MAT,4,NRSV,again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor and he said to him all these i will give you if you will fall down and worship me,above all maintain constant love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins,1
55,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus said to him away with you satan for it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,the angel replied i am gabriel,1
56,MAT,4,NRSV,then the devil left him and suddenly angels came and waited on him,indeed i myself was convinced that i ought to do many things against the name of jesus of nazareth,1
57,MAT,4,NRSV,now when jesus heard that john had been arrested he withdrew to galilee,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living,1
58,MAT,4,NRSV,he left nazareth and made his home in capernaum by the sea in the territory of zebulun and naphtali so that what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah might be fulfilled land of zebulun land of naphtali on the road by the sea across the jordan galilee of the gentiles the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned,do not move about from house to house,1
59,MAT,4,NRSV,from that time jesus began to proclaim repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name,1
60,MAT,4,NRSV,as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the seafor they were fishermen,or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk,1
61,MAT,4,NRSV,and he said to them follow me and i will make you fish for people,alexander the coppersmith did me great harm the lord will pay him back for his deeds,1
62,MAT,4,NRSV,immediately they left their nets and followed him,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before,1
63,MAT,4,NRSV,as he went from there he saw two other brothers james son of zebedee and his brother john in the boat with their father zebedee mending their nets and he called them,but jesus answered him let it be so now for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness,1
64,MAT,4,NRSV,immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him,and all the people who heard this including the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of god because they had been baptized with johns baptism,1
65,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people,but the one who endures to the end will be saved,1
66,MAT,4,NRSV,so his fame spread throughout all syria and they brought to him all the sick those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains demoniacs epileptics and paralytics and he cured them,but i say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister you will be liable to judgment and if you insult a brother or sister you will be liable to the council and if you say you fool you will be liable to the hell of fire,1
67,MAT,4,NRSV,and great crowds followed him from galilee the decapolis jerusalem judea and from beyond the jordan,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers,1
68,MAT,5,NRSV,when jesus saw the crowds he went up the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly,1
69,MAT,5,NRSV,then he began to speak and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,see i am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves,1
70,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity,1
71,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest,1
72,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled,and these are the ones sown on the good soil they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold,1
73,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the merciful for they will receive mercy,erastus the city treasurer and our brother quartus greet you,1
74,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the pure in heart for they will see god,he is not here but has risen,1
75,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god,a good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap for the measure you give will be the measure you get back,1
76,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive,1
77,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god,1
78,MAT,5,NRSV,rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you,but the word of god continued to advance and gain adherents,1
79,MAT,5,NRSV,you are the salt of the earth but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored,do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar,1
80,MAT,5,NRSV,it is no longer good for anything but is thrown out and trampled under foot,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone,1
81,MAT,5,NRSV,you are the light of the world,for this reason it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of abraham for he is the father of all of us as it is written i have made you the father of many nationsin the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist,1
82,MAT,5,NRSV,a city built on a hill cannot be hid,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was eager to do,1
83,MAT,5,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket but on the lampstand and it gives light to all in the house,do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the son of man will give you,1
84,MAT,5,NRSV,in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven,the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all this and they ridiculed him,1
85,MAT,5,NRSV,do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have come not to abolish but to fulfill,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,1
86,MAT,5,NRSV,for truly i tell you until heaven and earth pass away not one letter not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them,1
87,MAT,5,NRSV,therefore whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven,a second time he said to him simon son of john do you love me,1
88,MAT,5,NRSV,for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven,all have turned aside together they have become worthless there is no one who shows kindness there is not even one,1
89,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment,in any and all circumstances i have learned the secret of being wellfed and of going hungry of having plenty and of being in need,1
90,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister you will be liable to judgment and if you insult a brother or sister you will be liable to the council and if you say you fool you will be liable to the hell of fire,bring me a denarius and let me see it,1
91,MAT,5,NRSV,so when you are offering your gift at the altar if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you leave your gift there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother or sister and then come and offer your gift,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town,1
92,MAT,5,NRSV,come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him or your accuser may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you will be thrown into prison,while jesus went to the mount of olives,1
93,MAT,5,NRSV,truly i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the last penny,for here the saying holds true one sows and another reaps,1
94,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery,by no means although everyone is a liar let god be proved true as it is written so that you may be justified in your words and prevail in your judging,1
95,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart,whoever knows god listens to us and whoever is not from god does not listen to us,1
96,MAT,5,NRSV,if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell,then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory,1
97,MAT,5,NRSV,and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell,jesus said to them fill the jars with water,1
98,MAT,5,NRSV,it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce,for i do not do what i want but i do the very thing i hate,1
99,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1
100,MAT,5,NRSV,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,there are three that testify the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree,1
101,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king,i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them,1
102,MAT,5,NRSV,and do not swear by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black,when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they presented paul also before him,1
103,MAT,5,NRSV,let your word be yes yes or no no anything more than this comes from the evil one,to everyone who conquers i will give permission to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of god,1
104,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us,1
105,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you do not resist an evildoer,in fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures,1
106,MAT,5,NRSV,but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat give your cloak as well and if anyone forces you to go one mile go also the second mile,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,1
107,MAT,5,NRSV,give to everyone who begs from you and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you,you did not lie to us but to god now when ananias heard these words he fell down and died,1
108,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy,and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing,1
109,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be children of your father in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous,as it is written i have loved jacob but i have hated esau,1
110,MAT,5,NRSV,for if you love those who love you what reward do you have,do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,1
111,MAT,5,NRSV,do not even the tax collectors do the same,they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet,1
112,MAT,5,NRSV,and if you greet only your brothers and sisters what more are you doing than others,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food,1
113,MAT,5,NRSV,do not even the gentiles do the same,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law,1
114,MAT,5,NRSV,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect,see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven,1
115,MAT,6,NRSV,beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them for then you have no reward from your father in heaven,at once one of them ran and got a sponge filled it with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink,1
116,MAT,6,NRSV,so whenever you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be praised by others,now they know that everything you have given me is from you for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me,1
117,MAT,6,NRSV,truly i tell you they have received their reward,for i am not ashamed of the gospel it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and also to the greek,1
118,MAT,6,NRSV,but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your alms may be done in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you,then jesus said to them do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to galilee there they will see me,1
119,MAT,6,NRSV,and whenever you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners so that they may be seen by others,he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector,1
120,MAT,6,NRSV,truly i tell you they have received their reward,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,1
121,MAT,6,NRSV,but whenever you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you,but the woman knowing what had happened to her came in fear and trembling fell down before him and told him the whole truth,1
122,MAT,6,NRSV,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,by faith noah warned by god about events as yet unseen respected the warning and built an ark to save his household by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith,1
123,MAT,6,NRSV,do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him,what my father has given me is greater than all else and no one can snatch it out of the fathers hand,1
124,MAT,6,NRSV,pray then in this way our father in heaven hallowed be your name,moved with compassion jesus touched their eyes,1
125,MAT,6,NRSV,your will be done on earth as it is in heaven,he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire,1
126,MAT,6,NRSV,give us this day our daily bread,yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things took place,1
127,MAT,6,NRSV,and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors,after they had set a day to meet with him they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers,1
128,MAT,6,NRSV,and do not bring us to the time of trial but rescue us from the evil one,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory,1
129,MAT,6,NRSV,for if you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive others neither will your father forgive your trespasses,for whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope,1
130,MAT,6,NRSV,and whenever you fast do not look dismal like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting,when it was evening he came with the twelve,1
131,MAT,6,NRSV,truly i tell you they have received their reward,he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him can you see anything,1
132,MAT,6,NRSV,but when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you,and the beast that i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears and its mouth was like a lions mouth,1
133,MAT,6,NRSV,do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal,then he said to them the sabbath was made for humankind and not humankind for the sabbath so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath,1
134,MAT,6,NRSV,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also,so if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out,1
135,MAT,6,NRSV,the eye is the lamp of the body,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem,1
136,MAT,6,NRSV,so if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light but if your eye is unhealthy your whole body will be full of darkness,in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins,1
137,MAT,6,NRSV,if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other,and again here am i and the children whom god has given me,1
138,MAT,6,NRSV,you cannot serve god and wealth,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them,1
139,MAT,6,NRSV,therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will wear,yet the most high does not dwell in houses made with human hands as the prophet says heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool,1
140,MAT,6,NRSV,is not life more than food and the body more than clothing,she said to him declare that these two sons of mine will sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom,1
141,MAT,6,NRSV,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them,he said after i have gone there i must also see rome,1
142,MAT,6,NRSV,are you not of more value than they,for all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass,1
143,MAT,6,NRSV,and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man,1
144,MAT,6,NRSV,and why do you worry about clothing,but as it is they desire a better country that is a heavenly one,1
145,MAT,6,NRSV,consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing,1
146,MAT,6,NRSV,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe youyou of little faith,stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people,1
147,MAT,6,NRSV,therefore do not worry saying what will we eat,for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with him in the city and they supposed that paul had brought him into the temple,1
148,MAT,6,NRSV,for it is the gentiles who strive for all these things and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things,but this is your hour and the power of darkness then they seized him and led him away bringing him into the high priests house,1
149,MAT,6,NRSV,but strive first for the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well,for if they do this when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry,1
150,MAT,6,NRSV,so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring worries of its own,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh,1
151,MAT,6,NRSV,todays trouble is enough for today,thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins but gods wrath has overtaken them at last,1
152,MAT,7,NRSV,do not judge so that you may not be judged,then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus have you no answer,1
153,MAT,7,NRSV,for with the judgment you make you will be judged and the measure you give will be the measure you get,little children let no one deceive you,1
154,MAT,7,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons,1
155,MAT,7,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor let me take the speck out of your eye while the log is in your own eye,so we can say with confidence the lord is my helper i will not be afraid,1
156,MAT,7,NRSV,you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors eye,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them,1
157,MAT,7,NRSV,do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,1
158,MAT,7,NRSV,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree,1
159,MAT,7,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come,1
160,MAT,7,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,for to those who have more will be given and from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1
161,MAT,7,NRSV,or if the child asks for a fish will give a snake,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death,1
162,MAT,7,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him in everything do to others as you would have them do to you for this is the law and the prophets,he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son of whom he had been told it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you,1
163,MAT,7,NRSV,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction and there are many who take it,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,1
164,MAT,7,NRSV,for the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life and there are few who find it,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread,1
165,MAT,7,NRSV,beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves,they were asking for simons house and were standing by the gate,1
166,MAT,7,NRSV,you will know them by their fruits,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,1
167,MAT,7,NRSV,are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles,those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing,1
168,MAT,7,NRSV,in the same way every good tree bears good fruit but the bad tree bears bad fruit,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman,1
169,MAT,7,NRSV,a good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit,after greeting them he related one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry,1
170,MAT,7,NRSV,every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,then isaiah is so bold as to say i have been found by those who did not seek me i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me,1
171,MAT,7,NRSV,thus you will know them by their fruits,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food,1
172,MAT,7,NRSV,not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will of my father in heaven,and how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him,1
173,MAT,7,NRSV,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,she said to them they have taken away my lord and i do not know where they have laid him,1
174,MAT,7,NRSV,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends,1
175,MAT,7,NRSV,everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices,1
176,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on rock,let us not become conceited competing against one another envying one another,1
177,MAT,7,NRSV,and everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor,1
178,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it felland great was its fall now when jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as their scribes,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday,1
179,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him saying lord if you choose you can make me clean,as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet,1
180,MAT,8,NRSV,he stretched out his hand and touched him saying i do choose,and he said to them therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old,1
181,MAT,8,NRSV,be made clean immediately his leprosy was cleansed,who can forgive sins but god alone,1
182,MAT,8,NRSV,then jesus said to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded as a testimony to them,but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison doors brought them out and said go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life,1
183,MAT,8,NRSV,when he entered capernaum a centurion came to him appealing to him and saying lord my servant is lying at home paralyzed in terrible distress,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather,1
184,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to him i will come and cure him,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there they departed,1
185,MAT,8,NRSV,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed,he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his ancestor david,1
186,MAT,8,NRSV,for i also am a man under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it,i have become all things to all people that i might by all means save some,1
187,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus heard him he was amazed and said to those who followed him truly i tell you in no one in israel have i found such faith,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,1
188,MAT,8,NRSV,i tell you many will come from east and west and will eat with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,and that is what the soldiers did,1
189,MAT,8,NRSV,and to the centurion jesus said go let it be done for you according to your faith,but after they came he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction,1
190,MAT,8,NRSV,and the servant was healed in that hour,for who can resist his will,1
191,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus entered peters house he saw his motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to serve him,for christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes,1
192,MAT,8,NRSV,that evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and cured all who were sick,so i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours,1
193,MAT,8,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases,and after you have suffered for a little while the god of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself restore support strengthen and establish you,1
194,MAT,8,NRSV,now when jesus saw great crowds around him he gave orders to go over to the other side,why do you not understand what i say,1
195,MAT,8,NRSV,a scribe then approached and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,1
196,MAT,8,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head,the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask is this not the man who used to sit and beg,1
197,MAT,8,NRSV,another of his disciples said to him lord first let me go and bury my father,just as i have loved you you also should love one another,1
198,MAT,8,NRSV,but jesus said to him follow me and let the dead bury their own dead,then the pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said,1
199,MAT,8,NRSV,and when he got into the boat his disciples followed him,in the days of his flesh jesus offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission,1
200,MAT,8,NRSV,a windstorm arose on the sea so great that the boat was being swamped by the waves but he was asleep,just as they were leaving him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijahnot knowing what he said,1
201,MAT,8,NRSV,and they went and woke him up saying lord save us we are perishing and he said to them why are you afraid you of little faith,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place,1
202,MAT,8,NRSV,then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a dead calm,for once you were darkness but now in the lord you are light,1
203,MAT,8,NRSV,they were amazed saying what sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him,if you know these things you are blessed if you do them,1
204,MAT,8,NRSV,when he came to the other side to the country of the gadarenes two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,1
205,MAT,8,NRSV,they were so fierce that no one could pass that way,in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven,1
206,MAT,8,NRSV,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,1
207,MAT,8,NRSV,have you come here to torment us before the time,then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach,1
208,MAT,8,NRSV,now a large herd of swine was feeding at some distance from them,he answered an enemy has done this,1
209,MAT,8,NRSV,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine,he approached jesus to kiss him but jesus said to him judas is it with a kiss that you are betraying the son of man,1
210,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to them go so they came out and entered the swine and suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water,jesus said to him why do you call me good,1
211,MAT,8,NRSV,the swineherds ran off and on going into the town they told the whole story about what had happened to the demoniacs,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,1
212,MAT,8,NRSV,then the whole town came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they begged him to leave their neighborhood,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven,1
213,MAT,9,NRSV,and after getting into a boat he crossed the sea and came to his own town,yes says the spirit they will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them,1
214,MAT,9,NRSV,and just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed,he was in the beginning with god,1
215,MAT,9,NRSV,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic take heart son your sins are forgiven,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor,1
216,MAT,9,NRSV,then some of the scribes said to themselves this man is blaspheming,a windstorm swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in danger,1
217,MAT,9,NRSV,but jesus perceiving their thoughts said why do you think evil in your hearts,in this you rejoice even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more precious than gold that though perishable is tested by firemay be found to result in praise and glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed,1
218,MAT,9,NRSV,for which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and walk,welcome him then in the lord with all joy and honor such people because he came close to death for the work of christ risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me,1
219,MAT,9,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe then said to the paralyticstand up take your bed and go to your home,when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the slave in good health,1
220,MAT,9,NRSV,and he stood up and went to his home,but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to the emperoreven though i had no charge to bring against my nation,1
221,MAT,9,NRSV,when the crowds saw it they were filled with awe and they glorified god who had given such authority to human beings,when they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say for the holy spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say,1
222,MAT,9,NRSV,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,the real widow left alone has set her hope on god and continues in supplications and prayers night and day but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives,1
223,MAT,9,NRSV,and he got up and followed him,but jesus said to them you do not know what you are asking,1
224,MAT,9,NRSV,and as he sat at dinner in the house many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself so that where i am there you may be also,1
225,MAT,9,NRSV,when the pharisees saw this they said to his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners,indeed he has done nothing to deserve death,1
226,MAT,9,NRSV,but when he heard this he said those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become,1
227,MAT,9,NRSV,go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice,then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest,1
228,MAT,9,NRSV,for i have come to call not the righteous but sinners,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not,1
229,MAT,9,NRSV,then the disciples of john came to him saying why do we and the pharisees fast often but your disciples do not fast,i say this to your shame,1
230,MAT,9,NRSV,and jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them can they,when the seven days were almost completed the jews from asia who had seen him in the temple stirred up the whole crowd,1
231,MAT,9,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast,she said to the people come and see a man who told me everything i have ever done he cannot be the messiah can he,1
232,MAT,9,NRSV,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak for the patch pulls away from the cloak and a worse tear is made,but no one can enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man then indeed the house can be plundered,1
233,MAT,9,NRSV,neither is new wine put into old wineskins otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed but new wine is put into fresh wineskins and so both are preserved,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,1
234,MAT,9,NRSV,while he was saying these things to them suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him saying my daughter has just died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live,what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him,1
235,MAT,9,NRSV,and jesus got up and followed him with his disciples,their condemnation is deserved what then,1
236,MAT,9,NRSV,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well,but if i have spoken rightly why do you strike me,1
237,MAT,9,NRSV,jesus turned and seeing her he said take heart daughter your faith has made you well,now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of services but the same lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone,1
238,MAT,9,NRSV,and instantly the woman was made well,let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those authorities that exist have been instituted by god,1
239,MAT,9,NRSV,when jesus came to the leaders house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion he said go away for the girl is not dead but sleeping,then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,1
240,MAT,9,NRSV,but when the crowd had been put outside he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up,these are the things you must insist on and teach,1
241,MAT,9,NRSV,and the report of this spread throughout that district,whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses,1
242,MAT,9,NRSV,as jesus went on from there two blind men followed him crying loudly have mercy on us son of david when he entered the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them do you believe that i am able to do this,and i know that such a personwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows was caught up into paradise and heard things that are not to be told that no mortal is permitted to repeat,1
243,MAT,9,NRSV,they said to him yes lord,the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord,1
244,MAT,9,NRSV,then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done to you,jesus said to them if you were blind you would not have sin,1
245,MAT,9,NRSV,then jesus sternly ordered them see that no one knows of this,it is to peace that god has called you,1
246,MAT,9,NRSV,but they went away and spread the news about him throughout that district,so he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,1
247,MAT,9,NRSV,after they had gone away a demoniac who was mute was brought to him,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,1
248,MAT,9,NRSV,and when the demon had been cast out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed and said never has anything like this been seen in israel,so i do not run aimlessly nor do i box as though beating the air but i punish my body and enslave it so that after proclaiming to others i myself should not be disqualified,1
249,MAT,9,NRSV,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons,i went up in response to a revelation,1
250,MAT,9,NRSV,then jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness,when evening came he was there alone but by this time the boat battered by the waves was far from the land for the wind was against them,1
251,MAT,9,NRSV,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd,and after paul and barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them paul and barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders,1
252,MAT,9,NRSV,then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest,he must increase but i must decrease,1
253,MAT,10,NRSV,then jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to cure every disease and every sickness,when they realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowd,1
254,MAT,10,NRSV,these are the names of the twelve apostles first simon also known as peter and his brother andrew james son of zebedee and his brother john philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus simon the cananaean and judas iscariot the one who betrayed him,is not this the carpenters son,1
255,MAT,10,NRSV,these twelve jesus sent out with the following instructions go nowhere among the gentiles and enter no town of the samaritans but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel,i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind just as the testimony of christ has been strengthened among you so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ,1
256,MAT,10,NRSV,as you go proclaim the good news the kingdom of heaven has come near,we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ,1
257,MAT,10,NRSV,cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out demons,he said to them is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket or under the bed and not on the lampstand,1
258,MAT,10,NRSV,you received without payment give without payment,how can you want to be enslaved to them again,1
259,MAT,10,NRSV,take no gold or silver or copper in your belts no bag for your journey or two tunics or sandals or a staff for laborers deserve their food,since i am convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith so that i may share abundantly in your boasting in christ jesus when i come to you again,1
260,MAT,10,NRSV,whatever town or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah remains forever,1
261,MAT,10,NRSV,as you enter the house greet it,they had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands,1
262,MAT,10,NRSV,if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat,1
263,MAT,10,NRSV,if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town,he said i do not know,1
264,MAT,10,NRSV,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,peter said to him aeneas jesus christ heals you get up and make your bed and immediately he got up,1
265,MAT,10,NRSV,see i am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves,like obedient children do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance,1
266,MAT,10,NRSV,beware of them for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them and the gentiles,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,1
267,MAT,10,NRSV,when they hand you over do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say for what you are to say will be given to you at that time for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,1
268,MAT,10,NRSV,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name,the jews then said this temple has been under construction for fortysix years and will you raise it up in three days,1
269,MAT,10,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money,1
270,MAT,10,NRSV,when they persecute you in one town flee to the next for truly i tell you you will not have gone through all the towns of israel before the son of man comes,the disciples went and did as jesus had directed them they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and he sat on them,1
271,MAT,10,NRSV,a disciple is not above the teacher nor a slave above the master it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher and the slave like the master,he answered here i am lord,1
272,MAT,10,NRSV,if they have called the master of the house beelzebul how much more will they malign those of his household so have no fear of them for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret,1
273,MAT,10,NRSV,what i say to you in the dark tell in the light and what you hear whispered proclaim from the housetops,when judas his betrayer saw that jesus was condemned he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,1
274,MAT,10,NRSV,do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell,no you will be brought down to hades,1
275,MAT,10,NRSV,are not two sparrows sold for a penny,should we sin because we are not under law but under grace,1
276,MAT,10,NRSV,yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan,1
277,MAT,10,NRSV,and even the hairs of your head are all counted,and again i will put my trust in him,1
278,MAT,10,NRSV,so do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows,and when he comes he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment about sin because they do not believe in me about righteousness because i am going to the father and you will see me no longer about judgment because the ruler of this world has been condemned,1
279,MAT,10,NRSV,everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others i also will acknowledge before my father in heaven but whoever denies me before others i also will deny before my father in heaven,he must not be a recent convert or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil,1
280,MAT,10,NRSV,do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth i have not come to bring peace but a sword,but now they have seen and hated both me and my father,1
281,MAT,10,NRSV,for i have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw and ones foes will be members of ones own household,then what advantage has the jew,1
282,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like,1
283,MAT,10,NRSV,those who find their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it,we went ahead to the ship and set sail for assos intending to take paul on board there for he had made this arrangement intending to go by land himself,1
284,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me,he said the one who showed him mercy,1
285,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a discipletruly i tell you none of these will lose their reward,you that forbid adultery do you commit adultery,1
286,MAT,11,NRSV,now when jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and proclaim his message in their cities,now there came to ephesus a jew named apollos a native of alexandria,1
287,MAT,11,NRSV,when john heard in prison what the messiah was doing he sent word by his disciples and said to him are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another,but the one to whom little is forgiven loves little,1
288,MAT,11,NRSV,jesus answered them go and tell john what you hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have good news brought to them,for you were going astray like sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls,1
289,MAT,11,NRSV,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me,but jesus said let her alone why do you trouble her,1
290,MAT,11,NRSV,as they went away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at,come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him or your accuser may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you will be thrown into prison,1
291,MAT,11,NRSV,a reed shaken by the wind,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets,1
292,MAT,11,NRSV,what then did you go out to see,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him,1
293,MAT,11,NRSV,look those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces,ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete,1
294,MAT,11,NRSV,what then did you go out to see,but there were some jews from asiathey ought to be here before you to make an accusation if they have anything against me,1
295,MAT,11,NRSV,yes i tell you and more than a prophet,the head was brought on a platter and given to the girl who brought it to her mother,1
296,MAT,11,NRSV,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you,blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection,1
297,MAT,11,NRSV,truly i tell you among those born of women no one has arisen greater than john the baptist yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction,1
298,MAT,11,NRSV,from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,1
299,MAT,11,NRSV,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john came and if you are willing to accept it he is elijah who is to come,believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me but if you do not then believe me because of the works themselves,1
300,MAT,11,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen but to what will i compare this generation,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,1
301,MAT,11,NRSV,it is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not mourn,i can testify that they have a zeal for god but it is not enlightened,1
302,MAT,11,NRSV,for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and they say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds,then certain individuals came down from judea and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved,1
303,MAT,11,NRSV,then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done because they did not repent,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare,1
304,MAT,11,NRSV,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes,to him be the glory forever,1
305,MAT,11,NRSV,but i tell you on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you,when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they realized that he was speaking about them,1
306,MAT,11,NRSV,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven,the one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them and made five more talents,1
307,MAT,11,NRSV,no you will be brought down to hades,if the work is burned up the builder will suffer loss the builder will be saved but only as through fire,1
308,MAT,11,NRSV,for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day,do all possess gifts of healing,1
309,MAT,11,NRSV,but i tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom than for you,they said where did this man get all this,1
310,MAT,11,NRSV,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,everyone who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous,1
311,MAT,11,NRSV,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him,he listened to paul as he was speaking,1
312,MAT,11,NRSV,come to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens and i will give you rest,that is to bring christ up from the dead,1
313,MAT,11,NRSV,take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls,in the presence of god and of christ jesus and of the elect angels i warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice doing nothing on the basis of partiality,1
314,MAT,11,NRSV,for my yoke is easy and my burden is light,then the scribes and the pharisees began to question who is this who is speaking blasphemies,1
315,MAT,12,NRSV,at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples were hungry and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat,then some boats from tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the lord had given thanks,1
316,MAT,12,NRSV,when the pharisees saw it they said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath,for this reason they are before the throne of god and worship him day and night within his temple and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them,1
317,MAT,12,NRSV,he said to them have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,then he put them all outside and took the childs father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was,1
318,MAT,12,NRSV,he entered the house of god and ate the bread of the presence which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat but only for the priests,but i tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom than for you,1
319,MAT,12,NRSV,or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless,he will glorify me because he will take what is mine and declare it to you,1
320,MAT,12,NRSV,i tell you something greater than the temple is here,and there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be scorned and she will be deprived of her majesty that brought all asia and the world to worship her,1
321,MAT,12,NRSV,but if you had known what this means i desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless,on account of these the wrath of god is coming on those who are disobedient,1
322,MAT,12,NRSV,for the son of man is lord of the sabbath,his disciples said to him if such is the case of a man with his wife it is better not to marry,1
323,MAT,12,NRSV,he left that place and entered their synagogue a man was there with a withered hand and they asked him is it lawful to cure on the sabbath,if they say look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it,1
324,MAT,12,NRSV,so that they might accuse him,let anyone who has an ear listen if you are to be taken captive into captivity you go if you kill with the sword with the sword you must be killed,1
325,MAT,12,NRSV,he said to them suppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath will you not lay hold of it and lift it out,for to begin with when you come together as a church i hear that there are divisions among you and to some extent i believe it,1
326,MAT,12,NRSV,how much more valuable is a human being than a sheep so it is lawful to do good on the sabbath,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed,1
327,MAT,12,NRSV,then he said to the man stretch out your hand,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1
328,MAT,12,NRSV,he stretched it out and it was restored as sound as the other,this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son,1
329,MAT,12,NRSV,but the pharisees went out and conspired against him how to destroy him,so they asked pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed,1
330,MAT,12,NRSV,when jesus became aware of this he departed,isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him,1
331,MAT,12,NRSV,many crowds followed him and he cured all of them and he ordered them not to make him known,zacchaeus stood there and said to the lord look half of my possessions lord i will give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i will pay back four times as much,1
332,MAT,12,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah here is my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire,1
333,MAT,12,NRSV,i will put my spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles,when silas and timothy arrived from macedonia paul was occupied with proclaiming the word testifying to the jews that the messiah was jesus,1
334,MAT,12,NRSV,he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets,so the jews said to the man who had been cured it is the sabbath it is not lawful for you to carry your mat,1
335,MAT,12,NRSV,he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory,and we bring you the good news that what god promised to our ancestors he has fulfilled for us their children by raising jesus as also it is written in the second psalm you are my son today i have begotten you,1
336,MAT,12,NRSV,and in his name the gentiles will hope,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,1
337,MAT,12,NRSV,then they brought to him a demoniac who was blind and mute and he cured him so that the one who had been mute could speak and see,just then in front of him there was a man who had dropsy,1
338,MAT,12,NRSV,all the crowds were amazed and said can this be the son of david,if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell,1
339,MAT,12,NRSV,but when the pharisees heard it they said it is only by beelzebul the ruler of the demons that this fellow casts out the demons,jesus said to them come and have breakfast,1
340,MAT,12,NRSV,he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will stand,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,1
341,MAT,12,NRSV,if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand,in the same way husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies,1
342,MAT,12,NRSV,if i cast out demons by beelzebul by whom do your own exorcists cast them out,let anyone be accursed who has no love for the lord,1
343,MAT,12,NRSV,therefore they will be your judges,grace be with all of you,1
344,MAT,12,NRSV,but if it is by the spirit of god that i cast out demons then the kingdom of god has come to you,he said after i have gone there i must also see rome,1
345,MAT,12,NRSV,or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man,do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have come not to abolish but to fulfill,1
346,MAT,12,NRSV,then indeed the house can be plundered,my father is glorified by this that you bear much fruit and become my disciples,1
347,MAT,12,NRSV,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters,i have decided what to do so that when i am dismissed as manager people may welcome me into their homes,1
348,MAT,12,NRSV,therefore i tell you people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given,1
349,MAT,12,NRSV,whoever speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come,pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers,1
350,MAT,12,NRSV,either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for the tree is known by its fruit,they replied we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish,1
351,MAT,12,NRSV,you brood of vipers how can you speak good things when you are evil,on either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit producing its fruit each month and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations,1
352,MAT,12,NRSV,for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak for the patch pulls away from the cloak and a worse tear is made,1
353,MAT,12,NRSV,the good person brings good things out of a good treasure and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure,but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return,1
354,MAT,12,NRSV,i tell you on the day of judgment you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned,greet those workers in the lord tryphaena and tryphosa,1
355,MAT,12,NRSV,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,and they brought the boy to him,1
356,MAT,12,NRSV,but he answered them an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet jonah,and now your relative elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren,1
357,MAT,12,NRSV,for just as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster so for three days and three nights the son of man will be in the heart of the earth,i say this to your shame,1
358,MAT,12,NRSV,the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here the queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but it finds none,fear came over all their neighbors and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of judea,1
359,MAT,12,NRSV,then it says i will return to my house from which i came,while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servantgirls of the high priest came by,1
360,MAT,12,NRSV,when it comes it finds it empty swept and put in order,love is patient love is kind love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude,1
361,MAT,12,NRSV,then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first,while some were saying he is a good man others were saying no he is deceiving the crowd,1
362,MAT,12,NRSV,so will it be also with this evil generation,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well,1
363,MAT,12,NRSV,while he was still speaking to the crowds his mother and his brothers were standing outside wanting to speak to him,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,1
364,MAT,12,NRSV,someone told him look your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life,1
365,MAT,12,NRSV,but to the one who had told him this jesus replied who is my mother and who are my brothers,but we appeal to you brothers and sisters to respect those who labor among you and have charge of you in the lord and admonish you esteem them very highly in love because of their work,1
366,MAT,12,NRSV,and pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother,blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh,1
367,MAT,13,NRSV,that same day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea,but they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified and their voices prevailed,1
368,MAT,13,NRSV,such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the whole crowd stood on the beach,no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us,1
369,MAT,13,NRSV,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light,1
370,MAT,13,NRSV,and as he sowed some seeds fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles,1
371,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and they sprang up quickly since they had no depth of soil,they marched up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,1
372,MAT,13,NRSV,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away,thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god,1
373,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god,1
374,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1
375,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen then the disciples came and asked him why do you speak to them in parables,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe,1
376,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given,jesus said to him go your son will live,1
377,MAT,13,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him,1
378,MAT,13,NRSV,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand,after jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum,1
379,MAT,13,NRSV,with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah that says you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive,since he was a prophet he knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne,1
380,MAT,13,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,and he ordered him to tell no one,1
381,MAT,13,NRSV,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name,1
382,MAT,13,NRSV,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,and jesus said to her woman what concern is that to you and to me,1
383,MAT,13,NRSV,hear then the parable of the sower,as he walked along he saw a man blind from birth,1
384,MAT,13,NRSV,when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path,now i would remind you brothers and sisters of the good news that i proclaimed to you which you in turn received in which also you stand through which also you are being saved if you hold firmly to the message that i proclaimed to youunless you have come to believe in vain,1
385,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away,if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords,1
386,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb,1
387,MAT,13,NRSV,but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty,then they said to him what must we do to perform the works of god,1
388,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away,he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might come to have first place in everything,1
389,MAT,13,NRSV,so when the plants came up and bore grain then the weeds appeared as well,with this in mind i was traveling to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests when at midday along the road your excellency i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions,1
390,MAT,13,NRSV,and the slaves of the householder came and said to him master did you not sow good seed in your field,when the angel who spoke to him had left he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him and after telling them everything he sent them to joppa,1
391,MAT,13,NRSV,where then did these weeds come from,yet if you say so i will let down the nets,1
392,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered an enemy has done this,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,1
393,MAT,13,NRSV,the slaves said to him then do you want us to go and gather them,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught,1
394,MAT,13,NRSV,but he replied no for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them,and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb great and amazing are your deeds lord god the almighty just and true are your ways king of the nations lord who will not fear and glorify your name,1
395,MAT,13,NRSV,let both of them grow together until the harvest and at harvest time i will tell the reapers collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn,look the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out,1
396,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches,if timothy comes see that he has nothing to fear among you for he is doing the work of the lord just as i am therefore let no one despise him,1
397,MAT,13,NRSV,he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil,1
398,MAT,13,NRSV,jesus told the crowds all these things in parables without a parable he told them nothing,they said moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,1
399,MAT,13,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet i will open my mouth to speak in parables i will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world,pilate asked him what is truth,1
400,MAT,13,NRSV,then he left the crowds and went into the house,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning,1
401,MAT,13,NRSV,and his disciples approached him saying explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified,1
402,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered the one who sows the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels,when they asked him to stay longer he declined but on taking leave of them he said i will return to you if god wills,1
403,MAT,13,NRSV,just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age,and he did the same with the cup after supper saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood,1
404,MAT,13,NRSV,the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers and they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison,1
405,MAT,13,NRSV,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father,for who can resist his will,1
406,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,so whenever you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be praised by others,1
407,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it,first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone for kings and all who are in high positions so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity,1
408,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind when it was full they drew it ashore sat down and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well,1
409,MAT,13,NRSV,so it will be at the end of the age,and the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,1
410,MAT,13,NRSV,the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,1
411,MAT,13,NRSV,and he said to them therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore,1
412,MAT,13,NRSV,when jesus had finished these parables he left that place,pilate asked him what is truth,1
413,MAT,13,NRSV,he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power,they who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me and those who love me will be loved by my father and i will love them and reveal myself to them,1
414,MAT,13,NRSV,is not this the carpenters son,a jar full of sour wine was standing there,1
415,MAT,13,NRSV,is not his mother called mary,he was trying to see who jesus was but on account of the crowd he could not because he was short in stature,1
416,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee,1
417,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not all his sisters with us,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love,1
418,MAT,13,NRSV,where then did this man get all this,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1
419,MAT,13,NRSV,and they took offense at him,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death,1
420,MAT,13,NRSV,but jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years,1
421,MAT,13,NRSV,and he did not do many deeds of power there because of their unbelief,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him,1
422,MAT,14,NRSV,at that time herod the ruler heard reports about jesus and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him,do not repay anyone evil for evil but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all,1
423,MAT,14,NRSV,for herod had arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because john had been telling him it is not lawful for you to have her,the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep,1
424,MAT,14,NRSV,though herod wanted to put him to death he feared the crowd because they regarded him as a prophet,but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk,1
425,MAT,14,NRSV,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask,and jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,1
426,MAT,14,NRSV,prompted by her mother she said give me the head of john the baptist here on a platter,jesus said to him have i been with you all this time philip and you still do not know me,1
427,MAT,14,NRSV,the king was grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he commanded it to be given he sent and had john beheaded in the prison,then a voice came from heaven i have glorified it and i will glorify it again,1
428,MAT,14,NRSV,the head was brought on a platter and given to the girl who brought it to her mother,this king melchizedek of salem priest of the most high god met abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him and to him abraham apportioned onetenth of everything,1
429,MAT,14,NRSV,his disciples came and took the body and buried it then they went and told jesus,then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory,1
430,MAT,14,NRSV,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself,you are witnesses and god also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was toward you believers,1
431,MAT,14,NRSV,but when the crowds heard it they followed him on foot from the towns,after he saw that it pleased the jews he proceeded to arrest peter also,1
432,MAT,14,NRSV,when he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them and cured their sick,recalling your tears i long to see you so that i may be filled with joy,1
433,MAT,14,NRSV,when it was evening the disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way,1
434,MAT,14,NRSV,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat,and you became imitators of us and of the lord for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the holy spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia,1
435,MAT,14,NRSV,they replied we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish,so let us not grow weary in doing what is right for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up,1
436,MAT,14,NRSV,and he said bring them here to me,his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow,1
437,MAT,14,NRSV,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,until now you have not asked for anything in my name,1
438,MAT,14,NRSV,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever,1
439,MAT,14,NRSV,and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full,let it be assumed that i did not burden you,1
440,MAT,14,NRSV,and those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children,when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put an end to childish ways,1
441,MAT,14,NRSV,immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he dismissed the crowds,you that forbid adultery do you commit adultery,1
442,MAT,14,NRSV,and after he had dismissed the crowds he went up the mountain by himself to pray,then they remembered his words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest,1
443,MAT,14,NRSV,when evening came he was there alone but by this time the boat battered by the waves was far from the land for the wind was against them,then i saw another beast that rose out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon,1
444,MAT,14,NRSV,and early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea,then jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe,1
445,MAT,14,NRSV,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear,do not be astonished brothers and sisters that the world hates you,1
446,MAT,14,NRSV,but immediately jesus spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid,all mine are yours and yours are mine and i have been glorified in them,1
447,MAT,14,NRSV,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water,but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience,1
448,MAT,14,NRSV,so peter got out of the boat started walking on the water and came toward jesus,after sending away the crowds he got into the boat and went to the region of magadan,1
449,MAT,14,NRSV,but when he noticed the strong wind he became frightened and beginning to sink he cried out lord save me jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him saying to him you of little faith why did you doubt,while he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you but he said blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it when the crowds were increasing he began to say this generation is an evil generation it asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah,1
450,MAT,14,NRSV,when they got into the boat the wind ceased,then the one who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more talents saying master you handed over to me five talents see i have made five more talents,1
451,MAT,14,NRSV,and those in the boat worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god,if my kingdom were from this world my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the jews,1
452,MAT,14,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret,she has done what she could she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial,1
453,MAT,14,NRSV,after the people of that place recognized him they sent word throughout the region and brought all who were sick to him and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed,be on your guard if another disciple sins you must rebuke the offender and if there is repentance you must forgive,1
454,MAT,15,NRSV,then pharisees and scribes came to jesus from jerusalem and said why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders,they bound jesus led him away and handed him over to pilate,1
455,MAT,15,NRSV,for they do not wash their hands before they eat,then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them rulers of the people and elders if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed let it be known to all of you and to all the people of israel that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead,1
456,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered them and why do you break the commandment of god for the sake of your tradition,then from the smoke came locusts on the earth and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth,1
457,MAT,15,NRSV,for god said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1
458,MAT,15,NRSV,but you say that whoever tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is given to god then that person need not honor the father,after being baptized he stayed constantly with philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place,1
459,MAT,15,NRSV,so for the sake of your tradition you make void the word of god,among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joseph and the mother of the sons of zebedee,1
460,MAT,15,NRSV,you hypocrites isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said this people honors me with their lips but their hearts are far from me in vain do they worship me teaching human precepts as doctrines,for you may give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up,1
461,MAT,15,NRSV,then he called the crowd to him and said to them listen and understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles,for just as by the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one mans obedience the many will be made righteous,1
462,MAT,15,NRSV,then the disciples approached and said to him do you know that the pharisees took offense when they heard what you said,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,1
463,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be uprooted,when they had come opposite mysia they attempted to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus did not allow them so passing by mysia they went down to troas,1
464,MAT,15,NRSV,let them alone they are blind guides of the blind,now a man called barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection,1
465,MAT,15,NRSV,and if one blind person guides another both will fall into a pit,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did,1
466,MAT,15,NRSV,but peter said to him explain this parable to us,they put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head,1
467,MAT,15,NRSV,then he said are you also still without understanding,at once one of them ran and got a sponge filled it with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink,1
468,MAT,15,NRSV,do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer,come to a sober and right mind and sin no more for some people have no knowledge of god,1
469,MAT,15,NRSV,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying,1
470,MAT,15,NRSV,for out of the heart come evil intentions murder adultery fornication theft false witness slander,the sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up and every mountain and island was removed from its place,1
471,MAT,15,NRSV,these are what defile a person but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile,he said after i have gone there i must also see rome,1
472,MAT,15,NRSV,jesus left that place and went away to the district of tyre and sidon,and he said to the man who had the withered hand come forward,1
473,MAT,15,NRSV,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,then he called the crowd to him and said to them listen and understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles,1
474,MAT,15,NRSV,but he did not answer her at all,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years,1
475,MAT,15,NRSV,and his disciples came and urged him saying send her away for she keeps shouting after us,for by the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has assigned,1
476,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel,but of israel he says all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people,1
477,MAT,15,NRSV,but she came and knelt before him saying lord help me,the woman said to him i know that messiah is coming who is called christ,1
478,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,1
479,MAT,15,NRSV,she said yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table,and whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne who lives forever and ever the twentyfour elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever they cast their crowns before the throne singing you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they existed and were created,1
480,MAT,15,NRSV,then jesus answered her woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish,but abraham said child remember that during your lifetime you received your good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony,1
481,MAT,15,NRSV,and her daughter was healed instantly,and great fear seized all who heard of it,1
482,MAT,15,NRSV,after jesus had left that place he passed along the sea of galilee and he went up the mountain where he sat down,but peter said to him explain this parable to us,1
483,MAT,15,NRSV,great crowds came to him bringing with them the lame the maimed the blind the mute and many others,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1
484,MAT,15,NRSV,they put them at his feet and he cured them so that the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking the maimed whole the lame walking and the blind seeing,but to detain you no further i beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness,1
485,MAT,15,NRSV,and they praised the god of israel,when jesus had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him saying lord if you choose you can make me clean,1
486,MAT,15,NRSV,then jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat and i do not want to send them away hungry for they might faint on the way,after sending away the crowds he got into the boat and went to the region of magadan,1
487,MAT,15,NRSV,the disciples said to him where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd,but the tax collector standing far off would not even look up to heaven but was beating his breast and saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his home justified rather than the other for all who exalt themselves will be humbled but all who humble themselves will be exalted,1
488,MAT,15,NRSV,jesus asked them how many loaves have you,god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth,1
489,MAT,15,NRSV,they said seven and a few small fish,for it is indeed just of god to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus,1
490,MAT,15,NRSV,then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground he took the seven loaves and the fish and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds,aquila and prisca together with the church in their house greet you warmly in the lord,1
491,MAT,15,NRSV,and all of them ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full,after spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of galatia and phrygia strengthening all the disciples,1
492,MAT,15,NRSV,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children,but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written,1
493,MAT,15,NRSV,after sending away the crowds he got into the boat and went to the region of magadan,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets,1
494,MAT,16,NRSV,the pharisees and sadducees came and to test jesus they asked him to show them a sign from heaven,and just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life,1
495,MAT,16,NRSV,he answered them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat,1
496,MAT,16,NRSV,and in the morning it will be stormy today for the sky is red and threatening,and they began saluting him hail king of the jews they struck his head with a reed spat upon him and knelt down in homage to him,1
497,MAT,16,NRSV,you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times,as it is there are many members yet one body,1
498,MAT,16,NRSV,an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah,you are aware that all who are in asia have turned away from me including phygelus and hermogenes,1
499,MAT,16,NRSV,then he left them and went away,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray,1
500,MAT,16,NRSV,when the disciples reached the other side they had forgotten to bring any bread,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank,1
501,MAT,16,NRSV,jesus said to them watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees,do i make my plans according to ordinary human standards ready to say yes yes and no no at the same time,1
502,MAT,16,NRSV,they said to one another it is because we have brought no bread,he kept saying i am the man,1
503,MAT,16,NRSV,and becoming aware of it jesus said you of little faith why are you talking about having no bread,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,1
504,MAT,16,NRSV,do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered,he said abba father for you all things are possible remove this cup from me yet not what i want but what you want,1
505,MAT,16,NRSV,or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered,he was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light,1
506,MAT,16,NRSV,how could you fail to perceive that i was not speaking about bread,so they kept the matter to themselves questioning what this rising from the dead could mean,1
507,MAT,16,NRSV,beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of bread but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,1
508,MAT,16,NRSV,now when jesus came into the district of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples who do people say that the son of man is,so you have pain now but i will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take your joy from you,1
509,MAT,16,NRSV,and they said some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets,as he was now approaching the path down from the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise god joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen saying blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven some of the pharisees in the crowd said to him teacher order your disciples to stop,1
510,MAT,16,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am,and when they could not bring him to jesus because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and after having dug through it they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay,1
511,MAT,16,NRSV,simon peter answered you are the messiah the son of the living god,and all in the crowd were trying to touch him for power came out from him and healed all of them,1
512,MAT,16,NRSV,and jesus answered him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven,so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,1
513,MAT,16,NRSV,and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it,keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,1
514,MAT,16,NRSV,i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,he replied my name is legion for we are many,1
515,MAT,16,NRSV,then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah,in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan,1
516,MAT,16,NRSV,from that time on jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,not that i am referring to being in need for i have learned to be content with whatever i have,1
517,MAT,16,NRSV,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying god forbid it lord this must never happen to you,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,1
518,MAT,16,NRSV,but he turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,he said to them strive to enter through the narrow door for many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able,1
519,MAT,16,NRSV,then jesus told his disciples if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me,his mother treasured all these things in her heart,1
520,MAT,16,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it,if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven them if you retain the sins of any they are retained,1
521,MAT,16,NRSV,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life,jesus said to her do not hold on to me because i have not yet ascended to the father,1
522,MAT,16,NRSV,or what will they give in return for their life,so they were sent off and went down to antioch,1
523,MAT,16,NRSV,for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay everyone for what has been done,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight,1
524,MAT,16,NRSV,truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom,the angel replied i am gabriel,1
525,MAT,17,NRSV,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and his brother john and led them up a high mountain by themselves,for the promise is for you for your children and for all who are far away everyone whom the lord our god calls to him,1
526,MAT,17,NRSV,and he was transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became dazzling white,whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a discipletruly i tell you none of these will lose their reward,1
527,MAT,17,NRSV,suddenly there appeared to them moses and elijah talking with him,whatever town or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave,1
528,MAT,17,NRSV,then peter said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you wish i will make three dwellings here one for you one for moses and one for elijah,whoever serves me the father will honor,1
529,MAT,17,NRSV,while he was still speaking suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud a voice said this is my son the beloved with him i am well pleased listen to him when the disciples heard this they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1
530,MAT,17,NRSV,but jesus came and touched them saying get up and do not be afraid,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
531,MAT,17,NRSV,and when they looked up they saw no one except jesus himself alone,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town,1
532,MAT,17,NRSV,as they were coming down the mountain jesus ordered them tell no one about the vision until after the son of man has been raised from the dead,therefore be alert remembering that for three years i did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears,1
533,MAT,17,NRSV,and the disciples asked him why then do the scribes say that elijah must come first,but when they had tied him up with thongs paul said to the centurion who was standing by is it legal for you to flog a roman citizen who is uncondemned,1
534,MAT,17,NRSV,he replied elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things but i tell you that elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but they did to him whatever they pleased,on that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you,1
535,MAT,17,NRSV,so also the son of man is about to suffer at their hands,this is now beloved the second letter i am writing to you in them i am trying to arouse your sincere intention by reminding you that you should remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of the lord and savior spoken through your apostles,1
536,MAT,17,NRSV,then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about john the baptist,and when he comes he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment about sin because they do not believe in me about righteousness because i am going to the father and you will see me no longer about judgment because the ruler of this world has been condemned,1
537,MAT,17,NRSV,when they came to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him and said lord have mercy on my son for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly he often falls into the fire and often into the water,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him,1
538,MAT,17,NRSV,and i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him,i write to you fathers because you know him who is from the beginning,1
539,MAT,17,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you,be sure of this that no fornicator or impure person or one who is greedy that is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god,1
540,MAT,17,NRSV,how much longer must i put up with you,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each,1
541,MAT,17,NRSV,and jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was cured instantly,so jesus took him and healed him and sent him away,1
542,MAT,17,NRSV,then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why could we not cast it out,then paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself i consider myself fortunate that it is before you king agrippa i am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the jews because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the jews therefore i beg of you to listen to me patiently,1
543,MAT,17,NRSV,he said to them because of your little faith,when jesus said to them i am he they stepped back and fell to the ground,1
544,MAT,17,NRSV,for truly i tell you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you,so from that day on they planned to put him to death,1
545,MAT,17,NRSV,as they were gathering in galilee jesus said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised,greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them,1
546,MAT,17,NRSV,when they reached capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to peter and said does your teacher not pay the temple tax,because they knew it was the lord,1
547,MAT,17,NRSV,and when he came home jesus spoke of it first asking what do you think simon,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart,1
548,MAT,17,NRSV,from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute,listen i am standing at the door knocking if you hear my voice and open the door i will come in to you and eat with you and you with me,1
549,MAT,17,NRSV,from their children or from others,the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice,1
550,MAT,17,NRSV,when peter said from others jesus said to him then the children are free,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him,1
551,MAT,17,NRSV,however so that we do not give offense to them go to the sea and cast a hook take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a coin take that and give it to them for you and me,he said to her let the children be fed first for it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs,1
552,MAT,18,NRSV,at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,but the one to whom little is forgiven loves little,1
553,MAT,18,NRSV,he called a child whom he put among them and said truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler and saul,1
554,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,1
555,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,1
556,MAT,18,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea,blessed are you who are hungry now for you will be filled,1
557,MAT,18,NRSV,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded,1
558,MAT,18,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,1
559,MAT,18,NRSV,take care that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you in heaven their angels continually see the face of my father in heaven,they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people,1
560,MAT,18,NRSV,if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,1
561,MAT,18,NRSV,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise,1
562,MAT,18,NRSV,so it is not the will of your father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost,she said this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people,1
563,MAT,18,NRSV,if another member of the church sins against you go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone,what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me,1
564,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member listens to you you have regained that one,simon answered i suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt,1
565,MAT,18,NRSV,but if you are not listened to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses,then he sent another and that one they killed,1
566,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church let such a one be to you as a gentile and a tax collector,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves,1
567,MAT,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived,1
568,MAT,18,NRSV,again truly i tell you if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven,we declare to you what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life this life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it and declare to you the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ,1
569,MAT,18,NRSV,for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me,1
570,MAT,18,NRSV,then peter came and said to him lord if another member of the church sins against me how often should i forgive,then they secretly instigated some men to say we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god,1
571,MAT,18,NRSV,jesus said to him not seven times but i tell you seventyseven times,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things,1
572,MAT,18,NRSV,for this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves,for i have come to call not the righteous but sinners,1
573,MAT,18,NRSV,when he began the reckoning one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him and as he could not pay his lord ordered him to be sold together with his wife and children and all his possessions and payment to be made,it read jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,1
574,MAT,18,NRSV,so the slave fell on his knees before him saying have patience with me and i will pay you everything,his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,1
575,MAT,18,NRSV,and out of pity for him the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt,no one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light,1
576,MAT,18,NRSV,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,for it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth,1
577,MAT,18,NRSV,then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him have patience with me and i will pay you,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it,1
578,MAT,18,NRSV,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt,his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth,1
579,MAT,18,NRSV,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,so give recognition to such persons,1
580,MAT,18,NRSV,then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me,we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete,1
581,MAT,18,NRSV,should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave as i had mercy on you,and the whole city was gathered around the door,1
582,MAT,18,NRSV,and in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,1
583,MAT,18,NRSV,so my heavenly father will also do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,1
584,MAT,19,NRSV,when jesus had finished saying these things he left galilee and went to the region of judea beyond the jordan,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather,1
585,MAT,19,NRSV,large crowds followed him and he cured them there,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god,1
586,MAT,19,NRSV,some pharisees came to him and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause,and he got up and followed him,1
587,MAT,19,NRSV,he answered have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh,we have heard it ourselves from his own lips,1
588,MAT,19,NRSV,so they are no longer two but one flesh,above all clothe yourselves with love which binds everything together in perfect harmony,1
589,MAT,19,NRSV,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate,when they had found out they said five and two fish,1
590,MAT,19,NRSV,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming,1
591,MAT,19,NRSV,he said to them it was because you were so hardhearted that moses allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so,i permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man she is to keep silent,1
592,MAT,19,NRSV,and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for unchastity and marries another commits adultery,for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of god,1
593,MAT,19,NRSV,his disciples said to him if such is the case of a man with his wife it is better not to marry,so with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people,1
594,MAT,19,NRSV,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given,if you do these things show yourself to the world,1
595,MAT,19,NRSV,for there are eunuchs who have been so from birth and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,anyone who does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him,1
596,MAT,19,NRSV,let anyone accept this who can,but if you do what is wrong you should be afraid for the authority does not bear the sword in vain it is the servant of god to execute wrath on the wrongdoer,1
597,MAT,19,NRSV,then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray,and we bring you the good news that what god promised to our ancestors he has fulfilled for us their children by raising jesus as also it is written in the second psalm you are my son today i have begotten you,1
598,MAT,19,NRSV,the disciples spoke sternly to those who brought them but jesus said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs,and without faith it is impossible to please god for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him,1
599,MAT,19,NRSV,and he laid his hands on them and went on his way,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly,1
600,MAT,19,NRSV,then someone came to him and said teacher what good deed must i do to have eternal life,now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there,1
601,MAT,19,NRSV,and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good,little children let no one deceive you,1
602,MAT,19,NRSV,there is only one who is good,but let us go to him,1
603,MAT,19,NRSV,if you wish to enter into life keep the commandments,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb,1
604,MAT,19,NRSV,he said to him which ones,besides that they learn to be idle gadding about from house to house and they are not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say,1
605,MAT,19,NRSV,and jesus said you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother also you shall love your neighbor as yourself,then he answered them do you want me to release for you the king of the jews,1
606,MAT,19,NRSV,the young man said to him i have kept all these what do i still lack,he dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die,1
607,MAT,19,NRSV,jesus said to him if you wish to be perfect go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me,for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god,1
608,MAT,19,NRSV,when the young man heard this word he went away grieving for he had many possessions,this was during the festival of unleavened bread when he had seized him he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him intending to bring him out to the people after the passover,1
609,MAT,19,NRSV,then jesus said to his disciples truly i tell you it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me,1
610,MAT,19,NRSV,again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money,1
611,MAT,19,NRSV,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved,when they came to jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they reported all that god had done with them,1
612,MAT,19,NRSV,but jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but for god all things are possible,pilate therefore said to him do you refuse to speak to me,1
613,MAT,19,NRSV,then peter said in reply look we have left everything and followed you,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him,1
614,MAT,19,NRSV,jesus said to them truly i tell you at the renewal of all things when the son of man is seated on the throne of his glory you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit,1
615,MAT,19,NRSV,and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my names sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life,immediately they left their nets and followed him,1
616,MAT,19,NRSV,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants,1
617,MAT,20,NRSV,for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard,jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has saved you,1
618,MAT,20,NRSV,after agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard,we must work the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one can work,1
619,MAT,20,NRSV,when he went out about nine oclock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and he said to them you also go into the vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,1
620,MAT,20,NRSV,when he went out again about noon and about three oclock he did the same,i am the living bread that came down from heaven,1
621,MAT,20,NRSV,and about five oclock he went out and found others standing around and he said to them why are you standing here idle all day,do not be deceived bad company ruins good morals,1
622,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him because no one has hired us,jesus answered them do not complain among yourselves,1
623,MAT,20,NRSV,he said to them you also go into the vineyard,to you then who believe he is precious but for those who do not believe the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner and a stone that makes them stumble and a rock that makes them fall,1
624,MAT,20,NRSV,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first,for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins,1
625,MAT,20,NRSV,when those hired about five oclock came each of them received the usual daily wage,they will say to you look there or look here do not go do not set off in pursuit,1
626,MAT,20,NRSV,now when the first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received the usual daily wage,if those to whom the word of god came were called godsand the scripture cannot be annulled can you say that the one whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because i said i am gods son,1
627,MAT,20,NRSV,and when they received it they grumbled against the landowner saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat,go he said and show yourself to the priest and as moses commanded make an offering for your cleansing for a testimony to them,1
628,MAT,20,NRSV,but he replied to one of them friend i am doing you no wrong did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage,but if all prophesy an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all,1
629,MAT,20,NRSV,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god,1
630,MAT,20,NRSV,am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me,he proclaimed the one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals,1
631,MAT,20,NRSV,or are you envious because i am generous,this was to fulfill the word that he had spoken i did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me,1
632,MAT,20,NRSV,so the last will be first and the first will be last,if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other,1
633,MAT,20,NRSV,while jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them on the way see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified and on the third day he will be raised,now the time came for elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son,1
634,MAT,20,NRSV,then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to him with her sons and kneeling before him she asked a favor of him,he answered no then they said to him who are you,1
635,MAT,20,NRSV,and he said to her what do you want,then jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart,1
636,MAT,20,NRSV,she said to him declare that these two sons of mine will sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom,then the jews said is he going to kill himself,1
637,MAT,20,NRSV,but jesus answered you do not know what you are asking,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin,1
638,MAT,20,NRSV,are you able to drink the cup that i am about to drink,as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet,1
639,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him we are able,for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with him in the city and they supposed that paul had brought him into the temple,1
640,MAT,20,NRSV,he said to them you will indeed drink my cup but to sit at my right hand and at my left this is not mine to grant but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my father,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations,1
641,MAT,20,NRSV,when the ten heard it they were angry with the two brothers,and what more should i say,1
642,MAT,20,NRSV,but jesus called them to him and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the lords favor,1
643,MAT,20,NRSV,it will not be so among you but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave just as the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many,through this he received approval as righteous god himself giving approval to his gifts he died but through his faith he still speaks,1
644,MAT,20,NRSV,as they were leaving jericho a large crowd followed him,anyone who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses,1
645,MAT,20,NRSV,there were two blind men sitting by the roadside,see what large letters i make when i am writing in my own hand it is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcisedonly that they may not be persecuted for the cross of christ,1
646,MAT,20,NRSV,when they heard that jesus was passing by they shouted lord have mercy on us son of david the crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet but they shouted even more loudly have mercy on us lord son of david jesus stood still and called them saying what do you want me to do for you,no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven the son of man,1
647,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him lord let our eyes be opened,he said this to test him for he himself knew what he was going to do,1
648,MAT,20,NRSV,moved with compassion jesus touched their eyes,now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid,1
649,MAT,20,NRSV,immediately they regained their sight and followed him,but he did not answer her at all,1
650,MAT,21,NRSV,when they had come near jerusalem and had reached bethphage at the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples saying to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me,a certain woman named lydia a worshiper of god was listening to us she was from the city of thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth,1
651,MAT,21,NRSV,if anyone says anything to you just say this the lord needs them,jesus said make the people sit down,1
652,MAT,21,NRSV,and he will send them immediately,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,1
653,MAT,21,NRSV,this took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion look your king is coming to you humble and mounted on a donkey and on a colt the foal of a donkey,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power,1
654,MAT,21,NRSV,the disciples went and did as jesus had directed them they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and he sat on them,then he began to speak and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,1
655,MAT,21,NRSV,a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road,to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,1
656,MAT,21,NRSV,the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in turmoil asking who is this,some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question saying teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no child the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
657,MAT,21,NRSV,the crowds were saying this is the prophet jesus from nazareth in galilee,greet andronicus and junia my relatives who were in prison with me they are prominent among the apostles and they were in christ before i was,1
658,MAT,21,NRSV,then jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body,1
659,MAT,21,NRSV,he said to them it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of robbers,moreover we had human parents to discipline us and we respected them,1
660,MAT,21,NRSV,the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he cured them,and they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts,1
661,MAT,21,NRSV,but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did and heard the children crying out in the temple hosanna to the son of david they became angry and said to him do you hear what these are saying,she said this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people,1
662,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them yes have you never read out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself,that same day herod and pilate became friends with each other before this they had been enemies,1
663,MAT,21,NRSV,he left them went out of the city to bethany and spent the night there,but barnabas took him brought him to the apostles and described for them how on the road he had seen the lord who had spoken to him and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of jesus,1
664,MAT,21,NRSV,in the morning when he returned to the city he was hungry,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor,1
665,MAT,21,NRSV,and seeing a fig tree by the side of the road he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves,but now that you say we see your sin remains,1
666,MAT,21,NRSV,then he said to it may no fruit ever come from you again and the fig tree withered at once,my little children for whom i am again in the pain of childbirth until christ is formed in you i wish i were present with you now and could change my tone for i am perplexed about you,1
667,MAT,21,NRSV,when the disciples saw it they were amazed saying how did the fig tree wither at once,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,1
668,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus answered them truly i tell you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will be done,at that time the festival of the dedication took place in jerusalem,1
669,MAT,21,NRSV,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive,for this reason i sent you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church,1
670,MAT,21,NRSV,when he entered the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said by what authority are you doing these things and who gave you this authority,the farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains,1
671,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them i will also ask you one question if you tell me the answer then i will also tell you by what authority i do these things,why do you submit to regulations do not handle do not taste do not touch,1
672,MAT,21,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem,1
673,MAT,21,NRSV,and they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not believe him,therefore i declare to you this day that i am not responsible for the blood of any of you for i did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of god,1
674,MAT,21,NRSV,but if we say of human origin we are afraid of the crowd for all regard john as a prophet,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,1
675,MAT,21,NRSV,so they answered jesus we do not know,after they finished speaking james replied my brothers listen to me,1
676,MAT,21,NRSV,and he said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision,1
677,MAT,21,NRSV,a man had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work in the vineyard today,then mary said here am i the servant of the lord let it be with me according to your word,1
678,MAT,21,NRSV,he answered i will not but later he changed his mind and went,then he set sail from ephesus,1
679,MAT,21,NRSV,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me,1
680,MAT,21,NRSV,which of the two did the will of his father,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever,1
681,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them truly i tell you the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of god ahead of you,he said all this quite openly,1
682,MAT,21,NRSV,for john came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him and even after you saw it you did not change your minds and believe him,but if it produces thorns and thistles it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed its end is to be burned over,1
683,MAT,21,NRSV,there was a landowner who planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a wine press in it and built a watchtower,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,1
684,MAT,21,NRSV,then he leased it to tenants and went to another country,i solemnly command you by the lord that this letter be read to all of them,1
685,MAT,21,NRSV,when the harvest time had come he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs,1
686,MAT,21,NRSV,but the tenants seized his slaves and beat one killed another and stoned another,all went to their own towns to be registered,1
687,MAT,21,NRSV,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,at this paul said to him god will strike you you whitewashed wall are you sitting there to judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck,1
688,MAT,21,NRSV,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son,the angel said to her the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be holy he will be called son of god,1
689,MAT,21,NRSV,but when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and get his inheritance,they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people,1
690,MAT,21,NRSV,so they seized him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,he brought simon to jesus who looked at him and said you are simon son of john,1
691,MAT,21,NRSV,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it,1
692,MAT,21,NRSV,they said to him he will put those wretches to a miserable death and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time,and to the angel of the church in laodicea write the words of the amen the faithful and true witness the origin of gods creation i know your works you are neither cold nor hot,1
693,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them have you never read in the scriptures the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the lords doing and it is amazing in our eyes,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish,1
694,MAT,21,NRSV,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,but he passed through the midst of them and went on his way,1
695,MAT,21,NRSV,the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces and it will crush anyone on whom it falls,and a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him,1
696,MAT,21,NRSV,when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they realized that he was speaking about them,but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days,1
697,MAT,21,NRSV,they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet,and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me,1
698,MAT,22,NRSV,once more jesus spoke to them in parables saying the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son,i know my own and my own know me just as the father knows me and i know the father,1
699,MAT,22,NRSV,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come,do not neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders,1
700,MAT,22,NRSV,again he sent other slaves saying tell those who have been invited look i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building,1
701,MAT,22,NRSV,but they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his business while the rest seized his slaves mistreated them and killed them,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,1
702,MAT,22,NRSV,he sent his troops destroyed those murderers and burned their city,for three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth,1
703,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to his slaves the wedding is ready but those invited were not worthy,you sent messengers to john and he testified to the truth,1
704,MAT,22,NRSV,go therefore into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet,on peters arrival cornelius met him and falling at his feet worshiped him,1
705,MAT,22,NRSV,those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found both good and bad so the wedding hall was filled with guests,he entered his headquarters again and asked jesus where are you from,1
706,MAT,22,NRSV,but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding robe,he who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things the gifts he gave were that some would be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of christ until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to maturity to the measure of the full stature of christ,1
707,MAT,22,NRSV,then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,but it is not so among you but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all,1
708,MAT,22,NRSV,for many are called but few are chosen,you will know them by their fruits,1
709,MAT,22,NRSV,then the pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,1
710,MAT,22,NRSV,so they sent their disciples to him along with the herodians saying teacher we know that you are sincere and teach the way of god in accordance with truth and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1
711,MAT,22,NRSV,tell us then what you think,for our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers of this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places,1
712,MAT,22,NRSV,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not,he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god,1
713,MAT,22,NRSV,but jesus aware of their malice said why are you putting me to the test you hypocrites,but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her,1
714,MAT,22,NRSV,show me the coin used for the tax,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,1
715,MAT,22,NRSV,and they brought him a denarius,but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go,1
716,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title,for this is the message you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another,1
717,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to them give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods,now this i affirm and insist on in the lord you must no longer live as the gentiles live in the futility of their minds,1
718,MAT,22,NRSV,when they heard this they were amazed and they left him and went away,then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them,1
719,MAT,22,NRSV,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god,1
720,MAT,22,NRSV,now there were seven brothers among us the first married and died childless leaving the widow to his brother,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing,1
721,MAT,22,NRSV,the second did the same so also the third down to the seventh,after some days paul said to barnabas come let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the lord and see how they are doing,1
722,MAT,22,NRSV,last of all the woman herself died,as for what fell among the thorns these are the ones who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and their fruit does not mature,1
723,MAT,22,NRSV,in the resurrection then whose wife of the seven will she be,they were astounded beyond measure saying he has done everything well he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak,1
724,MAT,22,NRSV,for all of them had married her,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,1
725,MAT,22,NRSV,jesus answered them you are wrong because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god,for a man ought not to have his head veiled since he is the image and reflection of god but woman is the reflection of man,1
726,MAT,22,NRSV,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven,very truly i tell you we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen yet you do not receive our testimony,1
727,MAT,22,NRSV,and as for the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was said to you by god i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,he destined us for adoption as his children through jesus christ according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the beloved,1
728,MAT,22,NRSV,he is god not of the dead but of the living,so it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness,1
729,MAT,22,NRSV,and when the crowd heard it they were astounded at his teaching,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,1
730,MAT,22,NRSV,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness,1
731,MAT,22,NRSV,teacher which commandment in the law is the greatest,i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor,1
732,MAT,22,NRSV,he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom,1
733,MAT,22,NRSV,this is the greatest and first commandment,and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full,1
734,MAT,22,NRSV,and a second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,1
735,MAT,22,NRSV,on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me,1
736,MAT,22,NRSV,now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them this question what do you think of the messiah,and i appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last so that the father will give you whatever you ask him in my name,1
737,MAT,22,NRSV,they said to him the son of david,so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god,1
738,MAT,22,NRSV,he said to them how is it then that david by the spirit calls him lord saying the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet ,when the crowds found out about it they followed him and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and healed those who needed to be cured,1
739,MAT,22,NRSV,if david thus calls him lord how can he be his son,we do not boast beyond limits that is in the labors of others but our hope is that as your faith increases our sphere of action among you may be greatly enlarged so that we may proclaim the good news in lands beyond you without boasting of work already done in someone elses sphere of action,1
740,MAT,22,NRSV,no one was able to give him an answer nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions,as the father has sent me so i send you,1
741,MAT,23,NRSV,then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach,he also said the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how,1
742,MAT,23,NRSV,they tie up heavy burdens hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of others but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them,he went down to capernaum a city in galilee and was teaching them on the sabbath,1
743,MAT,23,NRSV,they do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david to the deportation to babylon fourteen generations and from the deportation to babylon to the messiah fourteen generations,1
744,MAT,23,NRSV,they love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi,the next day we left and came to caesarea and we went into the house of philip the evangelist one of the seven and stayed with him,1
745,MAT,23,NRSV,but you are not to be called rabbi for you have one teacher and you are all students,if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray,1
746,MAT,23,NRSV,and call no one your father on earth for you have one fatherthe one in heaven,we must not put christ to the test as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,1
747,MAT,23,NRSV,nor are you to be called instructors for you have one instructor the messiah,so summoning his masters debtors one by one he asked the first how much do you owe my master,1
748,MAT,23,NRSV,the greatest among you will be your servant,i am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh i am completing what is lacking in christs afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church,1
749,MAT,23,NRSV,all who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves will be exalted,this was to fulfill the word that he had spoken i did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me,1
750,MAT,23,NRSV,but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven,see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven,1
751,MAT,23,NRSV,for you do not go in yourselves and when others are going in you stop them,but for that very reason i received mercy so that in me as the foremost jesus christ might display the utmost patience making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life,1
752,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you cross sea and land to make a single convert and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves,now hagar is mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children,1
753,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you blind guides who say whoever swears by the sanctuary is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath,but paul replied they have beaten us in public uncondemned men who are roman citizens and have thrown us into prison and now are they going to discharge us in secret,1
754,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind fools for which is greater the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred,then they led him away to crucify him,1
755,MAT,23,NRSV,and you say whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath,i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you,1
756,MAT,23,NRSV,how blind you are for which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred,then some of the scribes said to themselves this man is blaspheming,1
757,MAT,23,NRSV,so whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it and whoever swears by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who dwells in it and whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of god and by the one who is seated upon it,was i vacillating when i wanted to do this,1
758,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith,then they led him away to crucify him,1
759,MAT,23,NRSV,it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,1
760,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind guides you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence,he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy,1
761,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup so that the outside also may become clean,so they asked him teacher we know that you are right in what you say and teach and you show deference to no one but teach the way of god in accordance with truth,1
762,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside look beautiful but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth,he will show you a large room upstairs already furnished,1
763,MAT,23,NRSV,so you also on the outside look righteous to others but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness,the crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by philip hearing and seeing the signs that he did for unclean spirits crying with loud shrieks came out of many who were possessed and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured,1
764,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think,1
765,MAT,23,NRSV,thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets,are you not my work in the lord,1
766,MAT,23,NRSV,fill up then the measure of your ancestors,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,1
767,MAT,23,NRSV,you snakes you brood of vipers how can you escape being sentenced to hell,this jesus is the stone that was rejected by you the builders it has become the cornerstone,1
768,MAT,23,NRSV,therefore i send you prophets sages and scribes some of whom you will kill and crucify and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah son of barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor,1
769,MAT,23,NRSV,truly i tell you all this will come upon this generation,they love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi,1
770,MAT,23,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing see your house is left to you desolate,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation,1
771,MAT,23,NRSV,for i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for this bountiful gift that you have promised so that it may be ready as a voluntary gift and not as an extortion,1
772,MAT,24,NRSV,as jesus came out of the temple and was going away his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about,1
773,MAT,24,NRSV,then he asked them you see all these do you not,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him,1
774,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out,1
775,MAT,24,NRSV,when he was sitting on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when will this be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age,do you not know brothers and sisters for i am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only during that persons lifetime,1
776,MAT,24,NRSV,jesus answered them beware that no one leads you astray,if in my name you ask me for anything i will do it,1
777,MAT,24,NRSV,for many will come in my name saying i am the messiah and they will lead many astray,he answered a hundred jugs of olive oil,1
778,MAT,24,NRSV,and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not alarmed for this must take place but the end is not yet,therefore i send you prophets sages and scribes some of whom you will kill and crucify and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah son of barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar,1
779,MAT,24,NRSV,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs,his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,1
780,MAT,24,NRSV,then they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name,beloved do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good,1
781,MAT,24,NRSV,then many will fall away and they will betray one another and hate one another,so he got into the boat and returned,1
782,MAT,24,NRSV,and many false prophets will arise and lead many astray,when herod had searched for him and could not find him he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death,1
783,MAT,24,NRSV,and because of the increase of lawlessness the love of many will grow cold,because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous,1
784,MAT,24,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved,never do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her,1
785,MAT,24,NRSV,and this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come, so the pharisees and the scribes asked him why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders but eat with defiled hands,1
786,MAT,24,NRSV,so when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place as was spoken of by the prophet daniel let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread,1
787,MAT,24,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath,the lord be with all of you,1
788,MAT,24,NRSV,for at that time there will be great suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no and never will be,immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed and he began to speak praising god,1
789,MAT,24,NRSV,and if those days had not been cut short no one would be saved but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short,but now you must get rid of all such thingsanger wrath malice slander and abusive language from your mouth,1
790,MAT,24,NRSV,then if anyone says to you look here is the messiah or there he isdo not believe it,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb,1
791,MAT,24,NRSV,for false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens to lead astray if possible even the elect,let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed the one destined for destruction,1
792,MAT,24,NRSV,take note i have told you beforehand,but get up and stand on your feet for i have appeared to you for this purpose to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which i will appear to you,1
793,MAT,24,NRSV,so if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out,others said he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities,1
794,MAT,24,NRSV,if they say look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it,for we are the temple of the living god as god said i will live in them and walk among them and i will be their god and they shall be my people,1
795,MAT,24,NRSV,for as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west so will be the coming of the son of man,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1
796,MAT,24,NRSV,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather,now a bishop must be above reproach married only once temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money,1
797,MAT,24,NRSV,immediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of heaven will be shaken,then he withdrew from them about a stones throw knelt down and prayed father if you are willing remove this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done,1
798,MAT,24,NRSV,then the sign of the son of man will appear in heaven and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory,will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,1
799,MAT,24,NRSV,and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other,as he went the crowds pressed in on him,1
800,MAT,24,NRSV,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near,by this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit,1
801,MAT,24,NRSV,so also when you see all these things you know that he is near at the very gates,day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me,1
802,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place,and immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and his sight was restored,1
803,MAT,24,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,1
804,MAT,24,NRSV,but about that day and hour no one knows neither the angels of heaven nor the son but only the father,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail,1
805,MAT,24,NRSV,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man,and when they could not bring him to jesus because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and after having dug through it they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay,1
806,MAT,24,NRSV,for as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away so too will be the coming of the son of man,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,1
807,MAT,24,NRSV,then two will be in the field one will be taken and one will be left,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,1
808,MAT,24,NRSV,two women will be grinding meal together one will be taken and one will be left,take note i have told you beforehand,1
809,MAT,24,NRSV,keep awake therefore for you do not know on what day your lord is coming,for the seven had married her,1
810,MAT,24,NRSV,but understand this if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into,jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband,1
811,MAT,24,NRSV,therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour,then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass,1
812,MAT,24,NRSV,who then is the faithful and wise slave whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god,1
813,MAT,24,NRSV,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail,1
814,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions,my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of god,1
815,MAT,24,NRSV,but if that wicked slave says to himself my master is delayed and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know,you want something and do not have it so you commit murder,1
816,MAT,24,NRSV,he will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,then people came to see what it was that had happened,1
817,MAT,25,NRSV,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,one day peter and john were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer at three oclock in the afternoon,1
818,MAT,25,NRSV,ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom,he answered them i have told you already and you would not listen,1
819,MAT,25,NRSV,five of them were foolish and five were wise,and the one with the two talents also came forward saying master you handed over to me two talents see i have made two more talents,1
820,MAT,25,NRSV,when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps,or do you show contempt for the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing,1
821,MAT,25,NRSV,as the bridegroom was delayed all of them became drowsy and slept,thomas said to him lord we do not know where you are going,1
822,MAT,25,NRSV,but at midnight there was a shout look here is the bridegroom come out to meet him,when the swineherds saw what had happened they ran off and told it in the city and in the country,1
823,MAT,25,NRSV,then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps,some of the crowd gave instructions to alexander whom the jews had pushed forward,1
824,MAT,25,NRSV,the foolish said to the wise give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out,when the young men came in they found her dead so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband,1
825,MAT,25,NRSV,but the wise replied no there will not be enough for you and for us you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves,but he turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,1
826,MAT,25,NRSV,and while they went to buy it the bridegroom came and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet and the door was shut,this i say by way of concession not of command,1
827,MAT,25,NRSV,later the other bridesmaids came also saying lord lord open to us,let us have an answer for those who sent us,1
828,MAT,25,NRSV,but he replied truly i tell you i do not know you,for we are in danger of being charged with rioting today since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion,1
829,MAT,25,NRSV,keep awake therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour,where is the one who is wise,1
830,MAT,25,NRSV,for it is as if a man going on a journey summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them to one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his ability,my brothers and sisters if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinners soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins,1
831,MAT,25,NRSV,the one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them and made five more talents,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money,1
832,MAT,25,NRSV,in the same way the one who had the two talents made two more talents,so then friends we are children not of the slave but of the free woman,1
833,MAT,25,NRSV,but the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money,the end of those things is death,1
834,MAT,25,NRSV,after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat,1
835,MAT,25,NRSV,then the one who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more talents saying master you handed over to me five talents see i have made five more talents,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price,1
836,MAT,25,NRSV,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,1
837,MAT,25,NRSV,and the one with the two talents also came forward saying master you handed over to me two talents see i have made two more talents,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him,1
838,MAT,25,NRSV,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,1
839,MAT,25,NRSV,then the one who had received the one talent also came forward saying master i knew that you were a harsh man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed so i was afraid and i went and hid your talent in the ground,so also when you see all these things you know that he is near at the very gates,1
840,MAT,25,NRSV,here you have what is yours,when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they presented paul also before him,1
841,MAT,25,NRSV,but his master replied you wicked and lazy slave you knew did you that i reap where i did not sow and gather where i did not scatter,they said to one another it is because we have no bread,1
842,MAT,25,NRSV,then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and on my return i would have received what was my own with interest,god knows i do and what i do i will also continue to do in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about,1
843,MAT,25,NRSV,so take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents,when they heard this they were amazed and they left him and went away,1
844,MAT,25,NRSV,for to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,i repeat let no one think that i am a fool but if you do then accept me as a fool so that i too may boast a little,1
845,MAT,25,NRSV,as for this worthless slave throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,well then does god supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard,1
846,MAT,25,NRSV,when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me,1
847,MAT,25,NRSV,all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left,in the same way the one who had the two talents made two more talents,1
848,MAT,25,NRSV,then the king will say to those at his right hand come you that are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you welcomed me i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you took care of me i was in prison and you visited me,when the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to jerusalem,1
849,MAT,25,NRSV,then the righteous will answer him lord when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food or thirsty and gave you something to drink,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children,1
850,MAT,25,NRSV,and when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you or naked and gave you clothing,and all the residents of lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord,1
851,MAT,25,NRSV,and when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan,1
852,MAT,25,NRSV,and the king will answer them truly i tell you just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family you did it to me,bring me a denarius and let me see it,1
853,MAT,25,NRSV,then he will say to those at his left hand you that are accursed depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink i was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not give me clothing sick and in prison and you did not visit me,then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,1
854,MAT,25,NRSV,then they also will answer lord when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not take care of you,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father,1
855,MAT,25,NRSV,then he will answer them truly i tell you just as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me,therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away and tell the people he has been raised from the dead and the last deception would be worse than the first,1
856,MAT,25,NRSV,and these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life,but when the disciples surrounded him he got up and went into the city,1
857,MAT,26,NRSV,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk,1
858,MAT,26,NRSV,then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas and they conspired to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him,when the pharisees saw it they said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath,1
859,MAT,26,NRSV,but they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people,so faith by itself if it has no works is dead,1
860,MAT,26,NRSV,now while jesus was at bethany in the house of simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table,i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income,1
861,MAT,26,NRSV,but when the disciples saw it they were angry and said why this waste,and he replied who are my mother and my brothers,1
862,MAT,26,NRSV,for this ointment could have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor,he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts,1
863,MAT,26,NRSV,but jesus aware of this said to them why do you trouble the woman,indeed the king knows about these things and to him i speak freely for i am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice for this was not done in a corner,1
864,MAT,26,NRSV,she has performed a good service for me,all who cleanse themselves of the things i have mentioned will become special utensils dedicated and useful to the owner of the house ready for every good work,1
865,MAT,26,NRSV,for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me,now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles,1
866,MAT,26,NRSV,by pouring this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial,his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth,1
867,MAT,26,NRSV,truly i tell you wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1
868,MAT,26,NRSV,then one of the twelve who was called judas iscariot went to the chief priests and said what will you give me if i betray him to you,now it was a sabbath day when jesus made the mud and opened his eyes,1
869,MAT,26,NRSV,they paid him thirty pieces of silver,the scripture says no one who believes in him will be put to shame,1
870,MAT,26,NRSV,and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,yet all these though they were commended for their faith did not receive what was promised since god had provided something better so that they would not apart from us be made perfect,1
871,MAT,26,NRSV,on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the passover,therefore my brothers and sisters whom i love and long for my joy and crown stand firm in the lord in this way my beloved,1
872,MAT,26,NRSV,he said go into the city to a certain man and say to him the teacher says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples,and if a house is divided against itself that house will not be able to stand,1
873,MAT,26,NRSV,so the disciples did as jesus had directed them and they prepared the passover meal,these are what defile a person but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile,1
874,MAT,26,NRSV,when it was evening he took his place with the twelve and while they were eating he said truly i tell you one of you will betray me,i have heard of your faith in the lord jesus and your love toward all the saints and for this reason i do not cease to give thanks for you as i remember you in my prayers,1
875,MAT,26,NRSV,and they became greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another surely not i lord,put to death therefore whatever in you is earthly fornication impurity passion evil desire and greed which is idolatry,1
876,MAT,26,NRSV,he answered the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me,let all things be done for building up,1
877,MAT,26,NRSV,the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born,indeed by faith our ancestors received approval,1
878,MAT,26,NRSV,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi,so faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes through the word of christ,1
879,MAT,26,NRSV,he replied you have said so,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for,1
880,MAT,26,NRSV,while they were eating jesus took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you,1
881,MAT,26,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision,1
882,MAT,26,NRSV,i tell you i will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,when he had seen the vision we immediately tried to cross over to macedonia being convinced that god had called us to proclaim the good news to them,1
883,MAT,26,NRSV,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good,1
884,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus said to them you will all become deserters because of me this night for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered,indeed we felt that we had received the sentence of death so that we would rely not on ourselves but on god who raises the dead,1
885,MAT,26,NRSV,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee,two women will be grinding meal together one will be taken and one will be left,1
886,MAT,26,NRSV,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,he came down with them and stood on a level place with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all judea jerusalem and the coast of tyre and sidon,1
887,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him truly i tell you this very night before the cock crows you will deny me three times,it is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times and not only when i am present with you,1
888,MAT,26,NRSV,peter said to him even though i must die with you i will not deny you,and you do many things like this,1
889,MAT,26,NRSV,and so said all the disciples,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this,1
890,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus went with them to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i go over there and pray,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer,1
891,MAT,26,NRSV,he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be grieved and agitated,after eight days had passed it was time to circumcise the child and he was called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb,1
892,MAT,26,NRSV,then he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and stay awake with me,after this when jesus knew that all was now finished he said in order to fulfill the scripture i am thirsty,1
893,MAT,26,NRSV,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed my father if it is possible let this cup pass from me yet not what i want but what you want,drive out the wicked person from among you,1
894,MAT,26,NRSV,then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping and he said to peter so could you not stay awake with me one hour,so it depends not on human will or exertion but on god who shows mercy,1
895,MAT,26,NRSV,stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1
896,MAT,26,NRSV,again he went away for the second time and prayed my father if this cannot pass unless i drink it your will be done,then he got up and was baptized and after taking some food he regained his strength,1
897,MAT,26,NRSV,again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy,when it was evening there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who was also a disciple of jesus,1
898,MAT,26,NRSV,so leaving them again he went away and prayed for the third time saying the same words,greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them,1
899,MAT,26,NRSV,then he came to the disciples and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest,all these evil things come from within and they defile a person,1
900,MAT,26,NRSV,see the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me,1
901,MAT,26,NRSV,get up let us be going,when silas and timothy arrived from macedonia paul was occupied with proclaiming the word testifying to the jews that the messiah was jesus,1
902,MAT,26,NRSV,see my betrayer is at hand,agrippa said to paul are you so quickly persuading me to become a christian,1
903,MAT,26,NRSV,while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the elders of the people,for the whole law is summed up in a single commandment you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1
904,MAT,26,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him,so whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it and whoever swears by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who dwells in it and whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of god and by the one who is seated upon it,1
905,MAT,26,NRSV,at once he came up to jesus and said greetings rabbi and kissed him,it so happened that the father of publius lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery,1
906,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him friend do what you are here to do,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you,1
907,MAT,26,NRSV,then they came and laid hands on jesus and arrested him,we know that those who are born of god do not sin but the one who was born of god protects them and the evil one does not touch them,1
908,MAT,26,NRSV,suddenly one of those with jesus put his hand on his sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear,he asked them do you think that because these galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other galileans,1
909,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus said to him put your sword back into its place for all who take the sword will perish by the sword,but if you do not believe what he wrote how will you believe what i say,1
910,MAT,26,NRSV,do you think that i cannot appeal to my father and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels,at that time they made a calf offered a sacrifice to the idol and reveled in the works of their hands,1
911,MAT,26,NRSV,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,1
912,MAT,26,NRSV,at that hour jesus said to the crowds have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though i were a bandit,no but one is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet,1
913,MAT,26,NRSV,day after day i sat in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me,see i am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves,1
914,MAT,26,NRSV,but all this has taken place so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled,so throwing off his cloak he sprang up and came to jesus,1
915,MAT,26,NRSV,then all the disciples deserted him and fled,then i went and washed and received my sight,1
916,MAT,26,NRSV,those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow,1
917,MAT,26,NRSV,but peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and going inside he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end,because he himself was tested by what he suffered he is able to help those who are being tested,1
918,MAT,26,NRSV,now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against jesus so that they might put him to death but they found none though many false witnesses came forward,truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom,1
919,MAT,26,NRSV,at last two came forward and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days,he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts,1
920,MAT,26,NRSV,the high priest stood up and said have you no answer,to you then who believe he is precious but for those who do not believe the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner and a stone that makes them stumble and a rock that makes them fall,1
921,MAT,26,NRSV,what is it that they testify against you,now john was clothed with camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey,1
922,MAT,26,NRSV,then the high priest said to him i put you under oath before the living god tell us if you are the messiah the son of god,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom,1
923,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him you have said so,or what woman having ten silver coins if she loses one of them does not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it,1
924,MAT,26,NRSV,but i tell you from now on you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven,so jesus said to them very truly i tell you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you,1
925,MAT,26,NRSV,then the high priest tore his clothes and said he has blasphemed why do we still need witnesses,and no one after drinking old wine desires new wine but says the old is good,1
926,MAT,26,NRSV,you have now heard his blasphemy,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son,1
927,MAT,26,NRSV,then they spat in his face and struck him and some slapped him saying prophesy to us you messiah who is it that struck you,in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots,1
928,MAT,26,NRSV,now peter was sitting outside in the courtyard,and i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to jesus,1
929,MAT,26,NRSV,a servantgirl came to him and said you also were with jesus the galilean,when he came to the house he did not allow anyone to enter with him except peter john and james and the childs father and mother,1
930,MAT,26,NRSV,but he denied it before all of them saying i do not know what you are talking about,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him,1
931,MAT,26,NRSV,when he went out to the porch another servantgirl saw him and she said to the bystanders this man was with jesus of nazareth,you believe that god is one you do well,1
932,MAT,26,NRSV,again he denied it with an oath i do not know the man,and his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light,1
933,MAT,26,NRSV,after a little while the bystanders came up and said to peter certainly you are also one of them for your accent betrays you,then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first,1
934,MAT,26,NRSV,then he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know the man at that moment the cock crowed,the jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,1
935,MAT,26,NRSV,then peter remembered what jesus had said before the cock crows you will deny me three times,do not let anyone disqualify you insisting on selfabasement and worship of angels dwelling on visions puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking and not holding fast to the head from whom the whole body nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows with a growth that is from god,1
936,MAT,26,NRSV,and he went out and wept bitterly,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man,1
937,MAT,27,NRSV,when morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against jesus in order to bring about his death,it was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon while the suns light failed and the curtain of the temple was torn in two,1
938,MAT,27,NRSV,they bound him led him away and handed him over to pilate the governor,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings,1
939,MAT,27,NRSV,when judas his betrayer saw that jesus was condemned he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,the coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of satan who uses all power signs lying wonders and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved,1
940,MAT,27,NRSV,he said i have sinned by betraying innocent blood,when john heard in prison what the messiah was doing he sent word by his disciples and said to him are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another,1
941,MAT,27,NRSV,but they said what is that to us,he saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down being lowered to the ground by its four corners,1
942,MAT,27,NRSV,throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple he departed and he went and hanged himself,beloved do not grumble against one another so that you may not be judged,1
943,MAT,27,NRSV,but the chief priests taking the pieces of silver said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury since they are blood money,then jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to cure every disease and every sickness,1
944,MAT,27,NRSV,after conferring together they used them to buy the potters field as a place to bury foreigners,let the evildoer still do evil and the filthy still be filthy and the righteous still do right and the holy still be holy,1
945,MAT,27,NRSV,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,what do you not have homes to eat and drink in,1
946,MAT,27,NRSV,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of the one on whom a price had been set on whom some of the people of israel had set a price and they gave them for the potters field as the lord commanded me,they count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime,1
947,MAT,27,NRSV,now jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him are you the king of the jews,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet,1
948,MAT,27,NRSV,but when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he did not answer,in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay some for special use some for ordinary,1
949,MAT,27,NRSV,then pilate said to him do you not hear how many accusations they make against you,the pharisee standing by himself was praying thus god i thank you that i am not like other people thieves rogues adulterers or even like this tax collector,1
950,MAT,27,NRSV,but he gave him no answer not even to a single charge so that the governor was greatly amazed,for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family,1
951,MAT,27,NRSV,now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd anyone whom they wanted,but someone will say you have faith and i have works,1
952,MAT,27,NRSV,at that time they had a notorious prisoner called jesus barabbas,i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now,1
953,MAT,27,NRSV,so after they had gathered pilate said to them whom do you want me to release for you jesus barabbas or jesus who is called the messiah,so he went in to stay with them,1
954,MAT,27,NRSV,for he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over,on reading the letter he asked what province he belonged to and when he learned that he was from cilicia he said i will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive,1
955,MAT,27,NRSV,while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent word to him have nothing to do with that innocent man for today i have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him,and i know that his commandment is eternal life,1
956,MAT,27,NRSV,now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for barabbas and to have jesus killed,they took jesus to the high priest and all the chief priests the elders and the scribes were assembled,1
957,MAT,27,NRSV,the governor again said to them which of the two do you want me to release for you,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,1
958,MAT,27,NRSV,pilate said to them then what should i do with jesus who is called the messiah,and he said bring them here to me,1
959,MAT,27,NRSV,all of them said let him be crucified then he asked why what evil has he done,now the words it was reckoned to him were written not for his sake alone but for ours also,1
960,MAT,27,NRSV,but they shouted all the more let him be crucified so when pilate saw that he could do nothing but rather that a riot was beginning he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd saying i am innocent of this mans blood see to it yourselves,she bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial,1
961,MAT,27,NRSV,then the people as a whole answered his blood be on us and on our children so he released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified,friends i beg you become as i am for i also have become as you are,1
962,MAT,27,NRSV,then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the governors headquarters and they gathered the whole cohort around him,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god,1
963,MAT,27,NRSV,they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on his head,whatever town or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave,1
964,MAT,27,NRSV,they put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head,they have been told about you that you teach all the jews living among the gentiles to forsake moses and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs,1
965,MAT,27,NRSV,after mocking him they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him,or what fellowship is there between light and darkness,1
966,MAT,27,NRSV,then they led him away to crucify him,and all the residents of lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord,1
967,MAT,27,NRSV,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs,1
968,MAT,27,NRSV,and when they came to a place called golgotha which means place of a skull they offered him wine to drink mixed with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it,but the wise replied no there will not be enough for you and for us you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves,1
969,MAT,27,NRSV,and when they had crucified him they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots then they sat down there and kept watch over him,you have laid up treasure for the last days,1
970,MAT,27,NRSV,over his head they put the charge against him which read this is jesus the king of the jews,at the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steeringoars then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach,1
971,MAT,27,NRSV,then two bandits were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left,therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of god for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring,1
972,MAT,27,NRSV,those who passed by derided him shaking their heads and saying you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself if you are the son of god come down from the cross,as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil,1
973,MAT,27,NRSV,in the same way the chief priests also along with the scribes and elders were mocking him saying he saved others he cannot save himself,his parents answered we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but we do not know how it is that now he sees nor do we know who opened his eyes,1
974,MAT,27,NRSV,he is the king of israel let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him,when the devil had finished every test he departed from him until an opportune time,1
975,MAT,27,NRSV,he trusts in god let god deliver him now if he wants to for he said i am gods son,and he said to them suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves of bread for a friend of mine has arrived and i have nothing to set before him,1
976,MAT,27,NRSV,the bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way,while we were staying there for several days a prophet named agabus came down from judea,1
977,MAT,27,NRSV,from noon on darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid,1
978,MAT,27,NRSV,and about three oclock jesus cried with a loud voice eli eli lema sabachthani,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover,1
979,MAT,27,NRSV,that is my god my god why have you forsaken me,when the pharisees saw it they said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath,1
980,MAT,27,NRSV,when some of the bystanders heard it they said this man is calling for elijah,the pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him and the chief priests and pharisees sent temple police to arrest him,1
981,MAT,27,NRSV,at once one of them ran and got a sponge filled it with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink,and now i commend you to god and to the message of his grace a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified,1
982,MAT,27,NRSV,but the others said wait let us see whether elijah will come to save him,they tie up heavy burdens hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of others but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them,1
983,MAT,27,NRSV,then jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,1
984,MAT,27,NRSV,at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
985,MAT,27,NRSV,the earth shook and the rocks were split,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side,1
986,MAT,27,NRSV,the tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,look there is the place they laid him,1
987,MAT,27,NRSV,after his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many,now there was a great deal of grass in the place so they sat down about five thousand in all,1
988,MAT,27,NRSV,now when the centurion and those with him who were keeping watch over jesus saw the earthquake and what took place they were terrified and said truly this man was gods son many women were also there looking on from a distance they had followed jesus from galilee and had provided for him,so because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i am about to spit you out of my mouth,1
989,MAT,27,NRSV,among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joseph and the mother of the sons of zebedee,when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure when slandered we speak kindly,1
990,MAT,27,NRSV,when it was evening there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who was also a disciple of jesus,and you do many things like this,1
991,MAT,27,NRSV,he went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus then pilate ordered it to be given to him,how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt,1
992,MAT,27,NRSV,so joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn in the rock,after spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of galatia and phrygia strengthening all the disciples,1
993,MAT,27,NRSV,he then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away,jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness where for forty days he was tempted by the devil,1
994,MAT,27,NRSV,mary magdalene and the other mary were there sitting opposite the tomb,the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a violent earthquake such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth so violent was that earthquake,1
995,MAT,27,NRSV,the next day that is after the day of preparation the chief priests and the pharisees gathered before pilate and said sir we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive after three days i will rise again,but by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the godless,1
996,MAT,27,NRSV,therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away and tell the people he has been raised from the dead and the last deception would be worse than the first,but jews came there from antioch and iconium and won over the crowds,1
997,MAT,27,NRSV,pilate said to them you have a guard of soldiers go make it as secure as you can,all who heard him were amazed and said is not this the man who made havoc in jerusalem among those who invoked this name,1
998,MAT,27,NRSV,so they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit,1
999,MAT,28,NRSV,after the sabbath as the first day of the week was dawning mary magdalene and the other mary went to see the tomb,but you are not in the flesh you are in the spirit since the spirit of god dwells in you,1
1000,MAT,28,NRSV,and suddenly there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descending from heaven came and rolled back the stone and sat on it,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,1
1001,MAT,28,NRSV,his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow,immediately mist and darkness came over him and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand,1
1002,MAT,28,NRSV,for fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men,one day while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting near by they had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal,1
1003,MAT,28,NRSV,but the angel said to the women do not be afraid i know that you are looking for jesus who was crucified,last of all the woman herself died,1
1004,MAT,28,NRSV,he is not here for he has been raised as he said,see the judge is standing at the doors as an example of suffering and patience beloved take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord,1
1005,MAT,28,NRSV,come see the place where he lay,now a certain man named simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of samaria saying that he was someone great,1
1006,MAT,28,NRSV,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him,was it before or after he had been circumcised,1
1007,MAT,28,NRSV,this is my message for you,then the jews said is he going to kill himself,1
1008,MAT,28,NRSV,so they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples,for why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone elses conscience,1
1009,MAT,28,NRSV,suddenly jesus met them and said greetings and they came to him took hold of his feet and worshiped him,do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas,1
1010,MAT,28,NRSV,then jesus said to them do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to galilee there they will see me,when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure when slandered we speak kindly,1
1011,MAT,28,NRSV,while they were going some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened,but they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke,1
1012,MAT,28,NRSV,after the priests had assembled with the elders they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers telling them you must say his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep,for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work but only until the one who now restrains it is removed,1
1013,MAT,28,NRSV,if this comes to the governors ears we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me,1
1014,MAT,28,NRSV,so they took the money and did as they were directed,for so the lord has commanded us saying i have set you to be a light for the gentiles so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth,1
1015,MAT,28,NRSV,and this story is still told among the jews to this day,for if a woman will not veil herself then she should cut off her hair but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved she should wear a veil,1
1016,MAT,28,NRSV,now the eleven disciples went to galilee to the mountain to which jesus had directed them,he also told them a parable no one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment otherwise the new will be torn and the piece from the new will not match the old,1
1017,MAT,28,NRSV,when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,1
1018,MAT,28,NRSV,and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me,this i say by way of concession not of command,1
1019,MAT,28,NRSV,go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything that i have commanded you,so then putting away falsehood let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors for we are members of one another,1
1020,MAT,28,NRSV,and remember i am with you always to the end of the age,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name,1
1021,MRK,1,NRSV,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ,1
1022,MRK,1,NRSV,as it is written in the prophet isaiah see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight john the baptizer appeared in the wilderness proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,1
1023,MRK,1,NRSV,and people from the whole judean countryside and all the people of jerusalem were going out to him and were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins,as he approached the gate of the town a man who had died was being carried out,1
1024,MRK,1,NRSV,now john was clothed with camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey,let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs,1
1025,MRK,1,NRSV,he proclaimed the one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals,is it not they who drag you into court,1
1026,MRK,1,NRSV,i have baptized you with water but he will baptize you with the holy spirit,the disagreement became so sharp that they parted company barnabas took mark with him and sailed away to cyprus,1
1027,MRK,1,NRSV,in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan,he had still one other a beloved son,1
1028,MRK,1,NRSV,and just as he was coming up out of the water he saw the heavens torn apart and the spirit descending like a dove on him,and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell,1
1029,MRK,1,NRSV,and a voice came from heaven you are my son the beloved with you i am well pleased,so they said to one another let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see who will get it,1
1030,MRK,1,NRSV,and the spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness,from this we know that it is the last hour,1
1031,MRK,1,NRSV,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him,i do not even judge myself,1
1032,MRK,1,NRSV,now after john was arrested jesus came to galilee proclaiming the good news of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe in the good news,can a demon open the eyes of the blind,1
1033,MRK,1,NRSV,as jesus passed along the sea of galilee he saw simon and his brother andrew casting a net into the seafor they were fishermen,we say faith was reckoned to abraham as righteousness,1
1034,MRK,1,NRSV,and jesus said to them follow me and i will make you fish for people,last of all the woman herself died,1
1035,MRK,1,NRSV,and immediately they left their nets and followed him,he replied truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise,1
1036,MRK,1,NRSV,as he went a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john who were in their boat mending the nets,but when the crowd had been put outside he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up,1
1037,MRK,1,NRSV,immediately he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him,now when the apostles at jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them,1
1038,MRK,1,NRSV,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,and paul went in as was his custom and on three sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures explaining and proving that it was necessary for the messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying this is the messiah jesus whom i am proclaiming to you,1
1039,MRK,1,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes,but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did and heard the children crying out in the temple hosanna to the son of david they became angry and said to him do you hear what these are saying,1
1040,MRK,1,NRSV,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,there he became the father of two sons,1
1041,MRK,1,NRSV,have you come to destroy us,they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on his head,1
1042,MRK,1,NRSV,i know who you are the holy one of god,their condemnation pronounced against them long ago has not been idle and their destruction is not asleep,1
1043,MRK,1,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him and the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him,i reprove and discipline those whom i love,1
1044,MRK,1,NRSV,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this,now the passover the festival of the jews was near,1
1045,MRK,1,NRSV,a new teachingwith authority he commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him,pilate asked him so you are a king,1
1046,MRK,1,NRSV,at once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of galilee,then he leased it to tenants and went to another country,1
1047,MRK,1,NRSV,as soon as they left the synagogue they entered the house of simon and andrew with james and john,for i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,1
1048,MRK,1,NRSV,now simons motherinlaw was in bed with a fever and they told him about her at once,god remembered great babylon and gave her the winecup of the fury of his wrath,1
1049,MRK,1,NRSV,he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up,and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon,1
1050,MRK,1,NRSV,then the fever left her and she began to serve them,let your word be yes yes or no no anything more than this comes from the evil one,1
1051,MRK,1,NRSV,that evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons,if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray,1
1052,MRK,1,NRSV,and the whole city was gathered around the door,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,1
1053,MRK,1,NRSV,and he cured many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons and he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him,and the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they dressed him in a purple robe,1
1054,MRK,1,NRSV,in the morning while it was still very dark he got up and went out to a deserted place and there he prayed,now a bishop must be above reproach married only once temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money,1
1055,MRK,1,NRSV,and simon and his companions hunted for him,jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,1
1056,MRK,1,NRSV,when they found him they said to him everyone is searching for you,do you want me to release for you the king of the jews,1
1057,MRK,1,NRSV,he answered let us go on to the neighboring towns so that i may proclaim the message there also for that is what i came out to do,so he said let those of you who have the authority come down with me and if there is anything wrong about the man let them accuse him,1
1058,MRK,1,NRSV,and he went throughout galilee proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else,1
1059,MRK,1,NRSV,a leper came to him begging him and kneeling he said to him if you choose you can make me clean,as he came near and saw the city he wept over it saying if you even you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace but now they are hidden from your eyes,1
1060,MRK,1,NRSV,moved with pity jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him i do choose,do not neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders,1
1061,MRK,1,NRSV,be made clean immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean,on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river where we supposed there was a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there,1
1062,MRK,1,NRSV,after sternly warning him he sent him away at once saying to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what moses commanded as a testimony to them,be hospitable to one another without complaining,1
1063,MRK,1,NRSV,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter,i found that he was accused concerning questions of their law but was charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment,1
1064,MRK,2,NRSV,when he returned to capernaum after some days it was reported that he was at home,when the pharisees saw it they said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath,1
1065,MRK,2,NRSV,so many gathered around that there was no longer room for them not even in front of the door and he was speaking the word to them,so also the son of man is about to suffer at their hands,1
1066,MRK,2,NRSV,then some people came bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four of them,this continued for two years so that all the residents of asia both jews and greeks heard the word of the lord,1
1067,MRK,2,NRSV,and when they could not bring him to jesus because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and after having dug through it they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven,1
1068,MRK,2,NRSV,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven,they said is not this josephs son,1
1069,MRK,2,NRSV,now some of the scribes were sitting there questioning in their hearts why does this fellow speak in this way,and i lay down my life for the sheep,1
1070,MRK,2,NRSV,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,1
1071,MRK,2,NRSV,at once jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves and he said to them why do you raise such questions in your hearts,if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven them if you retain the sins of any they are retained,1
1072,MRK,2,NRSV,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk,live in harmony with one another do not be haughty but associate with the lowly do not claim to be wiser than you are,1
1073,MRK,2,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralytic i say to you stand up take your mat and go to your home,do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar,1
1074,MRK,2,NRSV,and he stood up and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them so that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we have never seen anything like this jesus went out again beside the sea the whole crowd gathered around him and he taught them,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
1075,MRK,2,NRSV,as he was walking along he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about,1
1076,MRK,2,NRSV,and he got up and followed him,then jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham,1
1077,MRK,2,NRSV,and as he sat at dinner in levis house many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting with jesus and his disciplesfor there were many who followed him,so john summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the lord to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another,1
1078,MRK,2,NRSV,when the scribes of the pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors they said to his disciples why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners,when the harvest time had come he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce,1
1079,MRK,2,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to them those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners,when his daughter herodias came in and danced she pleased herod and his guests and the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you wish and i will give it,1
1080,MRK,2,NRSV,now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting and people came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast,you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts to be known and read by all and you show that you are a letter of christ prepared by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts,1
1081,MRK,2,NRSV,jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them can they,and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority,1
1082,MRK,2,NRSV,as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast,yes says the spirit they will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them,1
1083,MRK,2,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast on that day,note then the kindness and the severity of god severity toward those who have fallen but gods kindness toward you provided you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off,1
1084,MRK,2,NRSV,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak otherwise the patch pulls away from it the new from the old and a worse tear is made,do this in remembrance of me,1
1085,MRK,2,NRSV,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost and so are the skins but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins,remember how he told you while he was still in galilee that the son of man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified and on the third day rise again,1
1086,MRK,2,NRSV,one sabbath he was going through the grainfields and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain,so also the son of man is about to suffer at their hands,1
1087,MRK,2,NRSV,the pharisees said to him look why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,so what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed,1
1088,MRK,2,NRSV,and he said to them have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food,for his life is taken away from the earth,1
1089,MRK,2,NRSV,he entered the house of god when abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the presence which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and he gave some to his companions,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,1
1090,MRK,2,NRSV,then he said to them the sabbath was made for humankind and not humankind for the sabbath so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,1
1091,MRK,3,NRSV,again he entered the synagogue and a man was there who had a withered hand,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth,1
1092,MRK,3,NRSV,they watched him to see whether he would cure him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him,so the last will be first and the first will be last,1
1093,MRK,3,NRSV,and he said to the man who had the withered hand come forward,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare,1
1094,MRK,3,NRSV,then he said to them is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to kill,i was dead and see i am alive forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of hades,1
1095,MRK,3,NRSV,he looked around at them with anger he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man stretch out your hand,but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her,1
1096,MRK,3,NRSV,he stretched it out and his hand was restored,in reply he said to them whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none and whoever has food must do likewise,1
1097,MRK,3,NRSV,the pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the herodians against him how to destroy him,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,1
1098,MRK,3,NRSV,jesus departed with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him hearing all that he was doing they came to him in great numbers from judea jerusalem idumea beyond the jordan and the region around tyre and sidon,greet every saint in christ jesus,1
1099,MRK,3,NRSV,he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd so that they would not crush him for he had cured many so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him,after three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions,1
1100,MRK,3,NRSV,whenever the unclean spirits saw him they fell down before him and shouted you are the son of god but he sternly ordered them not to make him known,all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth,1
1101,MRK,3,NRSV,he went up the mountain and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth,1
1102,MRK,3,NRSV,and he appointed twelve whom he also named apostles to be with him and to be sent out to proclaim the message and to have authority to cast out demons,they said to him the son of david,1
1103,MRK,3,NRSV,so he appointed the twelve simon to whom he gave the name peter james son of zebedee and john the brother of james to whom he gave the name boanerges that is sons of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the cananaean and judas iscariot who betrayed him,the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to israel,1
1104,MRK,3,NRSV,then he went home and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat,therefore they will be your judges,1
1105,MRK,3,NRSV,when his family heard it they went out to restrain him for people were saying he has gone out of his mind,whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this that god is true,1
1106,MRK,3,NRSV,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons,then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah,1
1107,MRK,3,NRSV,and he called them to him and spoke to them in parables how can satan cast out satan,this was not because we do not have that right but in order to give you an example to imitate,1
1108,MRK,3,NRSV,if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed,1
1109,MRK,3,NRSV,and if a house is divided against itself that house will not be able to stand,we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves,1
1110,MRK,3,NRSV,and if satan has risen up against himself and is divided he cannot stand but his end has come,they wandered in deserts and mountains and in caves and holes in the ground,1
1111,MRK,3,NRSV,but no one can enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man then indeed the house can be plundered,then calling the saints and widows he showed her to be alive,1
1112,MRK,3,NRSV,truly i tell you people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit can never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin for they had said he has an unclean spirit,now may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word,1
1113,MRK,3,NRSV,then his mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent to him and called him,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later,1
1114,MRK,3,NRSV,a crowd was sitting around him and they said to him your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside asking for you,people were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them and the disciples spoke sternly to them,1
1115,MRK,3,NRSV,and he replied who are my mother and my brothers,he said to him what is written in the law,1
1116,MRK,3,NRSV,and looking at those who sat around him he said here are my mother and my brothers whoever does the will of god is my brother and sister and mother,the pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners,1
1117,MRK,4,NRSV,again he began to teach beside the sea,therefore i tell you people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven,1
1118,MRK,4,NRSV,such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land,a man had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work in the vineyard today,1
1119,MRK,4,NRSV,he began to teach them many things in parables and in his teaching he said to them listen a sower went out to sow,at this they were overcome with amazement,1
1120,MRK,4,NRSV,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for,1
1121,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and it sprang up quickly since it had no depth of soil,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,1
1122,MRK,4,NRSV,and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away,but he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert and house falls on house,1
1123,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain,there is only one who is good,1
1124,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me,1
1125,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said let anyone with ears to hear listen when he was alone those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables,for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed,1
1126,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them to you has been given the secret of the kingdom of god but for those outside everything comes in parables in order that they may indeed look but not perceive and may indeed listen but not understand so that they may not turn again and be forgiven,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead,1
1127,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them do you not understand this parable,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,1
1128,MRK,4,NRSV,then how will you understand all the parables,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy,1
1129,MRK,4,NRSV,these are the ones on the path where the word is sown when they hear satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,1
1130,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on rocky ground when they hear the word they immediately receive it with joy,for those who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to god for nobody understands them since they are speaking mysteries in the spirit,1
1131,MRK,4,NRSV,but they have no root and endure only for a while then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word immediately they fall away,likewise tell the older women to be reverent in behavior not to be slanderers or slaves to drink they are to teach what is good so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children to be selfcontrolled chaste good managers of the household kind being submissive to their husbands so that the word of god may not be discredited,1
1132,MRK,4,NRSV,and others are those sown among the thorns these are the ones who hear the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word and it yields nothing,he did not wish to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him,1
1133,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on the good soil they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold,so let us not grow weary in doing what is right for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up,1
1134,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket or under the bed and not on the lampstand,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection,1
1135,MRK,4,NRSV,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light,peace to all of you who are in christ,1
1136,MRK,4,NRSV,let anyone with ears to hear listen and he said to them pay attention to what you hear the measure you give will be the measure you get and still more will be given you,and everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven,1
1137,MRK,4,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing,1
1138,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how,now the apostles and the believers who were in judea heard that the gentiles had also accepted the word of god,1
1139,MRK,4,NRSV,the earth produces of itself first the stalk then the head then the full grain in the head,you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment,1
1140,MRK,4,NRSV,but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,1
1141,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,jesus answered them do not complain among yourselves,1
1142,MRK,4,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade,then certain individuals came down from judea and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved,1
1143,MRK,4,NRSV,with many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it he did not speak to them except in parables but he explained everything in private to his disciples,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you,1
1144,MRK,4,NRSV,on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go across to the other side,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,1
1145,MRK,4,NRSV,and leaving the crowd behind they took him with them in the boat just as he was,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work,1
1146,MRK,4,NRSV,a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was already being swamped,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh,1
1147,MRK,4,NRSV,but he was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are perishing,there are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one thing and that of the earthly is another,1
1148,MRK,4,NRSV,he woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be still then the wind ceased and there was a dead calm,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead,1
1149,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them why are you afraid,for this reason i sent you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church,1
1150,MRK,4,NRSV,and they were filled with great awe and said to one another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him,do not fear what you are about to suffer,1
1151,MRK,5,NRSV,they came to the other side of the sea to the country of the gerasenes,then jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves,1
1152,MRK,5,NRSV,and when he had stepped out of the boat immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him,or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of siloam fell on themdo you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in jerusalem,1
1153,MRK,5,NRSV,he lived among the tombs and no one could restrain him any more even with a chain for he had often been restrained with shackles and chains but the chains he wrenched apart and the shackles he broke in pieces and no one had the strength to subdue him,coming from the throne are flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches which are the seven spirits of god and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass like crystal,1
1154,MRK,5,NRSV,night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always howling and bruising himself with stones,devout men buried stephen and made loud lamentation over him,1
1155,MRK,5,NRSV,when he saw jesus from a distance he ran and bowed down before him and he shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god,when his family heard it they went out to restrain him for people were saying he has gone out of his mind,1
1156,MRK,5,NRSV,i adjure you by god do not torment me,no i tell you but rather division from now on five in one household will be divided three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw,1
1157,MRK,5,NRSV,for he had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit then jesus asked him what is your name,thus i make it my ambition to proclaim the good news not where christ has already been named so that i do not build on someone elses foundation but as it is written those who have never been told of him shall see and those who have never heard of him shall understand,1
1158,MRK,5,NRSV,he replied my name is legion for we are many,one day as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders and said to him tell us by what authority are you doing these things,1
1159,MRK,5,NRSV,he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country,for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality,1
1160,MRK,5,NRSV,now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding and the unclean spirits begged him send us into the swine let us enter them,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets,1
1161,MRK,5,NRSV,and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine and the herd numbering about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea,so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe,1
1162,MRK,5,NRSV,the swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country,one of the dinner guests on hearing this said to him blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of god then jesus said to him someone gave a great dinner and invited many,1
1163,MRK,5,NRSV,then people came to see what it was that had happened,for though absent in body i am present in spirit and as if present i have already pronounced judgment in the name of the lord jesus on the man who has done such a thing,1
1164,MRK,5,NRSV,they came to jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind the very man who had had the legion and they were afraid,it is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are virgins these follow the lamb wherever he goes,1
1165,MRK,5,NRSV,those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it,and they were afraid to ask him about this saying,1
1166,MRK,5,NRSV,then they began to beg jesus to leave their neighborhood,it was also about these that enoch in the seventh generation from adam prophesied saying see the lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him,1
1167,MRK,5,NRSV,as he was getting into the boat the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him,so also when you see these things taking place you know that he is near at the very gates,1
1168,MRK,5,NRSV,but jesus refused and said to him go home to your friends and tell them how much the lord has done for you and what mercy he has shown you,whoever eats of this bread will live forever and the bread that i will give for the life of the world is my flesh,1
1169,MRK,5,NRSV,and he went away and began to proclaim in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed,i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon so that i may be cheered by news of you,1
1170,MRK,5,NRSV,when jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side a great crowd gathered around him and he was by the sea,they answered him no he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some,1
1171,MRK,5,NRSV,then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly my little daughter is at the point of death,but strive for the greater gifts,1
1172,MRK,5,NRSV,come and lay your hands on her so that she may be made well and live,does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks,1
1173,MRK,5,NRSV,and a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him,but by refusing to be baptized by him the pharisees and the lawyers rejected gods purpose for themselves to what then will i compare the people of this generation and what are they like,1
1174,MRK,5,NRSV,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years,when they heard him addressing them in hebrew they became even more quiet,1
1175,MRK,5,NRSV,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse,now when these things begin to take place stand up and raise your heads because your redemption is drawing near,1
1176,MRK,5,NRSV,she had heard about jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak for she said if i but touch his clothes i will be made well,as it is written in the prophet isaiah see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight john the baptizer appeared in the wilderness proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,1
1177,MRK,5,NRSV,immediately her hemorrhage stopped and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease,blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe,1
1178,MRK,5,NRSV,immediately aware that power had gone forth from him jesus turned about in the crowd and said who touched my clothes,so my friends be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues but all things should be done decently and in order,1
1179,MRK,5,NRSV,and his disciples said to him you see the crowd pressing in on you how can you say who touched me,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing,1
1180,MRK,5,NRSV,he looked all around to see who had done it,when they persecute you in one town flee to the next for truly i tell you you will not have gone through all the towns of israel before the son of man comes,1
1181,MRK,5,NRSV,but the woman knowing what had happened to her came in fear and trembling fell down before him and told him the whole truth,but peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves then he went home amazed at what had happened,1
1182,MRK,5,NRSV,he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be healed of your disease,the very night before herod was going to bring him out peter bound with two chains was sleeping between two soldiers while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison,1
1183,MRK,5,NRSV,while he was still speaking some people came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead,do not be astonished that i said to you you must be born from above,1
1184,MRK,5,NRSV,why trouble the teacher any further,therefore beloved while you are waiting for these things strive to be found by him at peace without spot or blemish and regard the patience of our lord as salvation,1
1185,MRK,5,NRSV,but overhearing what they said jesus said to the leader of the synagogue do not fear only believe,jesus went through one town and village after another teaching as he made his way to jerusalem,1
1186,MRK,5,NRSV,he allowed no one to follow him except peter james and john the brother of james,from noon on darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,1
1187,MRK,5,NRSV,when they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue he saw a commotion people weeping and wailing loudly,and let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs so that they may not be unproductive,1
1188,MRK,5,NRSV,when he had entered he said to them why do you make a commotion and weep,those who eat must not despise those who abstain and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat for god has welcomed them,1
1189,MRK,5,NRSV,the child is not dead but sleeping,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do,1
1190,MRK,5,NRSV,then he put them all outside and took the childs father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was,i am the alpha and the omega says the lord god who is and who was and who is to come the almighty,1
1191,MRK,5,NRSV,he took her by the hand and said to her talitha cum which means little girl get up and immediately the girl got up and began to walk about she was twelve years of age,but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about,1
1192,MRK,5,NRSV,at this they were overcome with amazement,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given,1
1193,MRK,5,NRSV,he strictly ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat,and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people that is from their kindred though these also are descended from abraham,1
1194,MRK,6,NRSV,he left that place and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him,now that day was a sabbath,1
1195,MRK,6,NRSV,on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astounded,the king was grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he commanded it to be given he sent and had john beheaded in the prison,1
1196,MRK,6,NRSV,they said where did this man get all this,if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your mind,1
1197,MRK,6,NRSV,what is this wisdom that has been given to him,we want you to know brothers and sisters about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part,1
1198,MRK,6,NRSV,what deeds of power are being done by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us,like obedient children do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance,1
1199,MRK,6,NRSV,and they took offense at him,they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to dieyet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them,1
1200,MRK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,1
1201,MRK,6,NRSV,and he could do no deed of power there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them,this is the reason that i have so often been hindered from coming to you,1
1202,MRK,6,NRSV,and he was amazed at their unbelief,but you have kept the good wine until now,1
1203,MRK,6,NRSV,then he went about among the villages teaching,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this,1
1204,MRK,6,NRSV,he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying,1
1205,MRK,6,NRSV,he ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics,then turning toward the woman he said to simon do you see this woman,1
1206,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place,i went up in response to a revelation,1
1207,MRK,6,NRSV,if any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you as you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them,no not at all for we have already charged that all both jews and greeks are under the power of sin as it is written there is no one who is righteous not even one there is no one who has understanding there is no one who seeks god,1
1208,MRK,6,NRSV,so they went out and proclaimed that all should repent,he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery,1
1209,MRK,6,NRSV,they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them,he stretched it out and his hand was restored,1
1210,MRK,6,NRSV,king herod heard of it for jesus name had become known,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it,1
1211,MRK,6,NRSV,some were saying john the baptizer has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,1
1212,MRK,6,NRSV,but others said it is elijah,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1
1213,MRK,6,NRSV,and others said it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old,now the works of the flesh are obvious fornication impurity licentiousness idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousy anger quarrels dissensions factions envy drunkenness carousing and things like these,1
1214,MRK,6,NRSV,but when herod heard of it he said john whom i beheaded has been raised,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments,1
1215,MRK,6,NRSV,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod had married her,in the days of king herod of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of abijah,1
1216,MRK,6,NRSV,for john had been telling herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife,so he got into the boat and returned,1
1217,MRK,6,NRSV,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him,when he had said this he died,1
1218,MRK,6,NRSV,but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and he protected him,there are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world and nothing is without sound,1
1219,MRK,6,NRSV,when he heard him he was greatly perplexed and yet he liked to listen to him,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,1
1220,MRK,6,NRSV,but an opportunity came when herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of galilee,and there appeared to them elijah with moses who were talking with jesus,1
1221,MRK,6,NRSV,when his daughter herodias came in and danced she pleased herod and his guests and the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you wish and i will give it,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,1
1222,MRK,6,NRSV,and he solemnly swore to her whatever you ask me i will give you even half of my kingdom,carry no purse no bag no sandals and greet no one on the road,1
1223,MRK,6,NRSV,she went out and said to her mother what should i ask for,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you,1
1224,MRK,6,NRSV,she replied the head of john the baptizer,if i have told you about earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if i tell you about heavenly things,1
1225,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately she rushed back to the king and requested i want you to give me at once the head of john the baptist on a platter,these six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the mans house,1
1226,MRK,6,NRSV,the king was deeply grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he did not want to refuse her,so those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them,1
1227,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring johns head,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,1
1228,MRK,6,NRSV,he went and beheaded him in the prison brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl,and to what should i compare it,1
1229,MRK,6,NRSV,then the girl gave it to her mother,since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous because even the fast had already gone by paul advised them saying sirs i can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives,1
1230,MRK,6,NRSV,when his disciples heard about it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb,they went to him and woke him up shouting master master we are perishing and he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves they ceased and there was a calm,1
1231,MRK,6,NRSV,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught,peter began to say to him look we have left everything and followed you,1
1232,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become,1
1233,MRK,6,NRSV,for many were coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat,or why are you speaking with her,1
1234,MRK,6,NRSV,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight,1
1235,MRK,6,NRSV,now many saw them going and recognized them and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground,1
1236,MRK,6,NRSV,as he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things,but they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony for they did not cling to life even in the face of death,1
1237,MRK,6,NRSV,when it grew late his disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now very late send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy something for themselves to eat,we are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not driven to despair persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed always carrying in the body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be made visible in our bodies,1
1238,MRK,6,NRSV,but he answered them you give them something to eat,and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full,1
1239,MRK,6,NRSV,they said to him are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat,jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of caesarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples who do people say that i am,1
1240,MRK,6,NRSV,and he said to them how many loaves have you,blessed are those who wash their robes so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates,1
1241,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had found out they said five and two fish,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up,1
1242,MRK,6,NRSV,then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass,but nothing unclean will enter it nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood but only those who are written in the lambs book of life,1
1243,MRK,6,NRSV,so they sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments,1
1244,MRK,6,NRSV,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and he divided the two fish among them all,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked,1
1245,MRK,6,NRSV,and all ate and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish,for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ,1
1246,MRK,6,NRSV,those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men,when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul,1
1247,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd,when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch,1
1248,MRK,6,NRSV,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,but i will warn you whom to fear fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell,1
1249,MRK,6,NRSV,when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land,do you have eyes and fail to see,1
1250,MRK,6,NRSV,when he saw that they were straining at the oars against an adverse wind he came towards them early in the morning walking on the sea,was not our ancestor abraham justified by works when he offered his son isaac on the altar,1
1251,MRK,6,NRSV,he intended to pass them by,now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding and the unclean spirits begged him send us into the swine let us enter them,1
1252,MRK,6,NRSV,but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and cried out for they all saw him and were terrified,you have laid up treasure for the last days,1
1253,MRK,6,NRSV,but immediately he spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,1
1254,MRK,6,NRSV,then he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased,jesus said to him stand up take your mat and walk,1
1255,MRK,6,NRSV,and they were utterly astounded for they did not understand about the loaves but their hearts were hardened,as they came near the village to which they were going he walked ahead as if he were going on,1
1256,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret and moored the boat,this calls for a mind that has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated also they are seven kings of whom five have fallen one is living and the other has not yet come and when he comes he must remain only a little while,1
1257,MRK,6,NRSV,when they got out of the boat people at once recognized him and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was,and he said to me these words are trustworthy and true for the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place,1
1258,MRK,6,NRSV,and wherever he went into villages or cities or farms they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,1
1259,MRK,7,NRSV,now when the pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from jerusalem gathered around him they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands that is without washing them,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea,1
1260,MRK,7,NRSV,for the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands thus observing the tradition of the elders and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it and there are also many other traditions that they observe the washing of cups pots and bronze kettles,then people will come from east and west from north and south and will eat in the kingdom of god,1
1261,MRK,7,NRSV, so the pharisees and the scribes asked him why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders but eat with defiled hands,he said to him what is written in the law,1
1262,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to them isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their hearts are far from me in vain do they worship me teaching human precepts as doctrines,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days,1
1263,MRK,7,NRSV,you abandon the commandment of god and hold to human tradition,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him,1
1264,MRK,7,NRSV,then he said to them you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition for moses said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die,you have laid up treasure for the last days,1
1265,MRK,7,NRSV,but you say that if anyone tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is corban that is an offering to god then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother thus making void the word of god through your tradition that you have handed on,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him,1
1266,MRK,7,NRSV,and you do many things like this,the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every jewel the first was jasper the second sapphire the third agate the fourth emerald the fifth onyx the sixth carnelian the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth the twelfth amethyst,1
1267,MRK,7,NRSV,then he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives,1
1268,MRK,7,NRSV,when he had left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about the parable,greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them,1
1269,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to them then do you also fail to understand,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh,1
1270,MRK,7,NRSV,do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile since it enters not the heart but the stomach and goes out into the sewer,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1
1271,MRK,7,NRSV,thus he declared all foods clean and he said it is what comes out of a person that defiles,but among you there are some who do not believe,1
1272,MRK,7,NRSV,for it is from within from the human heart that evil intentions come fornication theft murder adultery avarice wickedness deceit licentiousness envy slander pride folly,and besides other things i am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches,1
1273,MRK,7,NRSV,all these evil things come from within and they defile a person,jesus said to them i will ask you one question answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things,1
1274,MRK,7,NRSV,from there he set out and went away to the region of tyre,then jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham,1
1275,MRK,7,NRSV,he entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there,from morning until evening he explained the matter to them testifying to the kingdom of god and trying to convince them about jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets,1
1276,MRK,7,NRSV,yet he could not escape notice but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and she came and bowed down at his feet,then the lord said to him take off the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground,1
1277,MRK,7,NRSV,now the woman was a gentile of syrophoenician origin,when peter saw him he said to jesus lord what about him,1
1278,MRK,7,NRSV,she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter,mary magdalene went and announced to the disciples i have seen the lord and she told them that he had said these things to her,1
1279,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to her let the children be fed first for it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs,all who cleanse themselves of the things i have mentioned will become special utensils dedicated and useful to the owner of the house ready for every good work,1
1280,MRK,7,NRSV,but she answered him sir even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs,the next day he went on with barnabas to derbe,1
1281,MRK,7,NRSV,then he said to her for saying that you may gothe demon has left your daughter,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back,1
1282,MRK,7,NRSV,so she went home found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone,it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his dwelling that is those who dwell in heaven,1
1283,MRK,7,NRSV,then he returned from the region of tyre and went by way of sidon towards the sea of galilee in the region of the decapolis,that one is like a man building a house who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock when a flood arose the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built,1
1284,MRK,7,NRSV,they brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech and they begged him to lay his hand on him,he said this to test him for he himself knew what he was going to do,1
1285,MRK,7,NRSV,he took him aside in private away from the crowd and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue,in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots,1
1286,MRK,7,NRSV,then looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him ephphatha that is be opened,and in this matter i am giving my advice it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something now finish doing it so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means,1
1287,MRK,7,NRSV,and immediately his ears were opened his tongue was released and he spoke plainly,we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete,1
1288,MRK,7,NRSV,then jesus ordered them to tell no one but the more he ordered them the more zealously they proclaimed it,his father came out and began to plead with him,1
1289,MRK,7,NRSV,they were astounded beyond measure saying he has done everything well he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,1
1290,MRK,8,NRSV,in those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat he called his disciples and said to them i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat,suddenly jesus met them and said greetings and they came to him took hold of his feet and worshiped him,1
1291,MRK,8,NRSV,if i send them away hungry to their homes they will faint on the wayand some of them have come from a great distance,resist the devil and he will flee from you,1
1292,MRK,8,NRSV,his disciples replied how can one feed these people with bread here in the desert,as he was saying these things many believed in him,1
1293,MRK,8,NRSV,he asked them how many loaves do you have,so they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea,1
1294,MRK,8,NRSV,then he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute and they distributed them to the crowd,it is the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life they will wither away,1
1295,MRK,8,NRSV,they had also a few small fish and after blessing them he ordered that these too should be distributed,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,1
1296,MRK,8,NRSV,they ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full,of these things we cannot speak now in detail,1
1297,MRK,8,NRSV,now there were about four thousand people,for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard,1
1298,MRK,8,NRSV,and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of dalmanutha,so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace,1
1299,MRK,8,NRSV,the pharisees came and began to argue with him asking him for a sign from heaven to test him,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,1
1300,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sighed deeply in his spirit and said why does this generation ask for a sign,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings,1
1301,MRK,8,NRSV,truly i tell you no sign will be given to this generation,and all ate and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish,1
1302,MRK,8,NRSV,and he left them and getting into the boat again he went across to the other side,although the doors were shut jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you,1
1303,MRK,8,NRSV,now the disciples had forgotten to bring any bread and they had only one loaf with them in the boat,at that time the festival of the dedication took place in jerusalem,1
1304,MRK,8,NRSV,and he cautioned them saying watch outbeware of the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod,and they laughed at him knowing that she was dead,1
1305,MRK,8,NRSV,they said to one another it is because we have no bread,his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation,1
1306,MRK,8,NRSV,and becoming aware of it jesus said to them why are you talking about having no bread,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you,1
1307,MRK,8,NRSV,do you still not perceive or understand,all of them deserted him and fled,1
1308,MRK,8,NRSV,do you have eyes and fail to see,now as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in utmost eagerness and in our love for you so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking,1
1309,MRK,8,NRSV,do you have ears and fail to hear,the pharisees came and began to argue with him asking him for a sign from heaven to test him,1
1310,MRK,8,NRSV,when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect,for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god,1
1311,MRK,8,NRSV,and the seven for the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink,1
1312,MRK,8,NRSV,and they said to him seven,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,1
1313,MRK,8,NRSV,then he said to them do you not yet understand,and the dead were judged according to their works as recorded in the books,1
1314,MRK,8,NRSV,some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him,in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood,1
1315,MRK,8,NRSV,he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him can you see anything,the purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor abraham had before he was circumcised,1
1316,MRK,8,NRSV,and the man looked up and said i can see people but they look like trees walking,they have been redeemed from humankind as first fruits for god and the lamb and in their mouth no lie was found they are blameless,1
1317,MRK,8,NRSV,then jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and he looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation,1
1318,MRK,8,NRSV,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house,1
1319,MRK,8,NRSV,jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of caesarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples who do people say that i am,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,1
1320,MRK,8,NRSV,and they answered him john the baptist and others elijah and still others one of the prophets,when they had assembled he said to them brothers though i had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors yet i was arrested in jerusalem and handed over to the romans,1
1321,MRK,8,NRSV,he asked them but who do you say that i am,anyone who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses,1
1322,MRK,8,NRSV,peter answered him you are the messiah,no one who abides in him sins no one who sins has either seen him or known him,1
1323,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him,its number is six hundred sixtysix,1
1324,MRK,8,NRSV,then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,if anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancee if his passions are strong and so it has to be let him marry as he wishes it is no sin,1
1325,MRK,8,NRSV,he said all this quite openly,just this that in my proclamation i may make the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel,1
1326,MRK,8,NRSV,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him,but now that you say we see your sin remains,1
1327,MRK,8,NRSV,but turning and looking at his disciples he rebuked peter and said get behind me satan for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,i came to bring fire to the earth and how i wish it were already kindled i have a baptism with which to be baptized and what stress i am under until it is completed do you think that i have come to bring peace to the earth,1
1328,MRK,8,NRSV,he called the crowd with his disciples and said to them if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me,how did he open your eyes,1
1329,MRK,8,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel will save it,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,1
1330,MRK,8,NRSV,for what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life,i do not call you servants any longer because the servant does not know what the master is doing but i have called you friends because i have made known to you everything that i have heard from my father,1
1331,MRK,8,NRSV,indeed what can they give in return for their life,when we came into rome paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him,1
1332,MRK,8,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of them the son of man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels,he said to them elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things,1
1333,MRK,9,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of god has come with power,but if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of god what should we say,1
1334,MRK,9,NRSV,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and john and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves,the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him,1
1335,MRK,9,NRSV,and he was transfigured before them and his clothes became dazzling white such as no one on earth could bleach them,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the advocate will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you,1
1336,MRK,9,NRSV,and there appeared to them elijah with moses who were talking with jesus,very truly i tell you if you ask anything of the father in my name he will give it to you,1
1337,MRK,9,NRSV,then peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijah,while they were eating jesus took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body,1
1338,MRK,9,NRSV,he did not know what to say for they were terrified,so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs,1
1339,MRK,9,NRSV,then a cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud there came a voice this is my son the beloved listen to him suddenly when they looked around they saw no one with them any more but only jesus,for we wanted to come to youcertainly i paul wanted to again and againbut satan blocked our way,1
1340,MRK,9,NRSV,as they were coming down the mountain he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen until after the son of man had risen from the dead,such is the confidence that we have through christ toward god,1
1341,MRK,9,NRSV,so they kept the matter to themselves questioning what this rising from the dead could mean,then peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb,1
1342,MRK,9,NRSV,then they asked him why do the scribes say that elijah must come first,for if joshua had given them rest god would not speak later about another day,1
1343,MRK,9,NRSV,he said to them elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things,then they said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings,1
1344,MRK,9,NRSV,how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt,so the word of the lord grew mightily and prevailed,1
1345,MRK,9,NRSV,but i tell you that elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased as it is written about him,if god has been glorified in him god will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once,1
1346,MRK,9,NRSV,when they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them,therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god indeed he has prepared a city for them,1
1347,MRK,9,NRSV,when the whole crowd saw him they were immediately overcome with awe and they ran forward to greet him,or are you the only ones it has reached anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must acknowledge that what i am writing to you is a command of the lord,1
1348,MRK,9,NRSV,he asked them what are you arguing about with them,we put in at syracuse and stayed there for three days then we weighed anchor and came to rhegium,1
1349,MRK,9,NRSV,someone from the crowd answered him teacher i brought you my son he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak and whenever it seizes him it dashes him down and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid and i asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do so,he was indeed so ill that he nearly died,1
1350,MRK,9,NRSV,he answered them you faithless generation how much longer must i be among you,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,1
1351,MRK,9,NRSV,how much longer must i put up with you,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,1
1352,MRK,9,NRSV,and they brought the boy to him,the one who comes from above is above all the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things,1
1353,MRK,9,NRSV,when the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy and he fell on the ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth,jesus answered them go and tell john what you hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have good news brought to them,1
1354,MRK,9,NRSV,jesus asked the father how long has this been happening to him,but he said to them my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it,1
1355,MRK,9,NRSV,it has often cast him into the fire and into the water to destroy him but if you are able to do anything have pity on us and help us,they went out from us but they did not belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us,1
1356,MRK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him if you are ableall things can be done for the one who believes,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light,1
1357,MRK,9,NRSV,immediately the father of the child cried out i believe help my unbelief when jesus saw that a crowd came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it you spirit that keeps this boy from speaking and hearing i command you come out of him and never enter him again after crying out and convulsing him terribly it came out and the boy was like a corpse so that most of them said he is dead,so who then are you to judge your neighbor,1
1358,MRK,9,NRSV,but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he was able to stand,if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love,1
1359,MRK,9,NRSV,when he had entered the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast it out,although i am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to me to bring to the gentiles the news of the boundless riches of christ and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in god who created all things so that through the church the wisdom of god in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places,1
1360,MRK,9,NRSV,he said to them this kind can come out only through prayer,when he knocked at the outer gate a maid named rhoda came to answer,1
1361,MRK,9,NRSV,they went on from there and passed through galilee,when they had gone through the whole island as far as paphos they met a certain magician a jewish false prophet named barjesus,1
1362,MRK,9,NRSV,he did not want anyone to know it for he was teaching his disciples saying to them the son of man is to be betrayed into human hands and they will kill him and three days after being killed he will rise again,i repeat let no one think that i am a fool but if you do then accept me as a fool so that i too may boast a little,1
1363,MRK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him,the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegrooms voice,1
1364,MRK,9,NRSV,then they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them what were you arguing about on the way,in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god,1
1365,MRK,9,NRSV,but they were silent for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest,they seized paul and dragged him out of the temple and immediately the doors were shut,1
1366,MRK,9,NRSV,he sat down called the twelve and said to them whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all,for we know the one who said vengeance is mine i will repay,1
1367,MRK,9,NRSV,then he took a little child and put it among them and taking it in his arms he said to them whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me,and there appeared to them elijah with moses who were talking with jesus,1
1368,MRK,9,NRSV,john said to him teacher we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he was not following us,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,1
1369,MRK,9,NRSV,but jesus said do not stop him for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me,but to which of the angels has he ever said sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet,1
1370,MRK,9,NRSV,whoever is not against us is for us,i will make those of the synagogue of satan who say that they are jews and are not but are lyingi will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that i have loved you,1
1371,MRK,9,NRSV,for truly i tell you whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of christ will by no means lose the reward,jesus said to them you cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them can you,1
1372,MRK,9,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea,and he came to her and said greetings favored one the lord is with you,1
1373,MRK,9,NRSV,if your hand causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell to the unquenchable fire,then many will fall away and they will betray one another and hate one another,1
1374,MRK,9,NRSV,and if your foot causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell,he said to his disciples therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear,1
1375,MRK,9,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,1
1376,MRK,9,NRSV,for everyone will be salted with fire,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,1
1377,MRK,9,NRSV,salt is good but if salt has lost its saltiness how can you season it,but i refrain from it so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me even considering the exceptional character of the revelations,1
1378,MRK,9,NRSV,have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me,1
1379,MRK,10,NRSV,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan,for just as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is also dead,1
1380,MRK,10,NRSV,and crowds again gathered around him and as was his custom he again taught them,now get up go down and go with them without hesitation for i have sent them,1
1381,MRK,10,NRSV,some pharisees came and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife,after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and for five months she remained in seclusion,1
1382,MRK,10,NRSV,he answered them what did moses command you,but when this son of yours came back who has devoured your property with prostitutes you killed the fatted calf for him then the father said to him son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours,1
1383,MRK,10,NRSV,they said moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt,1
1384,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,1
1385,MRK,10,NRSV,but from the beginning of creation god made them male and female,i have given them your word and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world,1
1386,MRK,10,NRSV,for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh,as it is written for your sake we are being killed all day long we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered,1
1387,MRK,10,NRSV,so they are no longer two but one flesh,for all of us make many mistakes,1
1388,MRK,10,NRSV,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate,and he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down,1
1389,MRK,10,NRSV,then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter,the tribune came and asked paul tell me are you a roman citizen,1
1390,MRK,10,NRSV,he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery,the tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,1
1391,MRK,10,NRSV,people were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them and the disciples spoke sternly to them,however so that we do not give offense to them go to the sea and cast a hook take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a coin take that and give it to them for you and me,1
1392,MRK,10,NRSV,but when jesus saw this he was indignant and said to them let the little children come to me do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs,i urge you all the more to do this so that i may be restored to you very soon,1
1393,MRK,10,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,or do you show contempt for the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing,1
1394,MRK,10,NRSV,and he took them up in his arms laid his hands on them and blessed them,pilate answered what i have written i have written,1
1395,MRK,10,NRSV,as he was setting out on a journey a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given,1
1396,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good,for this reason i said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you,1
1397,MRK,10,NRSV,no one is good but god alone,its gates will never be shut by dayand there will be no night there,1
1398,MRK,10,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness you shall not defraud honor your father and mother,to the weak i became weak so that i might win the weak,1
1399,MRK,10,NRSV,he said to him teacher i have kept all these since my youth,remain in the same house eating and drinking whatever they provide for the laborer deserves to be paid,1
1400,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus looking at him loved him and said you lack one thing go sell what you own and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened,1
1401,MRK,10,NRSV,when he heard this he was shocked and went away grieving for he had many possessions,epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus greets you,1
1402,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god and the disciples were perplexed at these words,while peter was kept in prison the church prayed fervently to god for him,1
1403,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them again children how hard it is to enter the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,but as for that in the good soil these are the ones who when they hear the word hold it fast in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patient endurance,1
1404,MRK,10,NRSV,they were greatly astounded and said to one another then who can be saved,but we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters beloved by the lord because god chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and through belief in the truth,1
1405,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but not for god for god all things are possible,yes and i ask you also my loyal companion help these women for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel together with clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life,1
1406,MRK,10,NRSV,peter began to say to him look we have left everything and followed you,philip answered him six months wages would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little,1
1407,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not receive a hundredfold now in this agehouses brothers and sisters mothers and children and fields with persecutionsand in the age to come eternal life,come lord jesus the grace of the lord jesus be with all the saints,1
1408,MRK,10,NRSV,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first,now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to make you stand without blemish in the presence of his glory with rejoicing to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord be glory majesty power and authority before all time and now and forever,1
1409,MRK,10,NRSV,they were on the road going up to jerusalem and jesus was walking ahead of them they were amazed and those who followed were afraid,but when this son of yours came back who has devoured your property with prostitutes you killed the fatted calf for him then the father said to him son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours,1
1410,MRK,10,NRSV,he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him saying see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles they will mock him and spit upon him and flog him and kill him and after three days he will rise again,blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes truly i tell you he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat and he will come and serve them,1
1411,MRK,10,NRSV,james and john the sons of zebedee came forward to him and said to him teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea,1
1412,MRK,10,NRSV,and he said to them what is it you want me to do for you,they bestowed many honors on us and when we were about to sail they put on board all the provisions we needed,1
1413,MRK,10,NRSV,and they said to him grant us to sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory,his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind,1
1414,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them you do not know what you are asking,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and john and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves,1
1415,MRK,10,NRSV,are you able to drink the cup that i drink or be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with,do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me,1
1416,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus said to them the cup that i drink you will drink and with the baptism with which i am baptized you will be baptized but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant but it is for those for whom it has been prepared,what do you mean by saying you will be made free,1
1417,MRK,10,NRSV,when the ten heard this they began to be angry with james and john,when they had brought them they had them stand before the council,1
1418,MRK,10,NRSV,so jesus called them and said to them you know that among the gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them,it was your eyes he opened,1
1419,MRK,10,NRSV,but it is not so among you but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all,for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed,1
1420,MRK,10,NRSV,for the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,1
1421,MRK,10,NRSV,as he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving jericho bartimaeus son of timaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside,so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing tychicus will tell you everything,1
1422,MRK,10,NRSV,when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to shout out and say jesus son of david have mercy on me many sternly ordered him to be quiet but he cried out even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and said call him here,the pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners,1
1423,MRK,10,NRSV,and they called the blind man saying to him take heart get up he is calling you,for i know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh,1
1424,MRK,10,NRSV,so throwing off his cloak he sprang up and came to jesus,yet all these though they were commended for their faith did not receive what was promised since god had provided something better so that they would not apart from us be made perfect,1
1425,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus said to him what do you want me to do for you,so therefore none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions,1
1426,MRK,10,NRSV,the blind man said to him my teacher let me see again,while jesus was teaching in the temple he said how can the scribes say that the messiah is the son of david,1
1427,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him go your faith has made you well,and he came to her and said greetings favored one the lord is with you,1
1428,MRK,10,NRSV,immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way,the women who had come with him from galilee followed and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid,1
1429,MRK,11,NRSV,when they were approaching jerusalem at bethphage and bethany near the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,1
1430,MRK,11,NRSV,if anyone says to you why are you doing this,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus,1
1431,MRK,11,NRSV,just say this the lord needs it and will send it back here immediately,i have been paid in full and have more than enough i am fully satisfied now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to god,1
1432,MRK,11,NRSV,they went away and found a colt tied near a door outside in the street,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him,1
1433,MRK,11,NRSV,as they were untying it some of the bystanders said to them what are you doing untying the colt,the bread that we break is it not a sharing in the body of christ,1
1434,MRK,11,NRSV,they told them what jesus had said and they allowed them to take it,again i ask did israel not understand,1
1435,MRK,11,NRSV,then they brought the colt to jesus and threw their cloaks on it and he sat on it,do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me,1
1436,MRK,11,NRSV,many people spread their cloaks on the road and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god,1
1437,MRK,11,NRSV,then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor david hosanna in the highest heaven then he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve,he said to them because of your little faith,1
1438,MRK,11,NRSV,on the following day when they came from bethany he was hungry,the first angel blew his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and they were hurled to the earth and a third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up,1
1439,MRK,11,NRSV,seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf he went to see whether perhaps he would find anything on it,then they went on to another village,1
1440,MRK,11,NRSV,when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs,then he came to the disciples and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest,1
1441,MRK,11,NRSV,he said to it may no one ever eat fruit from you again,greet one another with a holy kiss,1
1442,MRK,11,NRSV,and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple,i guarded them and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost so that the scripture might be fulfilled,1
1443,MRK,11,NRSV,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations,he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end,1
1444,MRK,11,NRSV,but you have made it a den of robbers,for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves,1
1445,MRK,11,NRSV,and when the chief priests and the scribes heard it they kept looking for a way to kill him for they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching,so faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes through the word of christ,1
1446,MRK,11,NRSV,and when evening came jesus and his disciples went out of the city,but judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor,1
1447,MRK,11,NRSV,in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots,it convulses him until he foams at the mouth it mauls him and will scarcely leave him,1
1448,MRK,11,NRSV,then peter remembered and said to him rabbi look the fig tree that you cursed has withered,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later,1
1449,MRK,11,NRSV,jesus answered them have faith in god,immediately she rushed back to the king and requested i want you to give me at once the head of john the baptist on a platter,1
1450,MRK,11,NRSV,truly i tell you if you say to this mountain be taken up and thrown into the sea and if you do not doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass it will be done for you,although he had performed so many signs in their presence they did not believe in him,1
1451,MRK,11,NRSV,so i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours,the father loves the son and has placed all things in his hands,1
1452,MRK,11,NRSV,whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses,then jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe,1
1453,MRK,11,NRSV,as he was walking in the temple the chief priests the scribes and the elders came to him and said by what authority are you doing these things,as for this worthless slave throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1
1454,MRK,11,NRSV,who gave you this authority to do them,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth,1
1455,MRK,11,NRSV,jesus said to them i will ask you one question answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things,but i tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom than for you,1
1456,MRK,11,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,yes of gentiles also since god is one and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith,1
1457,MRK,11,NRSV,they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not believe him,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,1
1458,MRK,11,NRSV,but shall we say of human originthey were afraid of the crowd for all regarded john as truly a prophet,he is the true god and eternal life,1
1459,MRK,11,NRSV,so they answered jesus we do not know,i warned those who sinned previously and all the others and i warn them now while absent as i did when present on my second visit that if i come again i will not be lenient since you desire proof that christ is speaking in me,1
1460,MRK,11,NRSV,and jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from,1
1461,MRK,12,NRSV,then he began to speak to them in parables,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days,1
1462,MRK,12,NRSV,a man planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a pit for the wine press and built a watchtower then he leased it to tenants and went to another country,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,1
1463,MRK,12,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard,otherwise if you say a blessing with the spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the amen to your thanksgiving since the outsider does not know what you are saying,1
1464,MRK,12,NRSV,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,but when you are invited go and sit down at the lowest place so that when your host comes he may say to you friend move up higher then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you,1
1465,MRK,12,NRSV,and again he sent another slave to them this one they beat over the head and insulted,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,1
1466,MRK,12,NRSV,then he sent another and that one they killed,until i arrive give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhorting to teaching,1
1467,MRK,12,NRSV,and so it was with many others some they beat and others they killed,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god,1
1468,MRK,12,NRSV,he had still one other a beloved son,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior,1
1469,MRK,12,NRSV,finally he sent him to them saying they will respect my son,for you will be speaking into the air,1
1470,MRK,12,NRSV,but those tenants said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that,1
1471,MRK,12,NRSV,so they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard,finally beloved whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever is commendable if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things,1
1472,MRK,12,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened,1
1473,MRK,12,NRSV,he will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others,now discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it,1
1474,MRK,12,NRSV,have you not read this scripture the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the lords doing and it is amazing in our eyes,then he left the country of the chaldeans and settled in haran,1
1475,MRK,12,NRSV,when they realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowd,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me,1
1476,MRK,12,NRSV,so they left him and went away,and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority,1
1477,MRK,12,NRSV,then they sent to him some pharisees and some herodians to trap him in what he said,then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there and he said it is written my house shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers,1
1478,MRK,12,NRSV,and they came and said to him teacher we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with truth,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1
1479,MRK,12,NRSV,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not,they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah who is over all god blessed forever,1
1480,MRK,12,NRSV,should we pay them or should we not,for to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1
1481,MRK,12,NRSV,but knowing their hypocrisy he said to them why are you putting me to the test,many of them were saying he has a demon and is out of his mind,1
1482,MRK,12,NRSV,bring me a denarius and let me see it,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
1483,MRK,12,NRSV,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1
1484,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods,when the people saw the sign that he had done they began to say this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world,1
1485,MRK,12,NRSV,and they were utterly amazed at him,they said lord look here are two swords,1
1486,MRK,12,NRSV,some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question saying teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no child the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,and all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple,1
1487,MRK,12,NRSV,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise none of the seven left children,when peter saw it he addressed the people you israelites why do you wonder at this or why do you stare at us as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk,1
1488,MRK,12,NRSV,last of all the woman herself died,therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that after we have examined him i may have something to write for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him,1
1489,MRK,12,NRSV,in the resurrection whose wife will she be,they do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,1
1490,MRK,12,NRSV,for the seven had married her,so he consented and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present,1
1491,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them is not this the reason you are wrong that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,1
1492,MRK,12,NRSV,for when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself,1
1493,MRK,12,NRSV,and as for the dead being raised have you not read in the book of moses in the story about the bush how god said to him i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,1
1494,MRK,12,NRSV,he is god not of the dead but of the living you are quite wrong,greet one another with a holy kiss,1
1495,MRK,12,NRSV,one of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well he asked him which commandment is the first of all,neither was man created for the sake of woman but woman for the sake of man,1
1496,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength,king agrippa do you believe the prophets,1
1497,MRK,12,NRSV,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit,1
1498,MRK,12,NRSV,there is no other commandment greater than these,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,1
1499,MRK,12,NRSV,then the scribe said to him you are right teacher you have truly said that he is one and besides him there is no other and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneselfthis is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,he said to them it was because you were so hardhearted that moses allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so,1
1500,MRK,12,NRSV,when jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god,the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in turmoil asking who is this,1
1501,MRK,12,NRSV,after that no one dared to ask him any question,for what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life,1
1502,MRK,12,NRSV,while jesus was teaching in the temple he said how can the scribes say that the messiah is the son of david,i entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair,1
1503,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself by the holy spirit declared the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1
1504,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself calls him lord so how can he be his son,but of the son he says your throne o god is forever and ever and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom,1
1505,MRK,12,NRSV,and the large crowd was listening to him with delight,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,1
1506,MRK,12,NRSV,as he taught he said beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him,1
1507,MRK,12,NRSV,they will receive the greater condemnation,let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others,1
1508,MRK,12,NRSV,he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury,when they hand you over do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say for what you are to say will be given to you at that time for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you,1
1509,MRK,12,NRSV,many rich people put in large sums,those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of gods spirit for they are foolishness to them and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned,1
1510,MRK,12,NRSV,a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which are worth a penny,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss,1
1511,MRK,12,NRSV,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury,but the throne of god and of the lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads,1
1512,MRK,12,NRSV,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1
1513,MRK,13,NRSV,as he came out of the temple one of his disciples said to him look teacher what large stones and what large buildings then jesus asked him do you see these great buildings,therefore to keep me from being too elated a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to torment me to keep me from being too elated,1
1514,MRK,13,NRSV,not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down,but be alert i have already told you everything,1
1515,MRK,13,NRSV,when he was sitting on the mount of olives opposite the temple peter james john and andrew asked him privately tell us when will this be and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished,as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go,1
1516,MRK,13,NRSV,then jesus began to say to them beware that no one leads you astray,you blind fools for which is greater the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred,1
1517,MRK,13,NRSV,many will come in my name and say i am he and they will lead many astray,just as it was in the days of noah so too it will be in the days of the son of man,1
1518,MRK,13,NRSV,when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed this must take place but the end is still to come,there was much weeping among them all they embraced paul and kissed him grieving especially because of what he had said that they would not see him again,1
1519,MRK,13,NRSV,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in various places there will be famines,those who passed by derided him shaking their heads and saying aha you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself and come down from the cross in the same way the chief priests along with the scribes were also mocking him among themselves and saying he saved others he cannot save himself,1
1520,MRK,13,NRSV,this is but the beginning of the birth pangs,all the churches of christ greet you,1
1521,MRK,13,NRSV,as for yourselves beware for they will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,1
1522,MRK,13,NRSV,and the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations,his divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness,1
1523,MRK,13,NRSV,when they bring you to trial and hand you over do not worry beforehand about what you are to say but say whatever is given you at that time for it is not you who speak but the holy spirit,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law,1
1524,MRK,13,NRSV,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name,then he gave him the covenant of circumcision,1
1525,MRK,13,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved,fool what you sow does not come to life unless it dies,1
1526,MRK,13,NRSV,but when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat,then jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last,1
1527,MRK,13,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days pray that it may not be in winter,for you do not go in yourselves and when others are going in you stop them,1
1528,MRK,13,NRSV,for in those days there will be suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that god created until now no and never will be,but they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his business while the rest seized his slaves mistreated them and killed them,1
1529,MRK,13,NRSV,and if the lord had not cut short those days no one would be saved but for the sake of the elect whom he chose he has cut short those days,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father,1
1530,MRK,13,NRSV,and if anyone says to you at that time look here is the messiah or look there he isdo not believe it,do we not have the right to our food and drink,1
1531,MRK,13,NRSV,false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to lead astray if possible the elect,who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field come here at once and take your place at the table,1
1532,MRK,13,NRSV,but be alert i have already told you everything,so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace,1
1533,MRK,13,NRSV,but in those days after that suffering the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in the heavens will be shaken,some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him,1
1534,MRK,13,NRSV,then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory,in any case it was kind of you to share my distress,1
1535,MRK,13,NRSV,then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill,1
1536,MRK,13,NRSV,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives,1
1537,MRK,13,NRSV,so also when you see these things taking place you know that he is near at the very gates,but strive for the greater gifts,1
1538,MRK,13,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning,1
1539,MRK,13,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,the law and the prophets were in effect until john came since then the good news of the kingdom of god is proclaimed and everyone tries to enter it by force,1
1540,MRK,13,NRSV,but about that day or hour no one knows neither the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit,1
1541,MRK,13,NRSV,beware keep alert for you do not know when the time will come,go therefore into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet,1
1542,MRK,13,NRSV,it is like a man going on a journey when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge each with his work and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch,for the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith,1
1543,MRK,13,NRSV,therefore keep awakefor you do not know when the master of the house will come in the evening or at midnight or at cockcrow or at dawn or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly,love has been perfected among us in this that we may have boldness on the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world,1
1544,MRK,13,NRSV,and what i say to you i say to all keep awake,so they answered jesus we do not know,1
1545,MRK,14,NRSV,it was two days before the passover and the festival of unleavened bread,when they saw this they made known what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,1
1546,MRK,14,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him for they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,1
1547,MRK,14,NRSV,while he was at bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at the table a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard and she broke open the jar and poured the ointment on his head,or is god the god of jews only,1
1548,MRK,14,NRSV,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way,and when the seven thunders had sounded i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down,1
1549,MRK,14,NRSV,for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor,in returni speak as to childrenopen wide your hearts also,1
1550,MRK,14,NRSV,but jesus said let her alone why do you trouble her,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him,1
1551,MRK,14,NRSV,she has performed a good service for me,jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever,1
1552,MRK,14,NRSV,for you always have the poor with you and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish but you will not always have me,parthians medes elamites and residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya belonging to cyrene and visitors from rome both jews and proselytes cretans and arabsin our own languages we hear them speaking about gods deeds of power,1
1553,MRK,14,NRSV,she has done what she could she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus,1
1554,MRK,14,NRSV,truly i tell you wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her,this was during the festival of unleavened bread when he had seized him he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him intending to bring him out to the people after the passover,1
1555,MRK,14,NRSV,then judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them,the law and the prophets were in effect until john came since then the good news of the kingdom of god is proclaimed and everyone tries to enter it by force,1
1556,MRK,14,NRSV,when they heard it they were greatly pleased and promised to give him money,epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus greets you,1
1557,MRK,14,NRSV,so he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,beloved you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends even though they are strangers to you they have testified to your love before the church,1
1558,MRK,14,NRSV,on the first day of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is sacrificed his disciples said to him where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the passover,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death,1
1559,MRK,14,NRSV,so he sent two of his disciples saying to them go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him and wherever he enters say to the owner of the house the teacher asks where is my guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples,when jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him zacchaeus hurry and come down for i must stay at your house today,1
1560,MRK,14,NRSV,he will show you a large room upstairs furnished and ready,peter said lord are you telling this parable for us or for everyone,1
1561,MRK,14,NRSV,so the disciples set out and went to the city and found everything as he had told them and they prepared the passover meal,the hired hand who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs awayand the wolf snatches them and scatters them,1
1562,MRK,14,NRSV,when it was evening he came with the twelve,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them,1
1563,MRK,14,NRSV,and when they had taken their places and were eating jesus said truly i tell you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves,1
1564,MRK,14,NRSV,they began to be distressed and to say to him one after another surely not i,or what woman having ten silver coins if she loses one of them does not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it,1
1565,MRK,14,NRSV,he said to them it is one of the twelve one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me,i guarded them and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost so that the scripture might be fulfilled,1
1566,MRK,14,NRSV,for the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets,1
1567,MRK,14,NRSV,while they were eating he took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to them and said take this is my body,where do you get that living water,1
1568,MRK,14,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them and all of them drank from it,i persecuted this way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me,1
1569,MRK,14,NRSV,he said to them this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many,and all who sat in the council looked intently at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel,1
1570,MRK,14,NRSV,truly i tell you i will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god,share in suffering like a good soldier of christ jesus,1
1571,MRK,14,NRSV,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives,no one has ever seen god if we love one another god lives in us and his love is perfected in us,1
1572,MRK,14,NRSV,and jesus said to them you will all become deserters for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered,but jesus answered you do not know what you are asking,1
1573,MRK,14,NRSV,but after i am raised up i will go before you to galilee,when he had spent everything a severe famine took place throughout that country and he began to be in need,1
1574,MRK,14,NRSV,peter said to him even though all become deserters i will not,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things,1
1575,MRK,14,NRSV,jesus said to him truly i tell you this day this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times,meanwhile when the crowd gathered by the thousands so that they trampled on one another he began to speak first to his disciples beware of the yeast of the pharisees that is their hypocrisy,1
1576,MRK,14,NRSV,but he said vehemently even though i must die with you i will not deny you,and the world and its desire are passing away but those who do the will of god live forever,1
1577,MRK,14,NRSV,and all of them said the same,some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk desiring to be teachers of the law without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions,1
1578,MRK,14,NRSV,they went to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i pray,the pharisees and sadducees came and to test jesus they asked him to show them a sign from heaven,1
1579,MRK,14,NRSV,he took with him peter and james and john and began to be distressed and agitated,here is a call for the endurance of the saints those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of jesus,1
1580,MRK,14,NRSV,and he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and keep awake,greet those who love us in the faith,1
1581,MRK,14,NRSV,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him,for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly provided for you,1
1582,MRK,14,NRSV,he said abba father for you all things are possible remove this cup from me yet not what i want but what you want,when some of the bystanders heard it they said listen he is calling for elijah,1
1583,MRK,14,NRSV,he came and found them sleeping and he said to peter simon are you asleep,by faith noah warned by god about events as yet unseen respected the warning and built an ark to save his household by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith,1
1584,MRK,14,NRSV,could you not keep awake one hour,join these men go through the rite of purification with them and pay for the shaving of their heads,1
1585,MRK,14,NRSV,keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,and they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere while the lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it,1
1586,MRK,14,NRSV,and again he went away and prayed saying the same words,there he became the father of two sons,1
1587,MRK,14,NRSV,and once more he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they did not know what to say to him,when they had washed her they laid her in a room upstairs,1
1588,MRK,14,NRSV,he came a third time and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest,so he sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus to macedonia while he himself stayed for some time longer in asia,1
1589,MRK,14,NRSV,enough the hour has come the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each,1
1590,MRK,14,NRSV,get up let us be going,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb,1
1591,MRK,14,NRSV,see my betrayer is at hand,later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen,1
1592,MRK,14,NRSV,immediately while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders,then peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijah,1
1593,MRK,14,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him and lead him away under guard,after there had been much debate peter stood up and said to them my brothers you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that i should be the one through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers,1
1594,MRK,14,NRSV,so when he came he went up to him at once and said rabbi and kissed him,for by the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has assigned,1
1595,MRK,14,NRSV,then they laid hands on him and arrested him,he took them with him and withdrew privately to a city called bethsaida,1
1596,MRK,14,NRSV,but one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear,and they were all together in solomons portico,1
1597,MRK,14,NRSV,then jesus said to them have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though i were a bandit,james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes in the dispersion greetings,1
1598,MRK,14,NRSV,day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,1
1599,MRK,14,NRSV,but let the scriptures be fulfilled,this is evidence of the righteous judgment of god and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are also suffering,1
1600,MRK,14,NRSV,all of them deserted him and fled,husband for all you know you might save your wife,1
1601,MRK,14,NRSV,a certain young man was following him wearing nothing but a linen cloth,they were on the road going up to jerusalem and jesus was walking ahead of them they were amazed and those who followed were afraid,1
1602,MRK,14,NRSV,they caught hold of him but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked,when they reached capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to peter and said does your teacher not pay the temple tax,1
1603,MRK,14,NRSV,they took jesus to the high priest and all the chief priests the elders and the scribes were assembled,his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation,1
1604,MRK,14,NRSV,peter had followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting with the guards warming himself at the fire,at that point paul left them,1
1605,MRK,14,NRSV,now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against jesus to put him to death but they found none,i do not want to seem as though i am trying to frighten you with my letters,1
1606,MRK,14,NRSV,for many gave false testimony against him and their testimony did not agree,and when an attempt was made by both gentiles and jews with their rulers to mistreat them and to stone them the apostles learned of it and fled to lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and to the surrounding country and there they continued proclaiming the good news,1
1607,MRK,14,NRSV,some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another not made with hands,but jesus aware of their inner thoughts took a little child and put it by his side and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for the least among all of you is the greatest,1
1608,MRK,14,NRSV,but even on this point their testimony did not agree,it was two days before the passover and the festival of unleavened bread,1
1609,MRK,14,NRSV,then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus have you no answer,very truly i tell you anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit,1
1610,MRK,14,NRSV,what is it that they testify against you,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1
1611,MRK,14,NRSV,but he was silent and did not answer,show me your faith apart from your works and i by my works will show you my faith,1
1612,MRK,14,NRSV,again the high priest asked him are you the messiah the son of the blessed one,he came out and went as was his custom to the mount of olives and the disciples followed him,1
1613,MRK,14,NRSV,jesus said i am and you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of the power and coming with the clouds of heaven,jesus left that place and went away to the district of tyre and sidon,1
1614,MRK,14,NRSV,then the high priest tore his clothes and said why do we still need witnesses,so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring worries of its own,1
1615,MRK,14,NRSV,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision,which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute,1
1616,MRK,14,NRSV,all of them condemned him as deserving death,and a man lame from birth was being carried in,1
1617,MRK,14,NRSV,some began to spit on him to blindfold him and to strike him saying to him prophesy the guards also took him over and beat him,i am the living bread that came down from heaven,1
1618,MRK,14,NRSV,while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servantgirls of the high priest came by,but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your alms may be done in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you,1
1619,MRK,14,NRSV,when she saw peter warming himself she stared at him and said you also were with jesus the man from nazareth,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness,1
1620,MRK,14,NRSV,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about,now before faith came we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed,1
1621,MRK,14,NRSV,and he went out into the forecourt,but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb taking the spices that they had prepared,1
1622,MRK,14,NRSV,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them,and immediately they left their nets and followed him,1
1623,MRK,14,NRSV,then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them,1
1624,MRK,14,NRSV,but he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know this man you are talking about,it is right for me to think this way about all of you because you hold me in your heart for all of you share in gods grace with me both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,1
1625,MRK,14,NRSV,at that moment the cock crowed for the second time,why then did you not put my money into the bank,1
1626,MRK,14,NRSV,then peter remembered that jesus had said to him before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times,but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him,1
1627,MRK,14,NRSV,and he broke down and wept,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved,1
1628,MRK,15,NRSV,as soon as it was morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him,1
1629,MRK,15,NRSV,they bound jesus led him away and handed him over to pilate,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,1
1630,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,pilate gave him permission so he came and removed his body,1
1631,MRK,15,NRSV,he answered him you say so,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down,1
1632,MRK,15,NRSV,then the chief priests accused him of many things,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute,1
1633,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked him again have you no answer,now the men who were holding jesus began to mock him and beat him they also blindfolded him and kept asking him prophesy who is it that struck you,1
1634,MRK,15,NRSV,see how many charges they bring against you,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants,1
1635,MRK,15,NRSV,but jesus made no further reply so that pilate was amazed,now it was mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the other women with them who told this to the apostles,1
1636,MRK,15,NRSV,now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them anyone for whom they asked,he took with him peter and james and john and began to be distressed and agitated,1
1637,MRK,15,NRSV,now a man called barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection,what do you mean by saying you will be made free,1
1638,MRK,15,NRSV,so the crowd came and began to ask pilate to do for them according to his custom,even now you are still not ready for you are still of the flesh,1
1639,MRK,15,NRSV,then he answered them do you want me to release for you the king of the jews,and others are those sown among the thorns these are the ones who hear the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word and it yields nothing,1
1640,MRK,15,NRSV,for he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over,after the people of that place recognized him they sent word throughout the region and brought all who were sick to him and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed,1
1641,MRK,15,NRSV,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead,for christ also suffered for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous in order to bring you to god,1
1642,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate spoke to them again then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the king of the jews,so then my brothers and sisters when you come together to eat wait for one another,1
1643,MRK,15,NRSV,they shouted back crucify him pilate asked them why what evil has he done,nicodemus who had at first come to jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds,1
1644,MRK,15,NRSV,but they shouted all the more crucify him so pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified,but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your alms may be done in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you,1
1645,MRK,15,NRSV,then the soldiers led him into the courtyard of the palace that is the governors headquarters and they called together the whole cohort,he is god not of the dead but of the living you are quite wrong,1
1646,MRK,15,NRSV,and they clothed him in a purple cloak and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on him,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone,1
1647,MRK,15,NRSV,and they began saluting him hail king of the jews they struck his head with a reed spat upon him and knelt down in homage to him,and they took offense at him,1
1648,MRK,15,NRSV,after mocking him they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water,1
1649,MRK,15,NRSV,then they led him out to crucify him,after the uproar had ceased paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them and saying farewell he left for macedonia,1
1650,MRK,15,NRSV,they compelled a passerby who was coming in from the country to carry his cross it was simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus,first of all you must understand this that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and indulging their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming,1
1651,MRK,15,NRSV,then they brought jesus to the place called golgotha which means the place of a skull,i appeal to you brothers and sisters by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit to join me in earnest prayer to god on my behalf that i may be rescued from the unbelievers in judea and that my ministry to jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints so that by gods will i may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company,1
1652,MRK,15,NRSV,and they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it,the swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country,1
1653,MRK,15,NRSV,and they crucified him and divided his clothes among them casting lots to decide what each should take,in the world you face persecution,1
1654,MRK,15,NRSV,it was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him,no testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone,1
1655,MRK,15,NRSV,the inscription of the charge against him read the king of the jews,if you have ordinary cases then do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church,1
1656,MRK,15,NRSV,and with him they crucified two bandits one on his right and one on his left,so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief,1
1657,MRK,15,NRSV,those who passed by derided him shaking their heads and saying aha you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself and come down from the cross in the same way the chief priests along with the scribes were also mocking him among themselves and saying he saved others he cannot save himself,but we have the mind of christ,1
1658,MRK,15,NRSV,let the messiah the king of israel come down from the cross now so that we may see and believe,then he said to them do you not yet understand,1
1659,MRK,15,NRSV,those who were crucified with him also taunted him,they kept coming up to him saying hail king of the jews and striking him on the face,1
1660,MRK,15,NRSV,when it was noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1
1661,MRK,15,NRSV,at three oclock jesus cried out with a loud voice eloi eloi lema sabachthani,but gallio paid no attention to any of these things,1
1662,MRK,15,NRSV,which means my god my god why have you forsaken me,in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent by god to a town in galilee called nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david,1
1663,MRK,15,NRSV,when some of the bystanders heard it they said listen he is calling for elijah,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he says also in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,1
1664,MRK,15,NRSV,and someone ran filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink saying wait let us see whether elijah will come to take him down,everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor,1
1665,MRK,15,NRSV,then jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son,1
1666,MRK,15,NRSV,and the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy,1
1667,MRK,15,NRSV,now when the centurion who stood facing him saw that in this way he breathed his last he said truly this man was gods son there were also women looking on from a distance among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the younger and of joses and salome,where is the debater of this age,1
1668,MRK,15,NRSV,these used to follow him and provided for him when he was in galilee and there were many other women who had come up with him to jerusalem,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit,1
1669,MRK,15,NRSV,when evening had come and since it was the day of preparation that is the day before the sabbath joseph of arimathea a respected member of the council who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god went boldly to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,but now that you say we see your sin remains,1
1670,MRK,15,NRSV,then pilate wondered if he were already dead and summoning the centurion he asked him whether he had been dead for some time,can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another but a believer goes to court against a believer and before unbelievers at that,1
1671,MRK,15,NRSV,when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the body to joseph,while i was doing this they found me in the temple completing the rite of purification without any crowd or disturbance,1
1672,MRK,15,NRSV,then joseph bought a linen cloth and taking down the body wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,1
1673,MRK,15,NRSV,he then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name,1
1674,MRK,15,NRSV,mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw where the body was laid,when the two days were over he went from that place to galilee for jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophets own country,1
1675,MRK,16,NRSV,when the sabbath was over mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor,1
1676,MRK,16,NRSV,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,1
1677,MRK,16,NRSV,they had been saying to one another who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb,can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another but a believer goes to court against a believer and before unbelievers at that,1
1678,MRK,16,NRSV,when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled back,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he says also in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,1
1679,MRK,16,NRSV,as they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed,how can you say show us the father,1
1680,MRK,16,NRSV,but he said to them do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified,now we command you beloved in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us,1
1681,MRK,16,NRSV,he has been raised he is not here,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first,1
1682,MRK,16,NRSV,look there is the place they laid him,did we not take the same steps,1
1683,MRK,16,NRSV,but go tell his disciples and peter that he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him just as he told you,immediately they regained their sight and followed him,1
1684,MRK,16,NRSV,so they went out and fled from the tomb for terror and amazement had seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,1
1685,MRK,16,NRSV,and all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around peter,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ,1
1686,MRK,16,NRSV,and afterward jesus himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation,after mocking him they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him,1
1687,MRK,16,NRSV,now after he rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons,and he said to me these are true words of god,1
1688,MRK,16,NRSV,she went out and told those who had been with him while they were mourning and weeping,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire,1
1689,MRK,16,NRSV,but when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they would not believe it,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy,1
1690,MRK,16,NRSV,after this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country,then he said to the disciple here is your mother,1
1691,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision,1
1692,MRK,16,NRSV,later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove,1
1693,MRK,16,NRSV,and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation,other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty,1
1694,MRK,16,NRSV,the one who believes and is baptized will be saved but the one who does not believe will be condemned,when peter said from others jesus said to him then the children are free,1
1695,MRK,16,NRSV,and these signs will accompany those who believe by using my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes in their hands and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,1
1696,MRK,16,NRSV,so then the lord jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans,1
1697,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere while the lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,1
1698,LUK,1,NRSV,since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word i too decided after investigating everything carefully from the very first to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed,for it was attested before he was taken away that he had pleased god,1
1699,LUK,1,NRSV,in the days of king herod of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of abijah,then all the disciples deserted him and fled,1
1700,LUK,1,NRSV,his wife was a descendant of aaron and her name was elizabeth,children obey your parents in everything for this is your acceptable duty in the lord,1
1701,LUK,1,NRSV,both of them were righteous before god living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the lord,so the soldiers according to their instructions took paul and brought him during the night to antipatris,1
1702,LUK,1,NRSV,but they had no children because elizabeth was barren and both were getting on in years,they compelled a passerby who was coming in from the country to carry his cross it was simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus,1
1703,LUK,1,NRSV,once when he was serving as priest before god and his section was on duty he was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to enter the sanctuary of the lord and offer incense,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way,1
1704,LUK,1,NRSV,now at the time of the incense offering the whole assembly of the people was praying outside,from that time on jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,1
1705,LUK,1,NRSV,then there appeared to him an angel of the lord standing at the right side of the altar of incense,as it is there are many members yet one body,1
1706,LUK,1,NRSV,when zechariah saw him he was terrified and fear overwhelmed him,be hospitable to one another without complaining,1
1707,LUK,1,NRSV,but the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariah for your prayer has been heard,he said to them i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i tell you i will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god,1
1708,LUK,1,NRSV,your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you will name him john,much more surely then now that we have been justified by his blood will we be saved through him from the wrath of god,1
1709,LUK,1,NRSV,you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth for he will be great in the sight of the lord,now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to make you stand without blemish in the presence of his glory with rejoicing to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord be glory majesty power and authority before all time and now and forever,1
1710,LUK,1,NRSV,he must never drink wine or strong drink even before his birth he will be filled with the holy spirit,come now i will send you to egypt,1
1711,LUK,1,NRSV,he will turn many of the people of israel to the lord their god,also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them,1
1712,LUK,1,NRSV,with the spirit and power of elijah he will go before him to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the lord,but others said it is elijah,1
1713,LUK,1,NRSV,zechariah said to the angel how will i know that this is so,jesus said to them watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees,1
1714,LUK,1,NRSV,for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years,when they came to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him and said lord have mercy on my son for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly he often falls into the fire and often into the water,1
1715,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel replied i am gabriel,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,1
1716,LUK,1,NRSV,i stand in the presence of god and i have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat,1
1717,LUK,1,NRSV,but now because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time you will become mute unable to speak until the day these things occur,they will receive the greater condemnation,1
1718,LUK,1,NRSV,meanwhile the people were waiting for zechariah and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary,i permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man she is to keep silent,1
1719,LUK,1,NRSV,when he did come out he could not speak to them and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,1
1720,LUK,1,NRSV,he kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak,then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called cyrenians alexandrians and others of those from cilicia and asia stood up and argued with stephen,1
1721,LUK,1,NRSV,when his time of service was ended he went to his home,but filled with the holy spirit he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god,1
1722,LUK,1,NRSV,after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and for five months she remained in seclusion,but he said vehemently even though i must die with you i will not deny you,1
1723,LUK,1,NRSV,she said this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life,1
1724,LUK,1,NRSV,in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent by god to a town in galilee called nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask,1
1725,LUK,1,NRSV,and he came to her and said greetings favored one the lord is with you,the slaves said to him then do you want us to go and gather them,1
1726,LUK,1,NRSV,but she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be,so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for this bountiful gift that you have promised so that it may be ready as a voluntary gift and not as an extortion,1
1727,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel said to her do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god,do your best to come to me soon for demas in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia titus to dalmatia,1
1728,LUK,1,NRSV,and now you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will name him jesus,a scribe then approached and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go,1
1729,LUK,1,NRSV,he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his ancestor david,and because of the increase of lawlessness the love of many will grow cold,1
1730,LUK,1,NRSV,he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction,1
1731,LUK,1,NRSV,mary said to the angel how can this be since i am a virgin,at the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steeringoars then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach,1
1732,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel said to her the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be holy he will be called son of god,his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow,1
1733,LUK,1,NRSV,and now your relative elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren,when they heard this they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching,1
1734,LUK,1,NRSV,for nothing will be impossible with god,the high priest questioned them saying we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name yet here you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this mans blood on us,1
1735,LUK,1,NRSV,then mary said here am i the servant of the lord let it be with me according to your word,but when the disciples saw it they were angry and said why this waste,1
1736,LUK,1,NRSV,then the angel departed from her,pilate asked him what is truth,1
1737,LUK,1,NRSV,in those days mary set out and went with haste to a judean town in the hill country where she entered the house of zechariah and greeted elizabeth,she said this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people,1
1738,LUK,1,NRSV,when elizabeth heard marys greeting the child leaped in her womb,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints,1
1739,LUK,1,NRSV,and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb,and the people stood by watching but the leaders scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the messiah of god his chosen one the soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself there was also an inscription over him this is the king of the jews,1
1740,LUK,1,NRSV,and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me,brothers and sisters my hearts desire and prayer to god for them is that they may be saved,1
1741,LUK,1,NRSV,for as soon as i heard the sound of your greeting the child in my womb leaped for joy,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him,1
1742,LUK,1,NRSV,and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the lord,now it was the day of preparation for the passover and it was about noon,1
1743,LUK,1,NRSV,and mary said my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant,and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home,1
1744,LUK,1,NRSV,surely from now on all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me and holy is his name,when he comes he will proclaim all things to us,1
1745,LUK,1,NRSV,his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation,then jesus stretched out his hand touched him and said i do choose,1
1746,LUK,1,NRSV,he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts,so they seized him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,1
1747,LUK,1,NRSV,he has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty,then jesus ordered them to tell no one but the more he ordered them the more zealously they proclaimed it,1
1748,LUK,1,NRSV,he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy according to the promise he made to our ancestors to abraham and to his descendants forever,for in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him god was pleased to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven by making peace through the blood of his cross,1
1749,LUK,1,NRSV,and mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,1
1750,LUK,1,NRSV,now the time came for elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son,i adjure you by god do not torment me,1
1751,LUK,1,NRSV,her neighbors and relatives heard that the lord had shown his great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk,1
1752,LUK,1,NRSV,on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him zechariah after his father,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor,1
1753,LUK,1,NRSV,but his mother said no he is to be called john,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,1
1754,LUK,1,NRSV,they said to her none of your relatives has this name,but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding robe,1
1755,LUK,1,NRSV,then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him,he removes every branch in me that bears no fruit,1
1756,LUK,1,NRSV,he asked for a writing tablet and wrote his name is john,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption,1
1757,LUK,1,NRSV,and all of them were amazed,it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade,1
1758,LUK,1,NRSV,immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed and he began to speak praising god,it is my eager expectation and hope that i will not be put to shame in any way but that by my speaking with all boldness christ will be exalted now as always in my body whether by life or by death,1
1759,LUK,1,NRSV,fear came over all their neighbors and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of judea,and he stood up and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them so that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we have never seen anything like this jesus went out again beside the sea the whole crowd gathered around him and he taught them,1
1760,LUK,1,NRSV,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become,again he sent other slaves saying tell those who have been invited look i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet,1
1761,LUK,1,NRSV,for indeed the hand of the lord was with him,jesus answered do you ask this on your own or did others tell you about me,1
1762,LUK,1,NRSV,then his father zechariah was filled with the holy spirit and spoke this prophecy blessed be the lord god of israel for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,1
1763,LUK,1,NRSV,he has raised up a mighty savior for us in the house of his servant david as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,a great number of the people followed him and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him,1
1764,LUK,1,NRSV,thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors and has remembered his holy covenant the oath that he swore to our ancestor abraham to grant us that we being rescued from the hands of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days,therefore the law was our disciplinarian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith,1
1765,LUK,1,NRSV,and you child will be called the prophet of the most high for you will go before the lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins,then jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and he looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly,1
1766,LUK,1,NRSV,by the tender mercy of our god the dawn from on high will break upon us to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace,in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots,1
1767,LUK,1,NRSV,the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to israel,when he entered the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said by what authority are you doing these things and who gave you this authority,1
1768,LUK,2,NRSV,in those days a decree went out from emperor augustus that all the world should be registered,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints,1
1769,LUK,2,NRSV,this was the first registration and was taken while quirinius was governor of syria,he replied elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things but i tell you that elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but they did to him whatever they pleased,1
1770,LUK,2,NRSV,all went to their own towns to be registered,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father,1
1771,LUK,2,NRSV,joseph also went from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to the city of david called bethlehem because he was descended from the house and family of david,mary has chosen the better part which will not be taken away from her,1
1772,LUK,2,NRSV,he went to be registered with mary to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,1
1773,LUK,2,NRSV,while they were there the time came for her to deliver her child,then peter came and said to him lord if another member of the church sins against me how often should i forgive,1
1774,LUK,2,NRSV,and she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1
1775,LUK,2,NRSV,in that region there were shepherds living in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night,our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen,1
1776,LUK,2,NRSV,then an angel of the lord stood before them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were terrified,jesus said to him again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test,1
1777,LUK,2,NRSV,but the angel said to them do not be afraid for seei am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people to you is born this day in the city of david a savior who is the messiah the lord,he entered his headquarters again and asked jesus where are you from,1
1778,LUK,2,NRSV,this will be a sign for you you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger,but even on this point their testimony did not agree,1
1779,LUK,2,NRSV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest heaven and on earth peace among those whom he favors when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another let us go now to bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place which the lord has made known to us,she will bear a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins,1
1780,LUK,2,NRSV,so they went with haste and found mary and joseph and the child lying in the manger,only let us hold fast to what we have attained,1
1781,LUK,2,NRSV,when they saw this they made known what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler and saul,1
1782,LUK,2,NRSV,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand,1
1783,LUK,2,NRSV,the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all they had heard and seen as it had been told them,the pharisees then said to one another you see you can do nothing,1
1784,LUK,2,NRSV,after eight days had passed it was time to circumcise the child and he was called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb,still i think it necessary to send to you epaphroditusmy brother and coworker and fellow soldier your messenger and minister to my need for he has been longing for all of you and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill,1
1785,LUK,2,NRSV,when the time came for their purification according to the law of moses they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the lord and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,now if i am in the wrong and have committed something for which i deserve to die i am not trying to escape death but if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can turn me over to them,1
1786,LUK,2,NRSV,now there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon this man was righteous and devout looking forward to the consolation of israel and the holy spirit rested on him,because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous,1
1787,LUK,2,NRSV,it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the lords messiah,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish just as they did,1
1788,LUK,2,NRSV,guided by the spirit simeon came into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what was customary under the law simeon took him in his arms and praised god saying master now you are dismissing your servant in peace according to your word for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people israel,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments,1
1789,LUK,2,NRSV,and the childs father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money,1
1790,LUK,2,NRSV,then simeon blessed them and said to his mother mary this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealedand a sword will pierce your own soul too,he ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics,1
1791,LUK,2,NRSV,there was also a prophet anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher,then i looked and i heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands singing with full voice worthy is the lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them singing to the one seated on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped,1
1792,LUK,2,NRSV,she was of a great age having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage then as a widow to the age of eightyfour,for this reason i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name,1
1793,LUK,2,NRSV,she never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them,1
1794,LUK,2,NRSV,at that moment she came and began to praise god and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of jerusalem,those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found both good and bad so the wedding hall was filled with guests,1
1795,LUK,2,NRSV,when they had finished everything required by the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,1
1796,LUK,2,NRSV,the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom and the favor of god was upon him,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,1
1797,LUK,2,NRSV,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name,1
1798,LUK,2,NRSV,and when he was twelve years old they went up as usual for the festival,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man,1
1799,LUK,2,NRSV,when the festival was ended and they started to return the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but his parents did not know it,after one day there a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to puteoli,1
1800,LUK,2,NRSV,assuming that he was in the group of travelers they went a days journey,but if you are led by the spirit you are not subject to the law,1
1801,LUK,2,NRSV,then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1
1802,LUK,2,NRSV,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him,go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice,1
1803,LUK,2,NRSV,after three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory,1
1804,LUK,2,NRSV,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter,1
1805,LUK,2,NRSV,when his parents saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him child why have you treated us like this,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1
1806,LUK,2,NRSV,look your father and i have been searching for you in great anxiety,now when the first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received the usual daily wage,1
1807,LUK,2,NRSV,he said to them why were you searching for me,and he answered them go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news brought to them,1
1808,LUK,2,NRSV,did you not know that i must be in my fathers house,and every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim jesus as the messiah,1
1809,LUK,2,NRSV,but they did not understand what he said to them,there are three that testify the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree,1
1810,LUK,2,NRSV,then he went down with them and came to nazareth and was obedient to them,you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour,1
1811,LUK,2,NRSV,his mother treasured all these things in her heart,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,1
1812,LUK,2,NRSV,and jesus increased in wisdom and in years and in divine and human favor,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,1
1813,LUK,3,NRSV,in the fifteenth year of the reign of emperor tiberius when pontius pilate was governor of judea and herod was ruler of galilee and his brother philip ruler of the region of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias ruler of abilene during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came to john son of zechariah in the wilderness,then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising god with a loud voice,1
1814,LUK,3,NRSV,he went into all the region around the jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet isaiah the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to them god will add to that person the plagues described in this book if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy god will take away that persons share in the tree of life and in the holy city which are described in this book,1
1815,LUK,3,NRSV,every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight,1
1816,LUK,3,NRSV,john said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,by running under the lee of a small island called cauda we were scarcely able to get the ships boat under control,1
1817,LUK,3,NRSV,do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan,1
1818,LUK,3,NRSV,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,and the fifth angel blew his trumpet and i saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft,1
1819,LUK,3,NRSV,and the crowds asked him what then should we do,now get up go down and go with them without hesitation for i have sent them,1
1820,LUK,3,NRSV,in reply he said to them whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none and whoever has food must do likewise,he ate nothing at all during those days and when they were over he was famished,1
1821,LUK,3,NRSV,even tax collectors came to be baptized and they asked him teacher what should we do,we have renounced the shameful things that one hides we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify gods word but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of god,1
1822,LUK,3,NRSV,he said to them collect no more than the amount prescribed for you,now the festival of unleavened bread which is called the passover was near,1
1823,LUK,3,NRSV,soldiers also asked him and we what should we do,no one will snatch them out of my hand,1
1824,LUK,3,NRSV,he said to them do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation and be satisfied with your wages,and great fear seized all who heard of it,1
1825,LUK,3,NRSV,as the people were filled with expectation and all were questioning in their hearts concerning john whether he might be the messiah john answered all of them by saying i baptize you with water but one who is more powerful than i is coming i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals,what then are we to say,1
1826,LUK,3,NRSV,he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire,i saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun having the seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea saying do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have marked the servants of our god with a seal on their foreheads,1
1827,LUK,3,NRSV,his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the passover,1
1828,LUK,3,NRSV,so with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people,beloved while eagerly preparing to write to you about the salvation we share i find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints,1
1829,LUK,3,NRSV,but herod the ruler who had been rebuked by him because of herodias his brothers wife and because of all the evil things that herod had done added to them all by shutting up john in prison,whoever has the son has life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life,1
1830,LUK,3,NRSV,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove,others have labored and you have entered into their labor,1
1831,LUK,3,NRSV,and a voice came from heaven you are my son the beloved with you i am well pleased,i appeal to you brothers and sisters bear with my word of exhortation for i have written to you briefly,1
1832,LUK,3,NRSV,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,therefore he has also said in another psalm you will not let your holy one experience corruption,1
1833,LUK,3,NRSV,he was the son as was thought of joseph son of heli son of matthat son of levi son of melchi son of jannai son of joseph son of mattathias son of amos son of nahum son of esli son of naggai son of maath son of mattathias son of semein son of josech son of joda son of joanan son of rhesa son of zerubbabel son of shealtiel son of neri son of melchi son of addi son of cosam son of elmadam son of er son of joshua son of eliezer son of jorim son of matthat son of levi son of simeon son of judah son of joseph son of jonam son of eliakim son of melea son of menna son of mattatha son of nathan son of david son of jesse son of obed son of boaz son of sala son of nahshon son of amminadab son of admin son of arni son of hezron son of perez son of judah son of jacob son of isaac son of abraham son of terah son of nahor son of serug son of reu son of peleg son of eber son of shelah son of cainan son of arphaxad son of shem son of noah son of lamech son of methuselah son of enoch son of jared son of mahalaleel son of cainan son of enos son of seth son of adam son of god,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father,1
1834,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness where for forty days he was tempted by the devil,and if the ear would say because i am not an eye i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body,1
1835,LUK,4,NRSV,he ate nothing at all during those days and when they were over he was famished,and again another passage of scripture says they will look on the one whom they have pierced,1
1836,LUK,4,NRSV,the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become a loaf of bread,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory,1
1837,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written one does not live by bread alone,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury,1
1838,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world,get up let us be going,1
1839,LUK,4,NRSV,and the devil said to him to you i will give their glory and all this authority for it has been given over to me and i give it to anyone i please,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband,1
1840,LUK,4,NRSV,if you then will worship me it will all be yours,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts,1
1841,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,do you not remember that i told you these things when i was still with you,1
1842,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil took him to jerusalem and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down from here for it is written he will command his angels concerning you to protect you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone,the elder to the beloved gaius whom i love in truth,1
1843,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is said do not put the lord your god to the test,no one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs the soldiers aim is to please the enlisting officer,1
1844,LUK,4,NRSV,when the devil had finished every test he departed from him until an opportune time,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation,1
1845,LUK,4,NRSV,then jesus filled with the power of the spirit returned to galilee and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country,and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear,1
1846,LUK,4,NRSV,he began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,1
1847,LUK,4,NRSV,when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day as was his custom,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,1
1848,LUK,4,NRSV,he stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him,such a person receives praise not from others but from god,1
1849,LUK,4,NRSV,he unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,1
1850,LUK,4,NRSV,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the lords favor,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1
1851,LUK,4,NRSV,and he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down,for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly provided for you,1
1852,LUK,4,NRSV,the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,1
1853,LUK,4,NRSV,then he began to say to them today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet,1
1854,LUK,4,NRSV,all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour,1
1855,LUK,4,NRSV,they said is not this josephs son,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,1
1856,LUK,4,NRSV,he said to them doubtless you will quote to me this proverb doctor cure yourself and you will say do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at capernaum,and to the angel of the church in thyatira write these are the words of the son of god who has eyes like a flame of fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze i know your worksyour love faith service and patient endurance,1
1857,LUK,4,NRSV,and he said truly i tell you no prophet is accepted in the prophets hometown,as for yourselves beware for they will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them,1
1858,LUK,4,NRSV,but the truth is there were many widows in israel in the time of elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months and there was a severe famine over all the land yet elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at zarephath in sidon,he will show you a large room upstairs already furnished,1
1859,LUK,4,NRSV,there were also many lepers in israel in the time of the prophet elisha and none of them was cleansed except naaman the syrian,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,1
1860,LUK,4,NRSV,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything,1
1861,LUK,4,NRSV,they got up drove him out of the town and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff,for the son of man is lord of the sabbath,1
1862,LUK,4,NRSV,but he passed through the midst of them and went on his way,how then does he now see,1
1863,LUK,4,NRSV,he went down to capernaum a city in galilee and was teaching them on the sabbath,so do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows,1
1864,LUK,4,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching because he spoke with authority,give to everyone who begs from you and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you,1
1865,LUK,4,NRSV,in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice let us alone what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed,1
1866,LUK,4,NRSV,have you come to destroy us,it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile they throw it away,1
1867,LUK,4,NRSV,i know who you are the holy one of god,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband is the head of his wife and god is the head of christ,1
1868,LUK,4,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead,1
1869,LUK,4,NRSV,they were all amazed and kept saying to one another what kind of utterance is this,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like,1
1870,LUK,4,NRSV,for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and out they come and a report about him began to reach every place in the region,blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god,1
1871,LUK,4,NRSV,after leaving the synagogue he entered simons house,i write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you,1
1872,LUK,4,NRSV,now simons motherinlaw was suffering from a high fever and they asked him about her,pay to all what is due themtaxes to whom taxes are due revenue to whom revenue is due respect to whom respect is due honor to whom honor is due,1
1873,LUK,4,NRSV,then he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her,but god raised him up having freed him from death because it was impossible for him to be held in its power,1
1874,LUK,4,NRSV,immediately she got up and began to serve them,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight,1
1875,LUK,4,NRSV,as the sun was setting all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them,and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine and the herd numbering about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea,1
1876,LUK,4,NRSV,demons also came out of many shouting you are the son of god but he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the messiah,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,1
1877,LUK,4,NRSV,at daybreak he departed and went into a deserted place,but i say to you that listen love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you,1
1878,LUK,4,NRSV,and the crowds were looking for him and when they reached him they wanted to prevent him from leaving them,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him,1
1879,LUK,4,NRSV,but he said to them i must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of god to the other cities also for i was sent for this purpose,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,1
1880,LUK,4,NRSV,so he continued proclaiming the message in the synagogues of judea,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,1
1881,LUK,5,NRSV,once while jesus was standing beside the lake of gennesaret and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of god he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us,1
1882,LUK,5,NRSV,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore,for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work but only until the one who now restrains it is removed,1
1883,LUK,5,NRSV,then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat,very truly i tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain but if it dies it bears much fruit,1
1884,LUK,5,NRSV,when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch,and so we came to rome,1
1885,LUK,5,NRSV,simon answered master we have worked all night long but have caught nothing,paul wanted timothy to accompany him and he took him and had him circumcised because of the jews who were in those places for they all knew that his father was a greek,1
1886,LUK,5,NRSV,yet if you say so i will let down the nets,then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he had found him he brought him to antioch,1
1887,LUK,5,NRSV,when they had done this they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break,to the pure all things are pure but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure,1
1888,LUK,5,NRSV,so they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them,she was devoted to good works and acts of charity,1
1889,LUK,5,NRSV,and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink,the earth shook and the rocks were split,1
1890,LUK,5,NRSV,but when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying go away from me lord for i am a sinful man for he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken and so also were james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon,we want you to know brothers and sisters about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part,1
1891,LUK,5,NRSV,then jesus said to simon do not be afraid from now on you will be catching people,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,1
1892,LUK,5,NRSV,when they had brought their boats to shore they left everything and followed him,and his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light,1
1893,LUK,5,NRSV,once when he was in one of the cities there was a man covered with leprosy,so there will be one flock one shepherd,1
1894,LUK,5,NRSV,when he saw jesus he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him lord if you choose you can make me clean,he then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away,1
1895,LUK,5,NRSV,then jesus stretched out his hand touched him and said i do choose,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat,1
1896,LUK,5,NRSV,and he ordered him to tell no one,but some of them joined him and became believers including dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them,1
1897,LUK,5,NRSV,go he said and show yourself to the priest and as moses commanded make an offering for your cleansing for a testimony to them,make room in your hearts for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one,1
1898,LUK,5,NRSV,but now more than ever the word about jesus spread abroad many crowds would gather to hear him and to be cured of their diseases,and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,1
1899,LUK,5,NRSV,but he would withdraw to deserted places and pray,he was in the world and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know him,1
1900,LUK,5,NRSV,one day while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting near by they had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal,but you yourselves wrong and defraudand believers at that,1
1901,LUK,5,NRSV,just then some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a bed,he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land and the rest to follow some on planks and others on pieces of the ship,1
1902,LUK,5,NRSV,they were trying to bring him in and lay him before jesus but finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the middle of the crowd in front of jesus,there is no restriction in our affections but only in yours,1
1903,LUK,5,NRSV,when he saw their faith he said friend your sins are forgiven you,the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he cured them,1
1904,LUK,5,NRSV,then the scribes and the pharisees began to question who is this who is speaking blasphemies,look i have set before you an open door which no one is able to shut,1
1905,LUK,5,NRSV,who can forgive sins but god alone,you are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels and yet you have not kept it,1
1906,LUK,5,NRSV,when jesus perceived their questionings he answered them why do you raise such questions in your hearts,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us,1
1907,LUK,5,NRSV,which is easier to say your sins are forgiven you or to say stand up and walk,philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed the messiah to them,1
1908,LUK,5,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the one who was paralyzedi say to you stand up and take your bed and go to your home,have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives tales,1
1909,LUK,5,NRSV,immediately he stood up before them took what he had been lying on and went to his home glorifying god,and this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world,1
1910,LUK,5,NRSV,amazement seized all of them and they glorified god and were filled with awe saying we have seen strange things today,and all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple,1
1911,LUK,5,NRSV,after this he went out and saw a tax collector named levi sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,around the throne and on each side of the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind the first living creature like a lion the second living creature like an ox the third living creature with a face like a human face and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle,1
1912,LUK,5,NRSV,and he got up left everything and followed him,are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it,1
1913,LUK,5,NRSV,then levi gave a great banquet for him in his house and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them,he took him aside in private away from the crowd and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue,1
1914,LUK,5,NRSV,the pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners,i have come as light into the world so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness,1
1915,LUK,5,NRSV,jesus answered those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance,now after they had left an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream and said get up take the child and his mother and flee to egypt and remain there until i tell you for herod is about to search for the child to destroy him,1
1916,LUK,5,NRSV,then they said to him johns disciples like the disciples of the pharisees frequently fast and pray but your disciples eat and drink,tell me so that i may believe in him,1
1917,LUK,5,NRSV,jesus said to them you cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them can you,the word is near you on your lips and in your heart that is the word of faith that we proclaim because if you confess with your lips that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved,1
1918,LUK,5,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast in those days,and in the spirit he carried me away to a great high mountain and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god,1
1919,LUK,5,NRSV,he also told them a parable no one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment otherwise the new will be torn and the piece from the new will not match the old,as they went away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at,1
1920,LUK,5,NRSV,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed,he entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there,1
1921,LUK,5,NRSV,but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins,when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised god and said certainly this man was innocent,1
1922,LUK,5,NRSV,and no one after drinking old wine desires new wine but says the old is good,for it is clear that he did not come to help angels but the descendants of abraham,1
1923,LUK,6,NRSV,one sabbath while jesus was going through the grainfields his disciples plucked some heads of grain rubbed them in their hands and ate them,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,1
1924,LUK,6,NRSV,but some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,be merciful just as your father is merciful,1
1925,LUK,6,NRSV,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,the rest of humankind who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood which cannot see or hear or walk,1
1926,LUK,6,NRSV,he entered the house of god and took and ate the bread of the presence which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and gave some to his companions,as you know we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of god who calls you into his own kingdom and glory,1
1927,LUK,6,NRSV,then he said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath,yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things took place,1
1928,LUK,6,NRSV,on another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught and there was a man there whose right hand was withered,and they laughed at him knowing that she was dead,1
1929,LUK,6,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees watched him to see whether he would cure on the sabbath so that they might find an accusation against him,then they said to him johns disciples like the disciples of the pharisees frequently fast and pray but your disciples eat and drink,1
1930,LUK,6,NRSV,even though he knew what they were thinking he said to the man who had the withered hand come and stand here,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication,1
1931,LUK,6,NRSV,he got up and stood there,for you always have the poor with you and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish but you will not always have me,1
1932,LUK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them i ask you is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to destroy it,jesus answered if i have spoken wrongly testify to the wrong,1
1933,LUK,6,NRSV,after looking around at all of them he said to him stretch out your hand,he said to them have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1
1934,LUK,6,NRSV,he did so and his hand was restored,then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them,1
1935,LUK,6,NRSV,but they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to jesus,let the evildoer still do evil and the filthy still be filthy and the righteous still do right and the holy still be holy,1
1936,LUK,6,NRSV,now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the night in prayer to god,meanwhile standing near the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene,1
1937,LUK,6,NRSV,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor,when they had spoken the word in perga they went down to attalia,1
1938,LUK,6,NRSV,he came down with them and stood on a level place with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all judea jerusalem and the coast of tyre and sidon,she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair,1
1939,LUK,6,NRSV,they had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured,he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus,1
1940,LUK,6,NRSV,and all in the crowd were trying to touch him for power came out from him and healed all of them,we intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering for we intend to do what is right not only in the lords sight but also in the sight of others,1
1941,LUK,6,NRSV,then he looked up at his disciples and said blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god,or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless,1
1942,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who are hungry now for you will be filled,after some days paul said to barnabas come let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the lord and see how they are doing,1
1943,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh,he became hungry and wanted something to eat and while it was being prepared he fell into a trance,1
1944,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you revile you and defame you on account of the son of man,he went through syria and cilicia strengthening the churches,1
1945,LUK,6,NRSV,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets,all must test their own work then that work rather than their neighbors work will become a cause for pride,1
1946,LUK,6,NRSV,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation,to those outside the law i became as one outside the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so that i might win those outside the law,1
1947,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you who are full now for you will be hungry,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace,1
1948,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you who are laughing now for you will mourn and weep,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,1
1949,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you when all speak well of you for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets,i tell you on that night there will be two in one bed one will be taken and the other left,1
1950,LUK,6,NRSV,but i say to you that listen love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you,he unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor,1
1951,LUK,6,NRSV,if anyone strikes you on the cheek offer the other also and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt,was none of them found to return and give praise to god except this foreigner,1
1952,LUK,6,NRSV,give to everyone who begs from you and if anyone takes away your goods do not ask for them again,do not be deceived my beloved,1
1953,LUK,6,NRSV,do to others as you would have them do to you,love does no wrong to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law,1
1954,LUK,6,NRSV,if you love those who love you what credit is that to you,i know who you are the holy one of god,1
1955,LUK,6,NRSV,for even sinners love those who love them,do you not remember that i told you these things when i was still with you,1
1956,LUK,6,NRSV,if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you,this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you,1
1957,LUK,6,NRSV,for even sinners do the same,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour,1
1958,LUK,6,NRSV,if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what credit is that to you,do not fear what you are about to suffer,1
1959,LUK,6,NRSV,even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much again,in fact to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you,1
1960,LUK,6,NRSV,but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return,have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another,1
1961,LUK,6,NRSV,your reward will be great and you will be children of the most high for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked,to the rest i sayi and not the lordthat if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her,1
1962,LUK,6,NRSV,be merciful just as your father is merciful,and she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn,1
1963,LUK,6,NRSV,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,get mark and bring him with you for he is useful in my ministry,1
1964,LUK,6,NRSV,forgive and you will be forgiven give and it will be given to you,perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brotherespecially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the lord,1
1965,LUK,6,NRSV,a good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap for the measure you give will be the measure you get back,they were asking for simons house and were standing by the gate,1
1966,LUK,6,NRSV,he also told them a parable can a blind person guide a blind person,they said to him he will put those wretches to a miserable death and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time,1
1967,LUK,6,NRSV,will not both fall into a pit,look at what is before your eyes,1
1968,LUK,6,NRSV,a disciple is not above the teacher but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher,then he said to his slaves the wedding is ready but those invited were not worthy,1
1969,LUK,6,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye,they answered john the baptist but others elijah and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen,1
1970,LUK,6,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor friend let me take out the speck in your eye when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak otherwise the patch pulls away from it the new from the old and a worse tear is made,1
1971,LUK,6,NRSV,you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors eye,as they left the council they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name,1
1972,LUK,6,NRSV,no good tree bears bad fruit nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit for each tree is known by its own fruit,the father judges no one but has given all judgment to the son so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father,1
1973,LUK,6,NRSV,figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,1
1974,LUK,6,NRSV,the good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks,for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed,1
1975,LUK,6,NRSV,why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i tell you,so we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed,1
1976,LUK,6,NRSV,i will show you what someone is like who comes to me hears my words and acts on them,while in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering he said to them have you anything here to eat,1
1977,LUK,6,NRSV,that one is like a man building a house who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock when a flood arose the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built,from that time jesus began to proclaim repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near,1
1978,LUK,6,NRSV,but the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,1
1979,LUK,6,NRSV,when the river burst against it immediately it fell and great was the ruin of that house,when the lord saw her he had compassion for her and said to her do not weep,1
1980,LUK,7,NRSV,after jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised,1
1981,LUK,7,NRSV,a centurion there had a slave whom he valued highly and who was ill and close to death,for time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice obtained promises shut the mouths of lions quenched raging fire escaped the edge of the sword won strength out of weakness became mighty in war put foreign armies to flight,1
1982,LUK,7,NRSV,when he heard about jesus he sent some jewish elders to him asking him to come and heal his slave,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith,1
1983,LUK,7,NRSV,when they came to jesus they appealed to him earnestly saying he is worthy of having you do this for him for he loves our people and it is he who built our synagogue for us,and simon and his companions hunted for him,1
1984,LUK,7,NRSV,and jesus went with them but when he was not far from the house the centurion sent friends to say to him lord do not trouble yourself for i am not worthy to have you come under my roof therefore i did not presume to come to you,five days later the high priest ananias came down with some elders and an attorney a certain tertullus and they reported their case against paul to the governor,1
1985,LUK,7,NRSV,but only speak the word and let my servant be healed,when any of you has a grievance against another do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it before the saints,1
1986,LUK,7,NRSV,for i also am a man set under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it,put these things into practice devote yourself to them so that all may see your progress,1
1987,LUK,7,NRSV,when jesus heard this he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd that followed him he said i tell you not even in israel have i found such faith,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor,1
1988,LUK,7,NRSV,when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the slave in good health,just as the church is subject to christ so also wives ought to be in everything to their husbands,1
1989,LUK,7,NRSV,soon afterwards he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish,1
1990,LUK,7,NRSV,as he approached the gate of the town a man who had died was being carried out,on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him zechariah after his father,1
1991,LUK,7,NRSV,he was his mothers only son and she was a widow and with her was a large crowd from the town,i have said this to you so that in me you may have peace,1
1992,LUK,7,NRSV,when the lord saw her he had compassion for her and said to her do not weep,zechariah said to the angel how will i know that this is so,1
1993,LUK,7,NRSV,then he came forward and touched the bier and the bearers stood still,for it is better to suffer for doing good if suffering should be gods will than to suffer for doing evil,1
1994,LUK,7,NRSV,and he said young man i say to you rise the dead man sat up and began to speak and jesus gave him to his mother,every day he was teaching in the temple,1
1995,LUK,7,NRSV,fear seized all of them and they glorified god saying a great prophet has risen among us and god has looked favorably on his people this word about him spread throughout judea and all the surrounding country,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming,1
1996,LUK,7,NRSV,the disciples of john reported all these things to him,every generous act of giving with every perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change,1
1997,LUK,7,NRSV,so john summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the lord to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1
1998,LUK,7,NRSV,when the men had come to him they said john the baptist has sent us to you to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another,and when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you or naked and gave you clothing,1
1999,LUK,7,NRSV,jesus had just then cured many people of diseases plagues and evil spirits and had given sight to many who were blind,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction,1
2000,LUK,7,NRSV,and he answered them go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news brought to them,he was speaking of judas son of simon iscariot for he though one of the twelve was going to betray him,1
2001,LUK,7,NRSV,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me,for john came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him and even after you saw it you did not change your minds and believe him,1
2002,LUK,7,NRSV,when johns messengers had gone jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at,and you know the way to the place where i am going,1
2003,LUK,7,NRSV,a reed shaken by the wind,did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit,1
2004,LUK,7,NRSV,what then did you go out to see,this will be a sign for you you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger,1
2005,LUK,7,NRSV,look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces,but because of false believers secretly brought in who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus so that they might enslave us we did not submit to them even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you,1
2006,LUK,7,NRSV,what then did you go out to see,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god,1
2007,LUK,7,NRSV,yes i tell you and more than a prophet,from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute,1
2008,LUK,7,NRSV,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,1
2009,LUK,7,NRSV,i tell you among those born of women no one is greater than john yet the least in the kingdom of god is greater than he,but martha was distracted by her many tasks so she came to him and asked lord do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself,1
2010,LUK,7,NRSV,and all the people who heard this including the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of god because they had been baptized with johns baptism,by faith he left egypt unafraid of the kings anger for he persevered as though he saw him who is invisible,1
2011,LUK,7,NRSV,but by refusing to be baptized by him the pharisees and the lawyers rejected gods purpose for themselves to what then will i compare the people of this generation and what are they like,i am giving you these commands so that you may love one another,1
2012,LUK,7,NRSV,they are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not weep,a scribe then approached and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go,1
2013,LUK,7,NRSV,for john the baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners nevertheless wisdom is vindicated by all her children,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,1
2014,LUK,7,NRSV,one of the pharisees asked jesus to eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and took his place at the table,let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent we will also do when present,1
2015,LUK,7,NRSV,and a woman in the city who was a sinner having learned that he was eating in the pharisees house brought an alabaster jar of ointment,on the other hand those who prophesy speak to other people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation,1
2016,LUK,7,NRSV,she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair,paul replied whether quickly or not i pray to god that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as i amexcept for these chains,1
2017,LUK,7,NRSV,then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment,long ago god spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken to us by a son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom he also created the worlds,1
2018,LUK,7,NRSV,now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching himthat she is a sinner,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,1
2019,LUK,7,NRSV,jesus spoke up and said to him simon i have something to say to you,i am not writing this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children,1
2020,LUK,7,NRSV,a certain creditor had two debtors one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty,when jesus had finished these parables he left that place,1
2021,LUK,7,NRSV,when they could not pay he canceled the debts for both of them,but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding robe,1
2022,LUK,7,NRSV,now which of them will love him more,then a servantgirl seeing him in the firelight stared at him and said this man also was with him,1
2023,LUK,7,NRSV,simon answered i suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt,one night the lord said to paul in a vision do not be afraid but speak and do not be silent for i am with you and no one will lay a hand on you to harm you for there are many in this city who are my people,1
2024,LUK,7,NRSV,and jesus said to him you have judged rightly,then i saw another angel flying in midheaven with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earthto every nation and tribe and language and people,1
2025,LUK,7,NRSV,then turning toward the woman he said to simon do you see this woman,or what fellowship is there between light and darkness,1
2026,LUK,7,NRSV,i entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them,1
2027,LUK,7,NRSV,you gave me no kiss but from the time i came in she has not stopped kissing my feet,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law,1
2028,LUK,7,NRSV,you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor,1
2029,LUK,7,NRSV,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin,1
2030,LUK,7,NRSV,but the one to whom little is forgiven loves little,then he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are persecuting,1
2031,LUK,7,NRSV,then he said to her your sins are forgiven,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1
2032,LUK,7,NRSV,but those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves who is this who even forgives sins,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare,1
2033,LUK,7,NRSV,and he said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace,the lord answered i am jesus whom you are persecuting,1
2034,LUK,8,NRSV,soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god,after this i saw another angel coming down from heaven having great authority and the earth was made bright with his splendor,1
2035,LUK,8,NRSV,the twelve were with him as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out and joanna the wife of herods steward chuza and susanna and many others who provided for them out of their resources,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,1
2036,LUK,8,NRSV,when a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him he said in a parable a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell on the path and was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption,1
2037,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell on the rock and as it grew up it withered for lack of moisture,i answered who are you lord,1
2038,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell among thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well,1
2039,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell into good soil and when it grew it produced a hundredfold,elijah was a human being like us and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth,1
2040,LUK,8,NRSV,as he said this he called out let anyone with ears to hear listen then his disciples asked him what this parable meant,but they kept asking him then how were your eyes opened,1
2041,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of god but to others i speak in parables so that looking they may not perceive and listening they may not understand,in the morning they did not recognize the land but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if they could,1
2042,LUK,8,NRSV,now the parable is this the seed is the word of god,and the twentyfour elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who is seated on the throne saying amen,1
2043,LUK,8,NRSV,the ones on the path are those who have heard then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved,whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling,1
2044,LUK,8,NRSV,the ones on the rock are those who when they hear the word receive it with joy,and seeing a fig tree by the side of the road he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves,1
2045,LUK,8,NRSV,but these have no root they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away,but some of them said he casts out demons by beelzebul the ruler of the demons,1
2046,LUK,8,NRSV,as for what fell among the thorns these are the ones who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and their fruit does not mature,which means my god my god why have you forsaken me,1
2047,LUK,8,NRSV,but as for that in the good soil these are the ones who when they hear the word hold it fast in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patient endurance,consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners so that you may not grow weary or lose heart,1
2048,LUK,8,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones,1
2049,LUK,8,NRSV,for nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light,so the soldiers their officer and the jewish police arrested jesus and bound him,1
2050,LUK,8,NRSV,then pay attention to how you listen for to those who have more will be given and from those who do not have even what they seem to have will be taken away,when she and her household were baptized she urged us saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come and stay at my home,1
2051,LUK,8,NRSV,then his mother and his brothers came to him but they could not reach him because of the crowd,pilate said to them then what should i do with jesus who is called the messiah,1
2052,LUK,8,NRSV,and he was told your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place,1
2053,LUK,8,NRSV,but he said to them my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it,or am i trying to please people,1
2054,LUK,8,NRSV,one day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go across to the other side of the lake,by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin,1
2055,LUK,8,NRSV,so they put out and while they were sailing he fell asleep,finally beloved whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever is commendable if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things,1
2056,LUK,8,NRSV,a windstorm swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in danger,but jesus came and touched them saying get up and do not be afraid,1
2057,LUK,8,NRSV,they went to him and woke him up shouting master master we are perishing and he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves they ceased and there was a calm,when he had said this he died,1
2058,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to them where is your faith,and he said let anyone with ears to hear listen when he was alone those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables,1
2059,LUK,8,NRSV,they were afraid and amazed and said to one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back,1
2060,LUK,8,NRSV,then they arrived at the country of the gerasenes which is opposite galilee,ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature invisible though they are have been understood and seen through the things he has made,1
2061,LUK,8,NRSV,as he stepped out on land a man of the city who had demons met him,let anyone with ears to hear listen and he said to them pay attention to what you hear the measure you give will be the measure you get and still more will be given you,1
2062,LUK,8,NRSV,for a long time he had worn no clothes and he did not live in a house but in the tombs,is not this the carpenters son,1
2063,LUK,8,NRSV,when he saw jesus he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god,now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions but everything they owned was held in common,1
2064,LUK,8,NRSV,i beg you do not torment me for jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man,for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion,1
2065,LUK,8,NRSV,for many times it had seized him he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds jesus then asked him what is your name,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that,1
2066,LUK,8,NRSV,he said legion for many demons had entered him,epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus greets you,1
2067,LUK,8,NRSV,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss,and he did not do many deeds of power there because of their unbelief,1
2068,LUK,8,NRSV,now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding and the demons begged jesus to let them enter these,immediately they left their nets and followed him,1
2069,LUK,8,NRSV,then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned,slaves obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as you obey christ not only while being watched and in order to please them but as slaves of christ doing the will of god from the heart,1
2070,LUK,8,NRSV,when the swineherds saw what had happened they ran off and told it in the city and in the country,when i came to troas to proclaim the good news of christ a door was opened for me in the lord but my mind could not rest because i did not find my brother titus there,1
2071,LUK,8,NRSV,then people came out to see what had happened and when they came to jesus they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind,i tertius the writer of this letter greet you in the lord,1
2072,LUK,8,NRSV,those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed,but jesus answered him let it be so now for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness,1
2073,LUK,8,NRSV,then all the people of the surrounding country of the gerasenes asked jesus to leave them for they were seized with great fear,i did not shrink from doing anything helpful proclaiming the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house as i testified to both jews and greeks about repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus,1
2074,LUK,8,NRSV,so he got into the boat and returned,then they tried to arrest him but no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come,1
2075,LUK,8,NRSV,the man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying return to your home and declare how much god has done for you,for the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field its flower falls and its beauty perishes,1
2076,LUK,8,NRSV,so he went away proclaiming throughout the city how much jesus had done for him,now there came to ephesus a jew named apollos a native of alexandria,1
2077,LUK,8,NRSV,now when jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all waiting for him,now herod the ruler heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen,1
2078,LUK,8,NRSV,just then there came a man named jairus a leader of the synagogue,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him,1
2079,LUK,8,NRSV,he fell at jesus feet and begged him to come to his house for he had an only daughter about twelve years old who was dying,paul said i am appealing to the emperors tribunal this is where i should be tried,1
2080,LUK,8,NRSV,as he went the crowds pressed in on him,once more they said hallelujah the smoke goes up from her forever and ever,1
2081,LUK,8,NRSV,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years and though she had spent all she had on physicians no one could cure her,and he fixed his attention on them expecting to receive something from them,1
2082,LUK,8,NRSV,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped,then some of his disciples said to one another what does he mean by saying to us a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me and because i am going to the father,1
2083,LUK,8,NRSV,then jesus asked who touched me,the god who made the world and everything in it he who is lord of heaven and earth does not live in shrines made by human hands nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things,1
2084,LUK,8,NRSV,when all denied it peter said master the crowds surround you and press in on you,but peter said man i do not know what you are talking about at that moment while he was still speaking the cock crowed,1
2085,LUK,8,NRSV,but jesus said someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me,through silvanus whom i consider a faithful brother i have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of god,1
2086,LUK,8,NRSV,when the woman saw that she could not remain hidden she came trembling and falling down before him she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed,one of the pharisees asked jesus to eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and took his place at the table,1
2087,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace,it was declared at first through the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard him while god added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will,1
2088,LUK,8,NRSV,while he was still speaking someone came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer,and to what should i compare it,1
2089,LUK,8,NRSV,when jesus heard this he replied do not fear,then peter said to her how is it that you have agreed together to put the spirit of the lord to the test,1
2090,LUK,8,NRSV,only believe and she will be saved,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard,1
2091,LUK,8,NRSV,when he came to the house he did not allow anyone to enter with him except peter john and james and the childs father and mother,for david after he had served the purpose of god in his own generation died was laid beside his ancestors and experienced corruption but he whom god raised up experienced no corruption,1
2092,LUK,8,NRSV,they were all weeping and wailing for her but he said do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping,it hurts you to kick against the goads,1
2093,LUK,8,NRSV,and they laughed at him knowing that she was dead,when some of the bystanders heard it they said listen he is calling for elijah,1
2094,LUK,8,NRSV,but he took her by the hand and called out child get up her spirit returned and she got up at once,but they did not understand what he said to them,1
2095,LUK,8,NRSV,then he directed them to give her something to eat,i have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling,1
2096,LUK,8,NRSV,her parents were astounded but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened,but he said to him friend who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you,1
2097,LUK,9,NRSV,then jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal,so because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i am about to spit you out of my mouth,1
2098,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me,1
2099,LUK,9,NRSV,whatever house you enter stay there and leave from there,for this reason rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith not paying attention to jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth,1
2100,LUK,9,NRSV,wherever they do not welcome you as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them,that is not the way you learned christ for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus,1
2101,LUK,9,NRSV,they departed and went through the villages bringing the good news and curing diseases everywhere,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,1
2102,LUK,9,NRSV,now herod the ruler heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen,he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and bring simon who is called peter he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved,1
2103,LUK,9,NRSV,herod said john i beheaded but who is this about whom i hear such things,what then is to be done,1
2104,LUK,9,NRSV,and he tried to see him,these have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting selfimposed piety humility and severe treatment of the body but they are of no value in checking selfindulgence,1
2105,LUK,9,NRSV,on their return the apostles told jesus all they had done,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,1
2106,LUK,9,NRSV,he took them with him and withdrew privately to a city called bethsaida,all nations will come and worship before you for your judgments have been revealed,1
2107,LUK,9,NRSV,when the crowds found out about it they followed him and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and healed those who needed to be cured,while they were there the time came for her to deliver her child,1
2108,LUK,9,NRSV,the day was drawing to a close and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and get provisions for we are here in a deserted place,he saw the linen wrappings lying there and the cloth that had been on jesus head not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself,1
2109,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said to them you give them something to eat,because i do not love you,1
2110,LUK,9,NRSV,they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people,he said to them have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1
2111,LUK,9,NRSV,for there were about five thousand men,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet,1
2112,LUK,9,NRSV,and he said to his disciples make them sit down in groups of about fifty each,then they sent to him some pharisees and some herodians to trap him in what he said,1
2113,LUK,9,NRSV,they did so and made them all sit down,and just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed,1
2114,LUK,9,NRSV,and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them,1
2115,LUK,9,NRSV,and all ate and were filled,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done,1
2116,LUK,9,NRSV,what was left over was gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces,after this the lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go,1
2117,LUK,9,NRSV,once when jesus was praying alone with only the disciples near him he asked them who do the crowds say that i am,then jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart,1
2118,LUK,9,NRSV,they answered john the baptist but others elijah and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen,so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say,1
2119,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am,i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor,1
2120,LUK,9,NRSV,peter answered the messiah of god,welcome him then in the lord with all joy and honor such people because he came close to death for the work of christ risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me,1
2121,LUK,9,NRSV,he sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone saying the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,some of them were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a great many of the devout greeks and not a few of the leading women,1
2122,LUK,9,NRSV,then he said to them all if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me,can a demon open the eyes of the blind,1
2123,LUK,9,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it,for whoever has died is freed from sin,1
2124,LUK,9,NRSV,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
2125,LUK,9,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words of them the son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels,when elizabeth heard marys greeting the child leaped in her womb,1
2126,LUK,9,NRSV,but truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god,when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near,1
2127,LUK,9,NRSV,now about eight days after these sayings jesus took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray,this is the second death the lake of fire and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire,1
2128,LUK,9,NRSV,and while he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became dazzling white,so they are no longer two but one flesh,1
2129,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him,and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away,1
2130,LUK,9,NRSV,they appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem,for many live as enemies of the cross of christ i have often told you of them and now i tell you even with tears,1
2131,LUK,9,NRSV,now peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep but since they had stayed awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him,for his life is taken away from the earth,1
2132,LUK,9,NRSV,just as they were leaving him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijahnot knowing what he said,and the angel said to me write this blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb,1
2133,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were terrified as they entered the cloud,but solid food is for the mature for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil,1
2134,LUK,9,NRSV,then from the cloud came a voice that said this is my son my chosen listen to him when the voice had spoken jesus was found alone,the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord,1
2135,LUK,9,NRSV,and they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me,1
2136,LUK,9,NRSV,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him,but he turned and rebuked them,1
2137,LUK,9,NRSV,just then a man from the crowd shouted teacher i beg you to look at my son he is my only child,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him,1
2138,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly a spirit seizes him and all at once he shrieks,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child,1
2139,LUK,9,NRSV,it convulses him until he foams at the mouth it mauls him and will scarcely leave him,draw near to god and he will draw near to you,1
2140,LUK,9,NRSV,i begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not,from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force,1
2141,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you and bear with you,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death,1
2142,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was coming the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions,indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel,1
2143,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father,zacchaeus stood there and said to the lord look half of my possessions lord i will give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i will pay back four times as much,1
2144,LUK,9,NRSV,and all were astounded at the greatness of god,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,1
2145,LUK,9,NRSV,while everyone was amazed at all that he was doing he said to his disciples let these words sink into your ears the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ,1
2146,LUK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand this saying its meaning was concealed from them so that they could not perceive it,do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god,1
2147,LUK,9,NRSV,and they were afraid to ask him about this saying,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well,1
2148,LUK,9,NRSV,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest,jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in hebrew rabbouni which means teacher,1
2149,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus aware of their inner thoughts took a little child and put it by his side and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for the least among all of you is the greatest,but now because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time you will become mute unable to speak until the day these things occur,1
2150,LUK,9,NRSV,john answered master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles away and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother,1
2151,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him do not stop him for whoever is not against you is for you,he will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1
2152,LUK,9,NRSV,when the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to jerusalem,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury,1
2153,LUK,9,NRSV,and he sent messengers ahead of him,but even if i am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me,1
2154,LUK,9,NRSV,on their way they entered a village of the samaritans to make ready for him but they did not receive him because his face was set toward jerusalem,early in the morning he came again to the temple,1
2155,LUK,9,NRSV,when his disciples james and john saw it they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them,john testified to him and cried out this was he of whom i said he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me,1
2156,LUK,9,NRSV,but he turned and rebuked them,and he went out into the forecourt,1
2157,LUK,9,NRSV,then they went on to another village,we know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another,1
2158,LUK,9,NRSV,as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin,1
2159,LUK,9,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head,do not fear what you are about to suffer,1
2160,LUK,9,NRSV,to another he said follow me,jews do not share things in common with samaritans jesus answered her if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water,1
2161,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said lord first let me go and bury my father,also he said write this for these words are trustworthy and true,1
2162,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him let the dead bury their own dead but as for you go and proclaim the kingdom of god,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1
2163,LUK,9,NRSV,another said i will follow you lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home,when they had washed her they laid her in a room upstairs,1
2164,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of god,when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey and all of them with wives and children escorted us outside the city,1
2165,LUK,10,NRSV,after this the lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go,all things are lawful for me but not all things are beneficial,1
2166,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to them the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god,1
2167,LUK,10,NRSV,see i am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves,for though i am free with respect to all i have made myself a slave to all so that i might win more of them,1
2168,LUK,10,NRSV,carry no purse no bag no sandals and greet no one on the road,all of them are seeking their own interests not those of jesus christ,1
2169,LUK,10,NRSV,whatever house you enter first say peace to this house and if anyone is there who shares in peace your peace will rest on that person but if not it will return to you,if you do boast remember that it is not you that support the root but the root that supports you,1
2170,LUK,10,NRSV,remain in the same house eating and drinking whatever they provide for the laborer deserves to be paid,they also took his tunic now the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from the top,1
2171,LUK,10,NRSV,do not move about from house to house,since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word i too decided after investigating everything carefully from the very first to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed,1
2172,LUK,10,NRSV,whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you eat what is set before you cure the sick who are there and say to them the kingdom of god has come near to you,night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith,1
2173,LUK,10,NRSV,but whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you go out into its streets and say even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you,when they heard this they were silenced,1
2174,LUK,10,NRSV,yet know this the kingdom of god has come near,then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat,1
2175,LUK,10,NRSV,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town,he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created things visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powersall things have been created through him and for him,1
2176,LUK,10,NRSV,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes,then pilate wondered if he were already dead and summoning the centurion he asked him whether he had been dead for some time,1
2177,LUK,10,NRSV,but at the judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you,he said this to test him for he himself knew what he was going to do,1
2178,LUK,10,NRSV,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven,do you wish to have no fear of the authority,1
2179,LUK,10,NRSV,no you will be brought down to hades,those who love their life lose it and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life,1
2180,LUK,10,NRSV,whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me,by faith jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of joseph bowing in worship over the top of his staff,1
2181,LUK,10,NRSV,the seventy returned with joy saying lord in your name even the demons submit to us he said to them i watched satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning,but if you endure when you do right and suffer for it you have gods approval,1
2182,LUK,10,NRSV,see i have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing will hurt you,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,1
2183,LUK,10,NRSV,nevertheless do not rejoice at this that the spirits submit to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven,and as he sat at dinner in levis house many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting with jesus and his disciplesfor there were many who followed him,1
2184,LUK,10,NRSV,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,but when herod heard of it he said john whom i beheaded has been raised,1
2185,LUK,10,NRSV,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father or who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him,no one will snatch them out of my hand,1
2186,LUK,10,NRSV,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,jesus said i am and you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of the power and coming with the clouds of heaven,1
2187,LUK,10,NRSV,just then a lawyer stood up to test jesus,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else,1
2188,LUK,10,NRSV,teacher he said what must i do to inherit eternal life,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us,1
2189,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to him what is written in the law,let anyone with ears listen the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,1
2190,LUK,10,NRSV,he answered you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself,then another angel came out of the temple in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle,1
2191,LUK,10,NRSV,and he said to him you have given the right answer do this and you will live,i hope therefore to send him as soon as i see how things go with me and i trust in the lord that i will also come soon,1
2192,LUK,10,NRSV,but wanting to justify himself he asked jesus and who is my neighbor,they were greatly astounded and said to one another then who can be saved,1
2193,LUK,10,NRSV,jesus replied a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and fell into the hands of robbers who stripped him beat him and went away leaving him half dead,they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers,1
2194,LUK,10,NRSV,now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side,and all who sat in the council looked intently at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel,1
2195,LUK,10,NRSV,so likewise a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side,for i am longing to see you so that i may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you or rather so that we may be mutually encouraged by each others faith both yours and mine,1
2196,LUK,10,NRSV,but a samaritan while traveling came near him and when he saw him he was moved with pity,what i am saying brothers and sisters is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable,1
2197,LUK,10,NRSV,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them,peter an apostle of jesus christ to the exiles of the dispersion in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia who have been chosen and destined by god the father and sanctified by the spirit to be obedient to jesus christ and to be sprinkled with his blood may grace and peace be yours in abundance,1
2198,LUK,10,NRSV,then he put him on his own animal brought him to an inn and took care of him,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way,1
2199,LUK,10,NRSV,the next day he took out two denarii gave them to the innkeeper and said take care of him and when i come back i will repay you whatever more you spend,when a woman is in labor she has pain because her hour has come,1
2200,LUK,10,NRSV,which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers,we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ,1
2201,LUK,10,NRSV,he said the one who showed him mercy,then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor david hosanna in the highest heaven then he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve,1
2202,LUK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him go and do likewise,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account,1
2203,LUK,10,NRSV,now as they went on their way he entered a certain village where a woman named martha welcomed him into her home,but i say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister you will be liable to judgment and if you insult a brother or sister you will be liable to the council and if you say you fool you will be liable to the hell of fire,1
2204,LUK,10,NRSV,she had a sister named mary who sat at the lords feet and listened to what he was saying,here is a call for the endurance of the saints those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of jesus,1
2205,LUK,10,NRSV,but martha was distracted by her many tasks so she came to him and asked lord do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,1
2206,LUK,10,NRSV,tell her then to help me,so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david to the deportation to babylon fourteen generations and from the deportation to babylon to the messiah fourteen generations,1
2207,LUK,10,NRSV,but the lord answered her martha martha you are worried and distracted by many things there is need of only one thing,he strictly ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat,1
2208,LUK,10,NRSV,mary has chosen the better part which will not be taken away from her,the young men came and wrapped up his body then carried him out and buried him,1
2209,LUK,11,NRSV,he was praying in a certain place and after he had finished one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray as john taught his disciples,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,1
2210,LUK,11,NRSV,he said to them when you pray say father hallowed be your name,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,1
2211,LUK,11,NRSV,give us each day our daily bread,if there is anything they desire to know let them ask their husbands at home,1
2212,LUK,11,NRSV,and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us,as for those who in the present age are rich command them not to be haughty or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but rather on god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment,1
2213,LUK,11,NRSV,and do not bring us to the time of trial,then many will fall away and they will betray one another and hate one another,1
2214,LUK,11,NRSV,and he said to them suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves of bread for a friend of mine has arrived and i have nothing to set before him,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy,1
2215,LUK,11,NRSV,and he answers from within do not bother me the door has already been locked and my children are with me in bed i cannot get up and give you anything,when elizabeth heard marys greeting the child leaped in her womb,1
2216,LUK,11,NRSV,i tell you even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs,then they led him out to crucify him,1
2217,LUK,11,NRSV,so i say to you ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,you will know them by their fruits,1
2218,LUK,11,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened,for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me,1
2219,LUK,11,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for a fish will give a snake instead of a fish,then the other came saying lord here is your pound,1
2220,LUK,11,NRSV,or if the child asks for an egg will give a scorpion,do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom christ died,1
2221,LUK,11,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will the heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask him now he was casting out a demon that was mute when the demon had gone out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed,show me the coin used for the tax,1
2222,LUK,11,NRSV,but some of them said he casts out demons by beelzebul the ruler of the demons,so in the present case i tell you keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow themin that case you may even be found fighting against god they were convinced by him and when they had called in the apostles they had them flogged,1
2223,LUK,11,NRSV,others to test him kept demanding from him a sign from heaven,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you,1
2224,LUK,11,NRSV,but he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert and house falls on house,for they do not wash their hands before they eat,1
2225,LUK,11,NRSV,if satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret,1
2226,LUK,11,NRSV,for you say that i cast out the demons by beelzebul,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit,1
2227,LUK,11,NRSV,now if i cast out the demons by beelzebul by whom do your exorcists cast them out,but since we belong to the day let us be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation,1
2228,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore they will be your judges,and how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent,1
2229,LUK,11,NRSV,but if it is by the finger of god that i cast out the demons then the kingdom of god has come to you,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,1
2230,LUK,11,NRSV,when a strong man fully armed guards his castle his property is safe,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron,1
2231,LUK,11,NRSV,but when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder, then jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they cast lots to divide his clothing,1
2232,LUK,11,NRSV,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters,love does no wrong to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law,1
2233,LUK,11,NRSV,when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but not finding any it says i will return to my house from which i came,then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift,1
2234,LUK,11,NRSV,when it comes it finds it swept and put in order,those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church rather they must serve them all the more since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved,1
2235,LUK,11,NRSV,then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first,for we know brothers and sisters beloved by god that he has chosen you because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake,1
2236,LUK,11,NRSV,while he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you but he said blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it when the crowds were increasing he began to say this generation is an evil generation it asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah,but just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripturei believed and so i spokewe also believe and so we speak because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus will raise us also with jesus and will bring us with you into his presence,1
2237,LUK,11,NRSV,for just as jonah became a sign to the people of nineveh so the son of man will be to this generation,but i will stay in ephesus until pentecost for a wide door for effective work has opened to me and there are many adversaries,1
2238,LUK,11,NRSV,the queen of the south will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here no one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light,no one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends,1
2239,LUK,11,NRSV,your eye is the lamp of your body,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do,1
2240,LUK,11,NRSV,if your eye is healthy your whole body is full of light but if it is not healthy your body is full of darkness,what i mean is that each of you says i belong to paul or i belong to apollos or i belong to cephas or i belong to christ,1
2241,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness,woe to you when all speak well of you for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets,1
2242,LUK,11,NRSV,if then your whole body is full of light with no part of it in darkness it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays,but jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house,1
2243,LUK,11,NRSV,while he was speaking a pharisee invited him to dine with him so he went in and took his place at the table,some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath,1
2244,LUK,11,NRSV,the pharisee was amazed to see that he did not first wash before dinner,but anyone united to the lord becomes one spirit with him,1
2245,LUK,11,NRSV,then the lord said to him now you pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside you are full of greed and wickedness,hallelujah and from the throne came a voice saying praise our god all you his servants and all who fear him small and great,1
2246,LUK,11,NRSV,you fools did not the one who made the outside make the inside also,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem,1
2247,LUK,11,NRSV,so give for alms those things that are within and see everything will be clean for you,but we would like to hear from you what you think for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against,1
2248,LUK,11,NRSV,but woe to you pharisees for you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds and neglect justice and the love of god it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him,1
2249,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you pharisees for you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,supposing him to be the gardener she said to him sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have laid him and i will take him away,1
2250,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you for you are like unmarked graves and people walk over them without realizing it,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand,1
2251,LUK,11,NRSV,one of the lawyers answered him teacher when you say these things you insult us too,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,1
2252,LUK,11,NRSV,and he said woe also to you lawyers for you load people with burdens hard to bear and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them,it was not after but before he was circumcised,1
2253,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed,he listened to paul as he was speaking,1
2254,LUK,11,NRSV,so you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors for they killed them and you build their tombs,if an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience,1
2255,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore also the wisdom of god said i will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and persecute so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary,and looking at those who sat around him he said here are my mother and my brothers whoever does the will of god is my brother and sister and mother,1
2256,LUK,11,NRSV,yes i tell you it will be charged against this generation,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him,1
2257,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not enter yourselves and you hindered those who were entering,john answered master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us,1
2258,LUK,11,NRSV,when he went outside the scribes and the pharisees began to be very hostile toward him and to crossexamine him about many things lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say,when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas also the books and above all the parchments,1
2259,LUK,12,NRSV,meanwhile when the crowd gathered by the thousands so that they trampled on one another he began to speak first to his disciples beware of the yeast of the pharisees that is their hypocrisy,and they shall not teach one another or say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest,1
2260,LUK,12,NRSV,nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known,immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed and he began to speak praising god,1
2261,LUK,12,NRSV,therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops,do not speak evil against one another brothers and sisters,1
2262,LUK,12,NRSV,i tell you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after that can do nothing more,this was to fulfill what the scripture says they divided my clothes among themselves and for my clothing they cast lots,1
2263,LUK,12,NRSV,but i will warn you whom to fear fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell,and whenever you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners so that they may be seen by others,1
2264,LUK,12,NRSV,yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies,and again here am i and the children whom god has given me,1
2265,LUK,12,NRSV,yet not one of them is forgotten in gods sight,judas who betrayed him was standing with them,1
2266,LUK,12,NRSV,but even the hairs of your head are all counted,but god who is rich in mercy out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus,1
2267,LUK,12,NRSV,do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows,the hour is coming when i will no longer speak to you in figures but will tell you plainly of the father,1
2268,LUK,12,NRSV,and i tell you everyone who acknowledges me before others the son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of god but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of god,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer,1
2269,LUK,12,NRSV,and everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven,a wife is bound as long as her husband lives,1
2270,LUK,12,NRSV,when they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say for the holy spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say,when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put an end to childish ways,1
2271,LUK,12,NRSV,someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me,i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind just as the testimony of christ has been strengthened among you so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ,1
2272,LUK,12,NRSV,but he said to him friend who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you,remember then from what you have fallen repent and do the works you did at first,1
2273,LUK,12,NRSV,and he said to them take care be on your guard against all kinds of greed for ones life does not consist in the abundance of possessions,just then a lawyer stood up to test jesus,1
2274,LUK,12,NRSV,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly,all of them deserted him and fled,1
2275,LUK,12,NRSV,and he thought to himself what should i do for i have no place to store my crops,peter said to him you will never wash my feet,1
2276,LUK,12,NRSV,then he said i will do this i will pull down my barns and build larger ones and there i will store all my grain and my goods,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well,1
2277,LUK,12,NRSV,and i will say to my soul soul you have ample goods laid up for many years relax eat drink be merry,for we know the one who said vengeance is mine i will repay,1
2278,LUK,12,NRSV,but god said to him you fool this very night your life is being demanded of you,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor,1
2279,LUK,12,NRSV,and the things you have prepared whose will they be,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder,1
2280,LUK,12,NRSV,so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god,he said go into the city to a certain man and say to him the teacher says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples,1
2281,LUK,12,NRSV,he said to his disciples therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear,figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush,1
2282,LUK,12,NRSV,for life is more than food and the body more than clothing,adulterers do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god,1
2283,LUK,12,NRSV,consider the ravens they neither sow nor reap they have neither storehouse nor barn and yet god feeds them,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,1
2284,LUK,12,NRSV,of how much more value are you than the birds and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life,i have found in him no ground for the sentence of death i will therefore have him flogged and then release him,1
2285,LUK,12,NRSV,if then you are not able to do so small a thing as that why do you worry about the rest,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1
2286,LUK,12,NRSV,consider the lilies how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these,the true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world,1
2287,LUK,12,NRSV,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying,you say we know that gods judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth,1
2288,LUK,12,NRSV,for it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things and your father knows that you need them,and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine and the herd numbering about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea,1
2289,LUK,12,NRSV,instead strive for his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well,we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from,1
2290,LUK,12,NRSV,do not be afraid little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom,thus says the lord who has been making these things known from long ago,1
2291,LUK,12,NRSV,sell your possessions and give alms,while paul was waiting for them in athens he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols,1
2292,LUK,12,NRSV,make purses for yourselves that do not wear out an unfailing treasure in heaven where no thief comes near and no moth destroys,then jesus filled with the power of the spirit returned to galilee and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country,1
2293,LUK,12,NRSV,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also,guided by the spirit simeon came into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what was customary under the law simeon took him in his arms and praised god saying master now you are dismissing your servant in peace according to your word for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people israel,1
2294,LUK,12,NRSV,be dressed for action and have your lamps lit be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks,then he said to his slaves the wedding is ready but those invited were not worthy,1
2295,LUK,12,NRSV,blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes truly i tell you he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat and he will come and serve them,so he divided his property between them,1
2296,LUK,12,NRSV,if he comes during the middle of the night or near dawn and finds them so blessed are those slaves,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,1
2297,LUK,12,NRSV,but know this if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he would not have let his house be broken into,their feet are swift to shed blood ruin and misery are in their paths and the way of peace they have not known,1
2298,LUK,12,NRSV,you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour,you then my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well,1
2299,LUK,12,NRSV,peter said lord are you telling this parable for us or for everyone,they were so fierce that no one could pass that way,1
2300,LUK,12,NRSV,and the lord said who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves to give them their allowance of food at the proper time,and the things you have prepared whose will they be,1
2301,LUK,12,NRSV,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives,all things are lawful but not all things are beneficial,1
2302,LUK,12,NRSV,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions,or who has been his counselor,1
2303,LUK,12,NRSV,but if that slave says to himself my master is delayed in coming and if he begins to beat the other slaves men and women and to eat and drink and get drunk the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful,when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps,1
2304,LUK,12,NRSV,that slave who knew what his master wanted but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted will receive a severe beating,then he began to speak and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,1
2305,LUK,12,NRSV,but the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating,then he said to them is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to kill,1
2306,LUK,12,NRSV,from everyone to whom much has been given much will be required and from the one to whom much has been entrusted even more will be demanded,he gave her his hand and helped her up,1
2307,LUK,12,NRSV,i came to bring fire to the earth and how i wish it were already kindled i have a baptism with which to be baptized and what stress i am under until it is completed do you think that i have come to bring peace to the earth,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,1
2308,LUK,12,NRSV,no i tell you but rather division from now on five in one household will be divided three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw,we are ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete,1
2309,LUK,12,NRSV,he also said to the crowds when you see a cloud rising in the west you immediately say it is going to rain and so it happens,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us,1
2310,LUK,12,NRSV,and when you see the south wind blowing you say there will be scorching heat and it happens,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything,1
2311,LUK,12,NRSV,you hypocrites you know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky but why do you not know how to interpret the present time,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank,1
2312,LUK,12,NRSV,and why do you not judge for yourselves what is right,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death,1
2313,LUK,12,NRSV,thus when you go with your accuser before a magistrate on the way make an effort to settle the case or you may be dragged before the judge and the judge hand you over to the officer and the officer throw you in prison,jesus said to them very truly i tell you the son can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father does the son does likewise,1
2314,LUK,12,NRSV,i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny,do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered,1
2315,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very time there were some present who told him about the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices,when those hired about five oclock came each of them received the usual daily wage,1
2316,LUK,13,NRSV,he asked them do you think that because these galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other galileans,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away,1
2317,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,1
2318,LUK,13,NRSV,or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of siloam fell on themdo you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in jerusalem,they count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime,1
2319,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish just as they did,or what is the value of circumcision,1
2320,LUK,13,NRSV,then he told this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and found none,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,1
2321,LUK,13,NRSV,so he said to the gardener see here for three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and still i find none,i know a person in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heavenwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows,1
2322,LUK,13,NRSV,cut it down why should it be wasting the soil,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table,1
2323,LUK,13,NRSV,he replied sir let it alone for one more year until i dig around it and put manure on it,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness,1
2324,LUK,13,NRSV,if it bears fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1
2325,LUK,13,NRSV,now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,1
2326,LUK,13,NRSV,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years,and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,1
2327,LUK,13,NRSV,she was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight,then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his messiah and he will reign forever and ever,1
2328,LUK,13,NRSV,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment,they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it,1
2329,LUK,13,NRSV,when he laid his hands on her immediately she stood up straight and began praising god,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,1
2330,LUK,13,NRSV,but the leader of the synagogue indignant because jesus had cured on the sabbath kept saying to the crowd there are six days on which work ought to be done come on those days and be cured and not on the sabbath day,they were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes,1
2331,LUK,13,NRSV,but the lord answered him and said you hypocrites does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh,1
2332,LUK,13,NRSV,and ought not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage,1
2333,LUK,13,NRSV,when he said this all his opponents were put to shame and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day,1
2334,LUK,13,NRSV,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,1
2335,LUK,13,NRSV,and to what should i compare it,so they answered that they did not know where it came from,1
2336,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made nests in its branches,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,1
2337,LUK,13,NRSV,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god,and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink,1
2338,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body,1
2339,LUK,13,NRSV,jesus went through one town and village after another teaching as he made his way to jerusalem,very truly i tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice you will have pain but your pain will turn into joy,1
2340,LUK,13,NRSV,someone asked him lord will only a few be saved,where a will is involved the death of the one who made it must be established,1
2341,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them strive to enter through the narrow door for many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants the prophets,1
2342,LUK,13,NRSV,when once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying lord open to us then in reply he will say to you i do not know where you come from,you brood of vipers how can you speak good things when you are evil,1
2343,LUK,13,NRSV,then you will begin to say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets,so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do everything for the glory of god,1
2344,LUK,13,NRSV,but he will say i do not know where you come from go away from me all you evildoers there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrown out,paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and our brother sosthenes to the church of god that is in corinth to those who are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our lord jesus christ both their lord and ours grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1
2345,LUK,13,NRSV,then people will come from east and west from north and south and will eat in the kingdom of god,if you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin you will ask and god will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal,1
2346,LUK,13,NRSV,indeed some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last,thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets,1
2347,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very hour some pharisees came and said to him get away from here for herod wants to kill you,then i saw the lamb open one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures call out as with a voice of thunder come i looked and there was a white horse its rider had a bow a crown was given to him and he came out conquering and to conquer,1
2348,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them go and tell that fox for me listen i am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow and on the third day i finish my work,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat,1
2349,LUK,13,NRSV,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin,1
2350,LUK,13,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing see your house is left to you,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father,1
2351,LUK,13,NRSV,and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,a certain young man was following him wearing nothing but a linen cloth,1
2352,LUK,14,NRSV,on one occasion when jesus was going to the house of a leader of the pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath they were watching him closely,jesus said to him if you wish to be perfect go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me,1
2353,LUK,14,NRSV,just then in front of him there was a man who had dropsy,whoever says i am in the light while hating a brother or sister is still in the darkness,1
2354,LUK,14,NRSV,and jesus asked the lawyers and pharisees is it lawful to cure people on the sabbath or not,therefore my beloved just as you have always obeyed me not only in my presence but much more now in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who is at work in you enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure,1
2355,LUK,14,NRSV,so jesus took him and healed him and sent him away,simeon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ may grace and peace be yours in abundance in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord,1
2356,LUK,14,NRSV,then he said to them if one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day,the men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one,1
2357,LUK,14,NRSV,and they could not reply to this,by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure,1
2358,LUK,14,NRSV,when he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor he told them a parable,but get up and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do,1
2359,LUK,14,NRSV,when you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet do not sit down at the place of honor in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you give this person your place and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1
2360,LUK,14,NRSV,but when you are invited go and sit down at the lowest place so that when your host comes he may say to you friend move up higher then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb,1
2361,LUK,14,NRSV,for all who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted,adulterers do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god,1
2362,LUK,14,NRSV,he said also to the one who had invited him when you give a luncheon or a dinner do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors in case they may invite you in return and you would be repaid,but strive first for the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well,1
2363,LUK,14,NRSV,but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame and the blind,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth,1
2364,LUK,14,NRSV,and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous,and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my names sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life,1
2365,LUK,14,NRSV,one of the dinner guests on hearing this said to him blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of god then jesus said to him someone gave a great dinner and invited many,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,1
2366,LUK,14,NRSV,at the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited come for everything is ready now,yet this is to your credit you hate the works of the nicolaitans which i also hate,1
2367,LUK,14,NRSV,but they all alike began to make excuses,then after completing their mission barnabas and saul returned to jerusalem and brought with them john whose other name was mark,1
2368,LUK,14,NRSV,the first said to him i have bought a piece of land and i must go out and see it please accept my regrets,for this reason though i am bold enough in christ to command you to do your duty yet i would rather appeal to you on the basis of loveand i paul do this as an old man and now also as a prisoner of christ jesus,1
2369,LUK,14,NRSV,another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i am going to try them out please accept my regrets,when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god with boldness,1
2370,LUK,14,NRSV,another said i have just been married and therefore i cannot come,those conflicts and disputes among you where do they come from,1
2371,LUK,14,NRSV,so the slave returned and reported this to his master,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,1
2372,LUK,14,NRSV,then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame,you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment,1
2373,LUK,14,NRSV,and the slave said sir what you ordered has been done and there is still room,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god,1
2374,LUK,14,NRSV,then the master said to the slave go out into the roads and lanes and compel people to come in so that my house may be filled,so they disagreed with each other and as they were leaving paul made one further statement the holy spirit was right in saying to your ancestors through the prophet isaiah go to this people and say you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive,1
2375,LUK,14,NRSV,for i tell you none of those who were invited will taste my dinner,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword,1
2376,LUK,14,NRSV,now large crowds were traveling with him and he turned and said to them whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and even life itself cannot be my disciple,beware i am throwing her on a bed and those who commit adultery with her i am throwing into great distress unless they repent of her doings and i will strike her children dead,1
2377,LUK,14,NRSV,whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple,i say nothing about your owing me even your own self,1
2378,LUK,14,NRSV,for which of you intending to build a tower does not first sit down and estimate the cost to see whether he has enough to complete it,they were all weeping and wailing for her but he said do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping,1
2379,LUK,14,NRSV,otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all who see it will begin to ridicule him saying this fellow began to build and was not able to finish,since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word i too decided after investigating everything carefully from the very first to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed,1
2380,LUK,14,NRSV,or what king going out to wage war against another king will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand,but now with no further place for me in these regions i desire as i have for many years to come to you when i go to spain,1
2381,LUK,14,NRSV,if he cannot then while the other is still far away he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace,god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins,1
2382,LUK,14,NRSV,so therefore none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions,but if we say of human origin all the people will stone us for they are convinced that john was a prophet,1
2383,LUK,14,NRSV,salt is good but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored,he said to them you say that i am,1
2384,LUK,14,NRSV,it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile they throw it away,he replied your brother has come and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has got him back safe and sound,1
2385,LUK,14,NRSV,let anyone with ears to hear listen,therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness,1
2386,LUK,15,NRSV,now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him,fathers do not provoke your children or they may lose heart,1
2387,LUK,15,NRSV,and the pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying this fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them,but jesus said to him follow me and let the dead bury their own dead,1
2388,LUK,15,NRSV,so he told them this parable which one of you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them does not leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it,jesus used this figure of speech with them but they did not understand what he was saying to them,1
2389,LUK,15,NRSV,when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices,with the spirit and power of elijah he will go before him to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the lord,1
2390,LUK,15,NRSV,and when he comes home he calls together his friends and neighbors saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep that was lost,by no means for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion,1
2391,LUK,15,NRSV,just so i tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninetynine righteous persons who need no repentance,you are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels and yet you have not kept it,1
2392,LUK,15,NRSV,or what woman having ten silver coins if she loses one of them does not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it,when evening had come and since it was the day of preparation that is the day before the sabbath joseph of arimathea a respected member of the council who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god went boldly to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,1
2393,LUK,15,NRSV,when she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the coin that i had lost,come see the place where he lay,1
2394,LUK,15,NRSV,just so i tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents,parthians medes elamites and residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya belonging to cyrene and visitors from rome both jews and proselytes cretans and arabsin our own languages we hear them speaking about gods deeds of power,1
2395,LUK,15,NRSV,then jesus said there was a man who had two sons,but god turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness o house of israel,1
2396,LUK,15,NRSV,the younger of them said to his father father give me the share of the property that will belong to me,if then god gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i could hinder god,1
2397,LUK,15,NRSV,so he divided his property between them,if i tell the truth why do you not believe me,1
2398,LUK,15,NRSV,a few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country and there he squandered his property in dissolute living,but he said lord first let me go and bury my father,1
2399,LUK,15,NRSV,when he had spent everything a severe famine took place throughout that country and he began to be in need,he first found his brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated anointed ,1
2400,LUK,15,NRSV,so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs,it was a cave and a stone was lying against it,1
2401,LUK,15,NRSV,he would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating and no one gave him anything,therefore come out from them and be separate from them says the lord and touch nothing unclean then i will welcome you and i will be your father and you shall be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty,1
2402,LUK,15,NRSV,but when he came to himself he said how many of my fathers hired hands have bread enough and to spare but here i am dying of hunger i will get up and go to my father and i will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son treat me like one of your hired hands,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds,1
2403,LUK,15,NRSV,so he set off and went to his father,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,1
2404,LUK,15,NRSV,but while he was still far off his father saw him and was filled with compassion he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him,when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the body to joseph,1
2405,LUK,15,NRSV,then the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son,saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus,1
2406,LUK,15,NRSV,but the father said to his slaves quickly bring out a robethe best oneand put it on him put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet,then the sixth angel blew his trumpet and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before god saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates,1
2407,LUK,15,NRSV,and get the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to celebrate,the tribune took him by the hand drew him aside privately and asked what is it that you have to report to me,1
2408,LUK,15,NRSV,now his elder son was in the field and when he came and approached the house he heard music and dancing,do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered,1
2409,LUK,15,NRSV,he called one of the slaves and asked what was going on,there he found a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had ordered all jews to leave rome,1
2410,LUK,15,NRSV,he replied your brother has come and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has got him back safe and sound,and whoever does not provide for relatives and especially for family members has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever,1
2411,LUK,15,NRSV,then he became angry and refused to go in,he is the reflection of gods glory and the exact imprint of gods very being and he sustains all things by his powerful word,1
2412,LUK,15,NRSV,his father came out and began to plead with him,and they shall not teach one another or say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest,1
2413,LUK,15,NRSV,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends,by running under the lee of a small island called cauda we were scarcely able to get the ships boat under control,1
2414,LUK,15,NRSV,but when this son of yours came back who has devoured your property with prostitutes you killed the fatted calf for him then the father said to him son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours,is it not the one at the table,1
2415,LUK,15,NRSV,but we had to celebrate and rejoice because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life he was lost and has been found,but you have made it a den of robbers,1
2416,LUK,16,NRSV,then jesus said to the disciples there was a rich man who had a manager and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property,for just as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body though many are one body so it is with christ,1
2417,LUK,16,NRSV,so he summoned him and said to him what is this that i hear about you,the children of god and the children of the devil are revealed in this way all who do not do what is right are not from god nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters,1
2418,LUK,16,NRSV,give me an accounting of your management because you cannot be my manager any longer,we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness,1
2419,LUK,16,NRSV,then the manager said to himself what will i do now that my master is taking the position away from me,you have never heard his voice or seen his form and you do not have his word abiding in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent,1
2420,LUK,16,NRSV,i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him,1
2421,LUK,16,NRSV,i have decided what to do so that when i am dismissed as manager people may welcome me into their homes,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,1
2422,LUK,16,NRSV,so summoning his masters debtors one by one he asked the first how much do you owe my master,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,1
2423,LUK,16,NRSV,he answered a hundred jugs of olive oil,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish,1
2424,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him take your bill sit down quickly and make it fifty,so they proposed two joseph called barsabbas who was also known as justus and matthias,1
2425,LUK,16,NRSV,then he asked another and how much do you owe,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,1
2426,LUK,16,NRSV,he replied a hundred containers of wheat,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done,1
2427,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him take your bill and make it eighty,but because i have said these things to you sorrow has filled your hearts,1
2428,LUK,16,NRSV,and his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light,and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home,1
2429,LUK,16,NRSV,and i tell you make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone they may welcome you into the eternal homes,the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice,1
2430,LUK,16,NRSV,whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much,you are those who have stood by me in my trials and i confer on you just as my father has conferred on me a kingdom so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,1
2431,LUK,16,NRSV,if then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth who will entrust to you the true riches,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you,1
2432,LUK,16,NRSV,and if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another who will give you what is your own,therefore openly before the churches show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you,1
2433,LUK,16,NRSV,no slave can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other,for god has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of god will be fulfilled,1
2434,LUK,16,NRSV,you cannot serve god and wealth,the son of god was revealed for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil,1
2435,LUK,16,NRSV,the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all this and they ridiculed him,do not be deceived bad company ruins good morals,1
2436,LUK,16,NRSV,so he said to them you are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others but god knows your hearts for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of god,the one who testifies to these things says surely i am coming soon,1
2437,LUK,16,NRSV,the law and the prophets were in effect until john came since then the good news of the kingdom of god is proclaimed and everyone tries to enter it by force,do not speak harshly to an older man but speak to him as to a father to younger men as brothers to older women as mothers to younger women as sisterswith absolute purity,1
2438,LUK,16,NRSV,but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped,then they asked him where lord,1
2439,LUK,16,NRSV,anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery,but to the one who had told him this jesus replied who is my mother and who are my brothers,1
2440,LUK,16,NRSV,there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints,1
2441,LUK,16,NRSV,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days,1
2442,LUK,16,NRSV,the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with abraham,and when they had crucified him they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots then they sat down there and kept watch over him,1
2443,LUK,16,NRSV,the rich man also died and was buried,for though i am absent in body yet i am with you in spirit and i rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in christ,1
2444,LUK,16,NRSV,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side,but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation gods own people in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light,1
2445,LUK,16,NRSV,he called out father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in agony in these flames,therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour,1
2446,LUK,16,NRSV,but abraham said child remember that during your lifetime you received your good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony,just then there came a man named jairus a leader of the synagogue,1
2447,LUK,16,NRSV,besides all this between you and us a great chasm has been fixed so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so and no one can cross from there to us,for when the time comes to eat each of you goes ahead with your own supper and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk,1
2448,LUK,16,NRSV,he said then father i beg you to send him to my fathers house for i have five brothersthat he may warn them so that they will not also come into this place of torment,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before,1
2449,LUK,16,NRSV,abraham replied they have moses and the prophets they should listen to them,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish,1
2450,LUK,16,NRSV,he said no father abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent,that slave who knew what his master wanted but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted will receive a severe beating,1
2451,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead,he called the crowd with his disciples and said to them if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me,1
2452,LUK,17,NRSV,jesus said to his disciples occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to anyone by whom they come it would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble,you know that he was revealed to take away sins and in him there is no sin,1
2453,LUK,17,NRSV,be on your guard if another disciple sins you must rebuke the offender and if there is repentance you must forgive,then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law,1
2454,LUK,17,NRSV,and if the same person sins against you seven times a day and turns back to you seven times and says i repent you must forgive,those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed,1
2455,LUK,17,NRSV,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith the lord replied if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you,for this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels,1
2456,LUK,17,NRSV,who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field come here at once and take your place at the table,some fell on the rock and as it grew up it withered for lack of moisture,1
2457,LUK,17,NRSV,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink,but now you must get rid of all such thingsanger wrath malice slander and abusive language from your mouth,1
2458,LUK,17,NRSV,do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded,then when i returned i could have collected it with interest,1
2459,LUK,17,NRSV,so you also when you have done all that you were ordered to do say we are worthless slaves we have done only what we ought to have done on the way to jerusalem jesus was going through the region between samaria and galilee,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,1
2460,LUK,17,NRSV,as he entered a village ten lepers approached him,then jesus said to him put your sword back into its place for all who take the sword will perish by the sword,1
2461,LUK,17,NRSV,keeping their distance they called out saying jesus master have mercy on us when he saw them he said to them go and show yourselves to the priests,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem,1
2462,LUK,17,NRSV,and as they went they were made clean,you know that he was revealed to take away sins and in him there is no sin,1
2463,LUK,17,NRSV,then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising god with a loud voice,martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days,1
2464,LUK,17,NRSV,he prostrated himself at jesus feet and thanked him,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,1
2465,LUK,17,NRSV,then jesus asked were not ten made clean,for many times it had seized him he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds jesus then asked him what is your name,1
2466,LUK,17,NRSV,but the other nine where are they,their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural and in the same way also the men giving up natural intercourse with women were consumed with passion for one another,1
2467,LUK,17,NRSV,was none of them found to return and give praise to god except this foreigner,jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has saved you,1
2468,LUK,17,NRSV,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well,so the crowd that had been with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify,1
2469,LUK,17,NRSV,once jesus was asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god was coming and he answered the kingdom of god is not coming with things that can be observed nor will they say look here it is or there it is for in fact the kingdom of god is among you,do we not have the right to our food and drink,1
2470,LUK,17,NRSV,then he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man and you will not see it,a number of those who practiced magic collected their books and burned them publicly when the value of these books was calculated it was found to come to fifty thousand silver coins,1
2471,LUK,17,NRSV,they will say to you look there or look here do not go do not set off in pursuit,they said is not this josephs son,1
2472,LUK,17,NRSV,for as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other so will the son of man be in his day,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,1
2473,LUK,17,NRSV,but first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband,1
2474,LUK,17,NRSV,just as it was in the days of noah so too it will be in the days of the son of man,if i speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels but do not have love i am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal,1
2475,LUK,17,NRSV,they were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed all of them,so do not let your good be spoken of as evil,1
2476,LUK,17,NRSV,likewise just as it was in the days of lot they were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building but on the day that lot left sodom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them it will be like that on the day that the son of man is revealed,yet if any of you suffers as a christian do not consider it a disgrace but glorify god because you bear this name,1
2477,LUK,17,NRSV,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back,then philip began to speak and starting with this scripture he proclaimed to him the good news about jesus,1
2478,LUK,17,NRSV,those who try to make their life secure will lose it but those who lose their life will keep it,to everyone who conquers i will give some of the hidden manna and i will give a white stone and on the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it,1
2479,LUK,17,NRSV,i tell you on that night there will be two in one bed one will be taken and the other left,for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness,1
2480,LUK,17,NRSV,there will be two women grinding meal together one will be taken and the other left,by faith abraham when put to the test offered up isaac,1
2481,LUK,17,NRSV,then they asked him where lord,the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all this and they ridiculed him,1
2482,LUK,17,NRSV,he said to them where the corpse is there the vultures will gather,when they persecute you in one town flee to the next for truly i tell you you will not have gone through all the towns of israel before the son of man comes,1
2483,LUK,18,NRSV,then jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment,1
2484,LUK,18,NRSV,he said in a certain city there was a judge who neither feared god nor had respect for people,then he shouted jesus son of david have mercy on me those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet but he shouted even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him and when he came near he asked him what do you want me to do for you,1
2485,LUK,18,NRSV,in that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying grant me justice against my opponent,but thomas who was called the twin one of the twelve was not with them when jesus came,1
2486,LUK,18,NRSV,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming,there were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting,1
2487,LUK,18,NRSV,and the lord said listen to what the unjust judge says,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god,1
2488,LUK,18,NRSV,and will not god grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night,did i take advantage of you through any of those whom i sent to you,1
2489,LUK,18,NRSV,will he delay long in helping them,but to which of the angels has he ever said sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet,1
2490,LUK,18,NRSV,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them,and he invited philip to get in and sit beside him,1
2491,LUK,18,NRSV,and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified,1
2492,LUK,18,NRSV,he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector,as for titus he is my partner and coworker in your service as for our brothers they are messengers of the churches the glory of christ,1
2493,LUK,18,NRSV,the pharisee standing by himself was praying thus god i thank you that i am not like other people thieves rogues adulterers or even like this tax collector,then festus gave the order and paul was brought in,1
2494,LUK,18,NRSV,i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing,1
2495,LUK,18,NRSV,but the tax collector standing far off would not even look up to heaven but was beating his breast and saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his home justified rather than the other for all who exalt themselves will be humbled but all who humble themselves will be exalted,a man was there named zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was rich,1
2496,LUK,18,NRSV,people were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them and when the disciples saw it they sternly ordered them not to do it,avoid them for among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth,1
2497,LUK,18,NRSV,but jesus called for them and said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,1
2498,LUK,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,when we cry abba father it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him,1
2499,LUK,18,NRSV,a certain ruler asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life,then some people came bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four of them,1
2500,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good,the jailer called for lights and rushing in he fell down trembling before paul and silas,1
2501,LUK,18,NRSV,no one is good but god alone,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,1
2502,LUK,18,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother,the faith that you have have as your own conviction before god,1
2503,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied i have kept all these since my youth,it is even more obvious when another priest arises resembling melchizedek one who has become a priest not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life,1
2504,LUK,18,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to him there is still one thing lacking,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives,1
2505,LUK,18,NRSV,sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me,rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you,1
2506,LUK,18,NRSV,but when he heard this he became sad for he was very rich,very truly i tell you anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit,1
2507,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children,1
2508,LUK,18,NRSV,those who heard it said then who can be saved,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him,1
2509,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied what is impossible for mortals is possible for god,if this man were not from god he could do nothing,1
2510,LUK,18,NRSV,then peter said look we have left our homes and followed you,and he took them up in his arms laid his hands on them and blessed them,1
2511,LUK,18,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god who will not get back very much more in this age and in the age to come eternal life,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,1
2512,LUK,18,NRSV,then he took the twelve aside and said to them see we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written about the son of man by the prophets will be accomplished,but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk,1
2513,LUK,18,NRSV,for he will be handed over to the gentiles and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon,when they heard this they were enraged and shouted great is artemis of the ephesians the city was filled with the confusion and people rushed together to the theater dragging with them gaius and aristarchus macedonians who were pauls travel companions,1
2514,LUK,18,NRSV,after they have flogged him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables,1
2515,LUK,18,NRSV,but they understood nothing about all these things in fact what he said was hidden from them and they did not grasp what was said,but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me also so that i would not have one sorrow after another,1
2516,LUK,18,NRSV,as he approached jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging,they should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them anointing them with oil in the name of the lord,1
2517,LUK,18,NRSV,when he heard a crowd going by he asked what was happening,by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin,1
2518,LUK,18,NRSV,they told him jesus of nazareth is passing by,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,1
2519,LUK,18,NRSV,then he shouted jesus son of david have mercy on me those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet but he shouted even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him and when he came near he asked him what do you want me to do for you,woe to you when all speak well of you for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets,1
2520,LUK,18,NRSV,he said lord let me see again,for a bishop as gods steward must be blameless he must not be arrogant or quicktempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain but he must be hospitable a lover of goodness prudent upright devout and selfcontrolled,1
2521,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has saved you,yet those who marry will experience distress in this life and i would spare you that,1
2522,LUK,18,NRSV,immediately he regained his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it praised god,one day while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting near by they had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal,1
2523,LUK,19,NRSV,he entered jericho and was passing through it,as it is written for your sake we are being killed all day long we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered,1
2524,LUK,19,NRSV,a man was there named zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was rich,and as he talked with him he went in and found that many had assembled and he said to them you yourselves know that it is unlawful for a jew to associate with or to visit a gentile but god has shown me that i should not call anyone profane or unclean,1
2525,LUK,19,NRSV,he was trying to see who jesus was but on account of the crowd he could not because he was short in stature,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there they departed,1
2526,LUK,19,NRSV,so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him because he was going to pass that way,what i have forgiven if i have forgiven anything has been for your sake in the presence of christ,1
2527,LUK,19,NRSV,when jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him zacchaeus hurry and come down for i must stay at your house today,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,1
2528,LUK,19,NRSV,so he hurried down and was happy to welcome him,at that very hour some pharisees came and said to him get away from here for herod wants to kill you,1
2529,LUK,19,NRSV,all who saw it began to grumble and said he has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,1
2530,LUK,19,NRSV,zacchaeus stood there and said to the lord look half of my possessions lord i will give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i will pay back four times as much,did not moses give you the law,1
2531,LUK,19,NRSV,then jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham,for there is no distinction since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god they are now justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood effective through faith,1
2532,LUK,19,NRSV,for the son of man came to seek out and to save the lost,now brothers and sisters you know that members of the household of stephanas were the first converts in achaia and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints i urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people and of everyone who works and toils with them,1
2533,LUK,19,NRSV,as they were listening to this he went on to tell a parable because he was near jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of god was to appear immediately,come see the place where he lay,1
2534,LUK,19,NRSV,so he said a nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return,for this ointment could have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor,1
2535,LUK,19,NRSV,he summoned ten of his slaves and gave them ten pounds and said to them do business with these until i come back,then the angel departed from her,1
2536,LUK,19,NRSV,but the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him saying we do not want this man to rule over us,let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured,1
2537,LUK,19,NRSV,when he returned having received royal power he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,1
2538,LUK,19,NRSV,the first came forward and said lord your pound has made ten more pounds,i therefore the prisoner in the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,1
2539,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him well done good slave because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing take charge of ten cities,reach out your hand and put it in my side,1
2540,LUK,19,NRSV,then the second came saying lord your pound has made five pounds,will what is molded say to the one who molds it why have you made me like this,1
2541,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him and you rule over five cities,they ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full,1
2542,LUK,19,NRSV,then the other came saying lord here is your pound,a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me,1
2543,LUK,19,NRSV,i wrapped it up in a piece of cloth for i was afraid of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow,for if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say have a seat here please while to the one who is poor you say stand there or sit at my feet have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts,1
2544,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him i will judge you by your own words you wicked slave you knew did you that i was a harsh man taking what i did not deposit and reaping what i did not sow,by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure,1
2545,LUK,19,NRSV,why then did you not put my money into the bank,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest heaven and on earth peace among those whom he favors when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another let us go now to bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place which the lord has made known to us,1
2546,LUK,19,NRSV,then when i returned i could have collected it with interest,crispus the official of the synagogue became a believer in the lord together with all his household and many of the corinthians who heard paul became believers and were baptized,1
2547,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with them those who are being tortured as though you yourselves were being tortured,1
2548,LUK,19,NRSV,and they said to him lord he has ten pounds i tell you to all those who have more will be given but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,from there they sailed back to antioch where they had been commended to the grace of god for the work that they had completed,1
2549,LUK,19,NRSV,but as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here and slaughter them in my presence,for god has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our lord jesus christ who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him,1
2550,LUK,19,NRSV,after he had said this he went on ahead going up to jerusalem,when she had said this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not know that it was jesus,1
2551,LUK,19,NRSV,when he had come near bethphage and bethany at the place called the mount of olives he sent two of the disciples saying go into the village ahead of you and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden,should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound,1
2552,LUK,19,NRSV,untie it and bring it here,for i fear that when i come i may find you not as i wish and that you may find me not as you wish i fear that there may perhaps be quarreling jealousy anger selfishness slander gossip conceit and disorder,1
2553,LUK,19,NRSV,if anyone asks you why are you untying it,when they say there is peace and security then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman and there will be no escape but you beloved are not in darkness for that day to surprise you like a thief for you are all children of light and children of the day we are not of the night or of darkness,1
2554,LUK,19,NRSV,just say this the lord needs it,but it is god who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts as a first installment,1
2555,LUK,19,NRSV,so those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them,we must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did and twentythree thousand fell in a single day,1
2556,LUK,19,NRSV,as they were untying the colt its owners asked them why are you untying the colt,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying god forbid it lord this must never happen to you,1
2557,LUK,19,NRSV,they said the lord needs it,but you have made it a den of robbers,1
2558,LUK,19,NRSV,then they brought it to jesus and after throwing their cloaks on the colt they set jesus on it,i know them and they follow me,1
2559,LUK,19,NRSV,as he rode along people kept spreading their cloaks on the road,but jesus aware of their malice said why are you putting me to the test you hypocrites,1
2560,LUK,19,NRSV,as he was now approaching the path down from the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise god joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen saying blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven some of the pharisees in the crowd said to him teacher order your disciples to stop,the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well,1
2561,LUK,19,NRSV,he answered i tell you if these were silent the stones would shout out,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,1
2562,LUK,19,NRSV,as he came near and saw the city he wept over it saying if you even you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace but now they are hidden from your eyes,by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to blaspheme and since i was so furiously enraged at them i pursued them even to foreign cities,1
2563,LUK,19,NRSV,indeed the days will come upon you when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you and hem you in on every side,when i was informed that there would be a plot against the man i sent him to you at once ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him,1
2564,LUK,19,NRSV,they will crush you to the ground you and your children within you and they will not leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from god,i know that you cannot tolerate evildoers you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them to be false,1
2565,LUK,19,NRSV,then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there and he said it is written my house shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints,1
2566,LUK,19,NRSV,every day he was teaching in the temple,but we pray to god that you may not do anything wrongnot that we may appear to have met the test but that you may do what is right though we may seem to have failed,1
2567,LUK,19,NRSV,the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were spellbound by what they heard,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,1
2568,LUK,20,NRSV,one day as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders and said to him tell us by what authority are you doing these things,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring,1
2569,LUK,20,NRSV,who is it who gave you this authority,he stretched out his hand and touched him saying i do choose,1
2570,LUK,20,NRSV,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord,1
2571,LUK,20,NRSV,they discussed it with one another saying if we say from heaven he will say why did you not believe him,on recognizing peters voice she was so overjoyed that instead of opening the gate she ran in and announced that peter was standing at the gate,1
2572,LUK,20,NRSV,but if we say of human origin all the people will stone us for they are convinced that john was a prophet,for the lords sake accept the authority of every human institution whether of the emperor as supreme or of governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right,1
2573,LUK,20,NRSV,so they answered that they did not know where it came from,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross,1
2574,LUK,20,NRSV,then jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard,1
2575,LUK,20,NRSV,he began to tell the people this parable a man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants and went to another country for a long time,i pray therefore that you may not lose heart over my sufferings for you they are your glory,1
2576,LUK,20,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard but the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,for who can resist his will,1
2577,LUK,20,NRSV,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded,and alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people,1
2578,LUK,20,NRSV,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,has not god chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him,1
2579,LUK,20,NRSV,then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1
2580,LUK,20,NRSV,i will send my beloved son perhaps they will respect him,for if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree,1
2581,LUK,20,NRSV,but when the tenants saw him they discussed it among themselves and said this is the heir let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours,wives in the same way accept the authority of your husbands so that even if some of them do not obey the word they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct when they see the purity and reverence of your lives,1
2582,LUK,20,NRSV,so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,all things are lawful for me but not all things are beneficial,1
2583,LUK,20,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,1
2584,LUK,20,NRSV,he will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments,1
2585,LUK,20,NRSV,when they heard this they said heaven forbid but he looked at them and said what then does this text mean the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,but to the rest of you in thyatira who do not hold this teaching who have not learned what some call the deep things of satan to you i say i do not lay on you any other burden only hold fast to what you have until i come,1
2586,LUK,20,NRSV,everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces and it will crush anyone on whom it falls,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,1
2587,LUK,20,NRSV,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,the fruit for which your soul longed has gone from you and all your dainties and your splendor are lost to you never to be found again the merchants of these wares who gained wealth from her will stand far off in fear of her torment weeping and mourning aloud alas alas the great city clothed in fine linen in purple and scarlet adorned with gold with jewels and with pearls for in one hour all this wealth has been laid waste and all shipmasters and seafarers sailors and all whose trade is on the sea stood far off and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning what city was like the great city,1
2588,LUK,20,NRSV,so they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest in order to trap him by what he said so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor,for i fear that when i come i may find you not as i wish and that you may find me not as you wish i fear that there may perhaps be quarreling jealousy anger selfishness slander gossip conceit and disorder,1
2589,LUK,20,NRSV,so they asked him teacher we know that you are right in what you say and teach and you show deference to no one but teach the way of god in accordance with truth,so philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet isaiah,1
2590,LUK,20,NRSV,is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,1
2591,LUK,20,NRSV,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them show me a denarius,and the dead were judged according to their works as recorded in the books,1
2592,LUK,20,NRSV,whose head and whose title does it bear,immediately they left their nets and followed him,1
2593,LUK,20,NRSV,he said to them then give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods,on hearing this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus,1
2594,LUK,20,NRSV,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,therefore i urge you to take some food for it will help you survive for none of you will lose a hair from your heads,1
2595,LUK,20,NRSV,some sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no children the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother, so the pharisees and the scribes asked him why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders but eat with defiled hands,1
2596,LUK,20,NRSV,now there were seven brothers the first married and died childless then the second and the third married her and so in the same way all seven died childless,if any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you as you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them,1
2597,LUK,20,NRSV,in the resurrection therefore whose wife will the woman be,or what will they give in return for their life,1
2598,LUK,20,NRSV,for the seven had married her,paul said i am appealing to the emperors tribunal this is where i should be tried,1
2599,LUK,20,NRSV,jesus said to them those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,but if you show partiality you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors,1
2600,LUK,20,NRSV,indeed they cannot die anymore because they are like angels and are children of god being children of the resurrection,grace be with all of you,1
2601,LUK,20,NRSV,and the fact that the dead are raised moses himself showed in the story about the bush where he speaks of the lord as the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,they went to him and woke him up shouting master master we are perishing and he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves they ceased and there was a calm,1
2602,LUK,20,NRSV,now he is god not of the dead but of the living for to him all of them are alive,when jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be made well,1
2603,LUK,20,NRSV,then some of the scribes answered teacher you have spoken well,paul replied i am a jew from tarsus in cilicia a citizen of an important city i beg you let me speak to the people,1
2604,LUK,20,NRSV,for they no longer dared to ask him another question,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1
2605,LUK,20,NRSV,then he said to them how can they say that the messiah is davids son,you are those who have stood by me in my trials and i confer on you just as my father has conferred on me a kingdom so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,1
2606,LUK,20,NRSV,for david himself says in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool,again i ask did israel not understand,1
2607,LUK,20,NRSV,david thus calls him lord so how can he be his son,then each one will receive commendation from god,1
2608,LUK,20,NRSV,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,so then brothers and sisters stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us either by word of mouth or by our letter,1
2609,LUK,20,NRSV,they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened,1
2610,LUK,20,NRSV,they will receive the greater condemnation,then they tried to arrest him again but he escaped from their hands,1
2611,LUK,21,NRSV,he looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the treasury he also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday,1
2612,LUK,21,NRSV,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,obey your leaders and submit to them for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account,1
2613,LUK,21,NRSV,when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to god he said as for these things that you see the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another all will be thrown down,ananias peter asked why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land,1
2614,LUK,21,NRSV,they asked him teacher when will this be and what will be the sign that this is about to take place,now this was the second sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee,1
2615,LUK,21,NRSV,and he said beware that you are not led astray for many will come in my name and say i am he and the time is near do not go after them,even now you are still not ready for you are still of the flesh,1
2616,LUK,21,NRSV,when you hear of wars and insurrections do not be terrified for these things must take place first but the end will not follow immediately,when they had entered the city they went to the room upstairs where they were staying peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas son of james,1
2617,LUK,21,NRSV,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven,nevertheless on some points i have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder because of the grace given me by god to be a minister of christ jesus to the gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of god so that the offering of the gentiles may be acceptable sanctified by the holy spirit,1
2618,LUK,21,NRSV,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name,rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you,1
2619,LUK,21,NRSV,this will give you an opportunity to testify,i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to them god will add to that person the plagues described in this book if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy god will take away that persons share in the tree of life and in the holy city which are described in this book,1
2620,LUK,21,NRSV,so make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance for i will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,1
2621,LUK,21,NRSV,you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers by relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,1
2622,LUK,21,NRSV,you will be hated by all because of my name,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,1
2623,LUK,21,NRSV,but not a hair of your head will perish,what do you have that you did not receive,1
2624,LUK,21,NRSV,by your endurance you will gain your souls,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe youyou of little faith,1
2625,LUK,21,NRSV,when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near,then the king will say to those at his right hand come you that are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you welcomed me i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you took care of me i was in prison and you visited me,1
2626,LUK,21,NRSV,then those in judea must flee to the mountains and those inside the city must leave it and those out in the country must not enter it for these are days of vengeance as a fulfillment of all that is written,the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were spellbound by what they heard,1
2627,LUK,21,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days for there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations and jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled,he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up,1
2628,LUK,21,NRSV,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,1
2629,LUK,21,NRSV,people will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world for the powers of the heavens will be shaken,peter looked intently at him as did john and said look at us,1
2630,LUK,21,NRSV,then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory,for the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born,1
2631,LUK,21,NRSV,now when these things begin to take place stand up and raise your heads because your redemption is drawing near,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone,1
2632,LUK,21,NRSV,then he told them a parable look at the fig tree and all the trees as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near,but those who have doubts are condemned if they eat because they do not act from faith for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin,1
2633,LUK,21,NRSV,so also when you see these things taking place you know that the kingdom of god is near,for who can resist his will,1
2634,LUK,21,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place,then he said into what then were you baptized,1
2635,LUK,21,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,all the jews know my way of life from my youth a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in jerusalem,1
2636,LUK,21,NRSV,be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life and that day catch you unexpectedly like a trap,and as he sat at dinner in the house many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples,1
2637,LUK,21,NRSV,for it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants the prophets,1
2638,LUK,21,NRSV,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,1
2639,LUK,21,NRSV,every day he was teaching in the temple and at night he would go out and spend the night on the mount of olives as it was called,they came to john and said to him rabbi the one who was with you across the jordan to whom you testified here he is baptizing and all are going to him,1
2640,LUK,21,NRSV,and all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple,whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me,1
2641,LUK,22,NRSV,now the festival of unleavened bread which is called the passover was near,the young men came and wrapped up his body then carried him out and buried him,1
2642,LUK,22,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put jesus to death for they were afraid of the people,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me,1
2643,LUK,22,NRSV,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them,only live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come and see you or am absent and hear about you i will know that you are standing firm in one spirit striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel and are in no way intimidated by your opponents,1
2644,LUK,22,NRSV,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him,1
2645,LUK,22,NRSV,so he consented and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present,one sabbath while jesus was going through the grainfields his disciples plucked some heads of grain rubbed them in their hands and ate them,1
2646,LUK,22,NRSV,then came the day of unleavened bread on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed,from that time jesus began to proclaim repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near,1
2647,LUK,22,NRSV,so jesus sent peter and john saying go and prepare the passover meal for us that we may eat it,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves,1
2648,LUK,22,NRSV,they asked him where do you want us to make preparations for it,if david thus calls him lord how can he be his son,1
2649,LUK,22,NRSV,listen he said to them when you have entered the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him into the house he enters and say to the owner of the house the teacher asks you where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,1
2650,LUK,22,NRSV,he will show you a large room upstairs already furnished,agrippa said to festus i would like to hear the man myself,1
2651,LUK,22,NRSV,so they went and found everything as he had told them and they prepared the passover meal,he said i do not know,1
2652,LUK,22,NRSV,when the hour came he took his place at the table and the apostles with him,for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church,1
2653,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i tell you i will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god,see how many charges they bring against you,1
2654,LUK,22,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he said take this and divide it among yourselves for i tell you that from now on i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you,1
2655,LUK,22,NRSV,then he took a loaf of bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body which is given for you,if i partake with thankfulness why should i be denounced because of that for which i give thanks,1
2656,LUK,22,NRSV,do this in remembrance of me,which of you convicts me of sin,1
2657,LUK,22,NRSV,and he did the same with the cup after supper saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,1
2658,LUK,22,NRSV,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,1
2659,LUK,22,NRSV,for the son of man is going as it has been determined but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children,1
2660,LUK,22,NRSV,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest,what then are we to say,1
2661,LUK,22,NRSV,but he said to them the kings of the gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors,i will therefore have him flogged and release him,1
2662,LUK,22,NRSV,but not so with you rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest and the leader like one who serves,for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad,1
2663,LUK,22,NRSV,for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,1
2664,LUK,22,NRSV,is it not the one at the table,then we went on board the ship and they returned home,1
2665,LUK,22,NRSV,but i am among you as one who serves,they have stumbled over the stumbling stone as it is written see i am laying in zion a stone that will make people stumble a rock that will make them fall and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame,1
2666,LUK,22,NRSV,you are those who have stood by me in my trials and i confer on you just as my father has conferred on me a kingdom so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,pilate replied i am not a jew am i,1
2667,LUK,22,NRSV,simon simon listen satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat but i have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail and you when once you have turned back strengthen your brothers,for i will be merciful toward their iniquities and i will remember their sins no more,1
2668,LUK,22,NRSV,and he said to him lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death jesus said i tell you peter the cock will not crow this day until you have denied three times that you know me,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish,1
2669,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them when i sent you out without a purse bag or sandals did you lack anything,and they said to him seven,1
2670,LUK,22,NRSV,they said no not a thing,but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and he protected him,1
2671,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them but now the one who has a purse must take it and likewise a bag,greet andronicus and junia my relatives who were in prison with me they are prominent among the apostles and they were in christ before i was,1
2672,LUK,22,NRSV,and the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right,1
2673,LUK,22,NRSV,for i tell you this scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was counted among the lawless and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled,if i have told you about earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if i tell you about heavenly things,1
2674,LUK,22,NRSV,they said lord look here are two swords,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly,1
2675,LUK,22,NRSV,he came out and went as was his custom to the mount of olives and the disciples followed him,at once jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves and he said to them why do you raise such questions in your hearts,1
2676,LUK,22,NRSV,when he reached the place he said to them pray that you may not come into the time of trial,but a man named ananias with the consent of his wife sapphira sold a piece of property with his wifes knowledge he kept back some of the proceeds and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet,1
2677,LUK,22,NRSV,then he withdrew from them about a stones throw knelt down and prayed father if you are willing remove this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done,so also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great exploits,1
2678,LUK,22,NRSV, then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength,the god of this people israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of egypt and with uplifted arm he led them out of it,1
2679,LUK,22,NRSV,in his anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground when he got up from prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief and he said to them why are you sleeping,and he invited philip to get in and sit beside him,1
2680,LUK,22,NRSV,get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial,and a woman in the city who was a sinner having learned that he was eating in the pharisees house brought an alabaster jar of ointment,1
2681,LUK,22,NRSV,while he was still speaking suddenly a crowd came and the one called judas one of the twelve was leading them,bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse them,1
2682,LUK,22,NRSV,he approached jesus to kiss him but jesus said to him judas is it with a kiss that you are betraying the son of man,what then are we to say,1
2683,LUK,22,NRSV,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life,1
2684,LUK,22,NRSV,then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear,you are witnesses and god also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was toward you believers,1
2685,LUK,22,NRSV,but jesus said no more of this and he touched his ear and healed him,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law,1
2686,LUK,22,NRSV,then jesus said to the chief priests the officers of the temple police and the elders who had come for him have you come out with swords and clubs as if i were a bandit,the voice said to him again a second time what god has made clean you must not call profane,1
2687,LUK,22,NRSV,when i was with you day after day in the temple you did not lay hands on me,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,1
2688,LUK,22,NRSV,but this is your hour and the power of darkness then they seized him and led him away bringing him into the high priests house,the official said to him sir come down before my little boy dies,1
2689,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter was following at a distance,the good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks,1
2690,LUK,22,NRSV,when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together peter sat among them,we sailed from there and on the following day we arrived opposite chios,1
2691,LUK,22,NRSV,then a servantgirl seeing him in the firelight stared at him and said this man also was with him,if you do these things show yourself to the world,1
2692,LUK,22,NRSV,but he denied it saying woman i do not know him,do not presume to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,1
2693,LUK,22,NRSV,a little later someone else on seeing him said you also are one of them,for we were not overstepping our limits when we reached you we were the first to come all the way to you with the good news of christ,1
2694,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter said man i am not then about an hour later still another kept insisting surely this man also was with him for he is a galilean,whose head and whose title does it bear,1
2695,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter said man i do not know what you are talking about at that moment while he was still speaking the cock crowed,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth,1
2696,LUK,22,NRSV,the lord turned and looked at peter,for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god,1
2697,LUK,22,NRSV,then peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said to him before the cock crows today you will deny me three times,i write to you young people because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the evil one,1
2698,LUK,22,NRSV,and he went out and wept bitterly,but if i have spoken rightly why do you strike me,1
2699,LUK,22,NRSV,now the men who were holding jesus began to mock him and beat him they also blindfolded him and kept asking him prophesy who is it that struck you,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,1
2700,LUK,22,NRSV,they kept heaping many other insults on him,as the people were filled with expectation and all were questioning in their hearts concerning john whether he might be the messiah john answered all of them by saying i baptize you with water but one who is more powerful than i is coming i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals,1
2701,LUK,22,NRSV,when day came the assembly of the elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they brought him to their council,then joseph bought a linen cloth and taking down the body wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock,1
2702,LUK,22,NRSV,they said if you are the messiah tell us,peter said lord are you telling this parable for us or for everyone,1
2703,LUK,22,NRSV,he replied if i tell you you will not believe and if i question you you will not answer,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,1
2704,LUK,22,NRSV,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god,they said to her none of your relatives has this name,1
2705,LUK,22,NRSV,all of them asked are you then the son of god,as i looked at it closely i saw fourfooted animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air,1
2706,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them you say that i am,let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god comes on those who are disobedient,1
2707,LUK,22,NRSV,then they said what further testimony do we need,i will lay down my life for you,1
2708,LUK,22,NRSV,we have heard it ourselves from his own lips,why then did you not put my money into the bank,1
2709,LUK,23,NRSV,then the assembly rose as a body and brought jesus before pilate,i am a debtor both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish hence my eagerness to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in rome,1
2710,LUK,23,NRSV,they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor and saying that he himself is the messiah a king,the apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter,1
2711,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,1
2712,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds i find no basis for an accusation against this man,so he himself believed along with his whole household,1
2713,LUK,23,NRSV,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place,and they answered him john the baptist and others elijah and still others one of the prophets,1
2714,LUK,23,NRSV,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean,just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if it were a matter of crime or serious villainy i would be justified in accepting the complaint of you jews but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters,1
2715,LUK,23,NRSV,and when he learned that he was under herods jurisdiction he sent him off to herod who was himself in jerusalem at that time,when he arrived the jews who had gone down from jerusalem surrounded him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove,1
2716,LUK,23,NRSV,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign,apart from the law sin lies dead,1
2717,LUK,23,NRSV,he questioned him at some length but jesus gave him no answer,the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus,1
2718,LUK,23,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him,after we had reached safety we then learned that the island was called malta,1
2719,LUK,23,NRSV,even herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him then he put an elegant robe on him and sent him back to pilate,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses,1
2720,LUK,23,NRSV,that same day herod and pilate became friends with each other before this they had been enemies,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught,1
2721,LUK,23,NRSV,pilate then called together the chief priests the leaders and the people and said to them you brought me this man as one who was perverting the people and here i have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him,every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit,1
2722,LUK,23,NRSV,neither has herod for he sent him back to us,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words,1
2723,LUK,23,NRSV,indeed he has done nothing to deserve death,he asked do you understand what you are reading,1
2724,LUK,23,NRSV,i will therefore have him flogged and release him,but they did not understand what he said to them,1
2725,LUK,23,NRSV,then they all shouted out together away with this fellow release barabbas for us this was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city and for murder pilate wanting to release jesus addressed them again but they kept shouting crucify crucify him a third time he said to them why what evil has he done,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1
2726,LUK,23,NRSV,i have found in him no ground for the sentence of death i will therefore have him flogged and then release him,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us,1
2727,LUK,23,NRSV,but they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified and their voices prevailed,put things in order listen to my appeal agree with one another live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you,1
2728,LUK,23,NRSV,so pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted,he is god not of the dead but of the living,1
2729,LUK,23,NRSV,he released the man they asked for the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder and he handed jesus over as they wished,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,1
2730,LUK,23,NRSV,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,those who conquer will inherit these things and i will be their god and they will be my children,1
2731,LUK,23,NRSV,a great number of the people followed him and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him,live as children of light for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true,1
2732,LUK,23,NRSV,but jesus turned to them and said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,but i have this against you you tolerate that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophet and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice fornication and to eat food sacrificed to idols,1
2733,LUK,23,NRSV,for the days are surely coming when they will say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed,a jar full of sour wine was standing there,1
2734,LUK,23,NRSV,then they will begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us,if you do these things show yourself to the world,1
2735,LUK,23,NRSV,for if they do this when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry,he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy,1
2736,LUK,23,NRSV,two others also who were criminals were led away to be put to death with him,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building,1
2737,LUK,23,NRSV,when they came to the place that is called the skull they crucified jesus there with the criminals one on his right and one on his left,therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will wear,1
2738,LUK,23,NRSV, then jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they cast lots to divide his clothing,so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit,1
2739,LUK,23,NRSV,and the people stood by watching but the leaders scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the messiah of god his chosen one the soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself there was also an inscription over him this is the king of the jews,his divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness,1
2740,LUK,23,NRSV,one of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying are you not the messiah,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,1
2741,LUK,23,NRSV,save yourself and us but the other rebuked him saying do you not fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation,if we are being afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation if we are being consoled it is for your consolation which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering,1
2742,LUK,23,NRSV,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question saying teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no child the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
2743,LUK,23,NRSV,then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom,embarking on a ship of adramyttium that was about to set sail to the ports along the coast of asia we put to sea accompanied by aristarchus a macedonian from thessalonica,1
2744,LUK,23,NRSV,he replied truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying,1
2745,LUK,23,NRSV,it was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon while the suns light failed and the curtain of the temple was torn in two,he sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone saying the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,1
2746,LUK,23,NRSV,then jesus crying with a loud voice said father into your hands i commend my spirit,moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath,1
2747,LUK,23,NRSV,having said this he breathed his last,then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them mastered them all and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded,1
2748,LUK,23,NRSV,when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised god and said certainly this man was innocent,for three months he was brought up in his fathers house and when he was abandoned pharaohs daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son,1
2749,LUK,23,NRSV,and when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place they returned home beating their breasts,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,1
2750,LUK,23,NRSV,but all his acquaintances including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things,they were expecting him to swell up or drop dead but after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing unusual had happened to him they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god,1
2751,LUK,23,NRSV,now there was a good and righteous man named joseph who though a member of the council had not agreed to their plan and action,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah remains forever,1
2752,LUK,23,NRSV,he came from the jewish town of arimathea and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god,but judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor,1
2753,LUK,23,NRSV,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent even though he sought the blessing with tears,1
2754,LUK,23,NRSV,then he took it down wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a rockhewn tomb where no one had ever been laid,now they know that everything you have given me is from you for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me,1
2755,LUK,23,NRSV,it was the day of preparation and the sabbath was beginning,when they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue he saw a commotion people weeping and wailing loudly,1
2756,LUK,23,NRSV,the women who had come with him from galilee followed and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid,but you have made it a den of robbers,1
2757,LUK,23,NRSV,then they returned and prepared spices and ointments,a certain young man was following him wearing nothing but a linen cloth,1
2758,LUK,23,NRSV,on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them show me a denarius,1
2759,LUK,24,NRSV,but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb taking the spices that they had prepared,but if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not be boastful and false to the truth,1
2760,LUK,24,NRSV,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him,1
2761,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were perplexed about this suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,1
2762,LUK,24,NRSV,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,i will make those of the synagogue of satan who say that they are jews and are not but are lyingi will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that i have loved you,1
2763,LUK,24,NRSV,he is not here but has risen,but a second time the voice answered from heaven what god has made clean you must not call profane,1
2764,LUK,24,NRSV,remember how he told you while he was still in galilee that the son of man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified and on the third day rise again,but jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but for god all things are possible,1
2765,LUK,24,NRSV,then they remembered his words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest,when they had come near jerusalem and had reached bethphage at the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples saying to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me,1
2766,LUK,24,NRSV,now it was mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the other women with them who told this to the apostles,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him,1
2767,LUK,24,NRSV,but these words seemed to them an idle tale and they did not believe them,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,1
2768,LUK,24,NRSV,but peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves then he went home amazed at what had happened,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water,1
2769,LUK,24,NRSV,now on that same day two of them were going to a village called emmaus about seven miles from jerusalem and talking with each other about all these things that had happened,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1
2770,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy,1
2771,LUK,24,NRSV,and he said to them what are you discussing with each other while you walk along,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals,1
2772,LUK,24,NRSV,then one of them whose name was cleopas answered him are you the only stranger in jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,1
2773,LUK,24,NRSV,they replied the things about jesus of nazareth who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him,he approached jesus to kiss him but jesus said to him judas is it with a kiss that you are betraying the son of man,1
2774,LUK,24,NRSV,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel,you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers by relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death,1
2775,LUK,24,NRSV,yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things took place,and i saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened,1
2776,LUK,24,NRSV,moreover some women of our group astounded us,some of the pharisees near him heard this and said to him surely we are not blind are we,1
2777,LUK,24,NRSV,they were at the tomb early this morning and when they did not find his body there they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,1
2778,LUK,24,NRSV,some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,1
2779,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them oh how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared was it not necessary that the messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory,for such boasters are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ,1
2780,LUK,24,NRSV,then beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures,where o death is your sting,1
2781,LUK,24,NRSV,as they came near the village to which they were going he walked ahead as if he were going on,then they led him away to crucify him,1
2782,LUK,24,NRSV,but they urged him strongly saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over,joseph also went from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to the city of david called bethlehem because he was descended from the house and family of david,1
2783,LUK,24,NRSV,so he went in to stay with them,so jesus asked the twelve do you also wish to go away,1
2784,LUK,24,NRSV,when he was at the table with them he took bread blessed and broke it and gave it to them,they seized him shouting fellow israelites help this is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people our law and this place more than that he has actually brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place,1
2785,LUK,24,NRSV,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this,1
2786,LUK,24,NRSV,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him,1
2787,LUK,24,NRSV,that same hour they got up and returned to jerusalem and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on,1
2788,LUK,24,NRSV,they were saying the lord has risen indeed and he has appeared to simon then they told what had happened on the road and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread,then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1
2789,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you,i told them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge,1
2790,LUK,24,NRSV,they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you,1
2791,LUK,24,NRSV,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts,the works that i do in my fathers name testify to me but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep,1
2792,LUK,24,NRSV,look at my hands and my feet see that it is i myself,as it is written he scatters abroad he gives to the poor his righteousness endures forever,1
2793,LUK,24,NRSV,touch me and see for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,1
2794,LUK,24,NRSV,and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses,1
2795,LUK,24,NRSV,while in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering he said to them have you anything here to eat,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy,1
2796,LUK,24,NRSV,they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate in their presence,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword,1
2797,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with youthat everything written about me in the law of moses the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled,i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind just as the testimony of christ has been strengthened among you so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ,1
2798,LUK,24,NRSV,then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures and he said to them thus it is written that the messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations beginning from jerusalem,jesus heard that they had driven him out and when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man,1
2799,LUK,24,NRSV,you are witnesses of these things,this was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet isaiah lord who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed,1
2800,LUK,24,NRSV,and see i am sending upon you what my father promised so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high,they were in fact planning an ambush to kill him along the way,1
2801,LUK,24,NRSV,then he led them out as far as bethany and lifting up his hands he blessed them,he was in the world and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know him,1
2802,LUK,24,NRSV,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,or are you the only ones it has reached anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must acknowledge that what i am writing to you is a command of the lord,1
2803,LUK,24,NRSV,and they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and they were continually in the temple blessing god,and when they had taken their places and were eating jesus said truly i tell you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me,1
2804,JHN,1,NRSV,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world,1
2805,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the beginning with god,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first,1
2806,JHN,1,NRSV,all things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being,let anyone be accursed who has no love for the lord,1
2807,JHN,1,NRSV,what has come into being in him was life and the life was the light of all people,for gods foolishness is wiser than human wisdom and gods weakness is stronger than human strength,1
2808,JHN,1,NRSV,the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it,so the sisters sent a message to jesus lord he whom you love is ill,1
2809,JHN,1,NRSV,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,the first said to him i have bought a piece of land and i must go out and see it please accept my regrets,1
2810,JHN,1,NRSV,he came as a witness to testify to the light so that all might believe through him,and god who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god,1
2811,JHN,1,NRSV,he himself was not the light but he came to testify to the light,as it is said today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,1
2812,JHN,1,NRSV,the true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world,jesus said to them children you have no fish have you,1
2813,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the world and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know him,but among you there are some who do not believe,1
2814,JHN,1,NRSV,he came to what was his own and his own people did not accept him,jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,1
2815,JHN,1,NRSV,but to all who received him who believed in his name he gave power to become children of god who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,1
2816,JHN,1,NRSV,and the word became flesh and lived among us and we have seen his glory the glory as of a fathers only son full of grace and truth,that is to bring christ up from the dead,1
2817,JHN,1,NRSV,john testified to him and cried out this was he of whom i said he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me,here you have what is yours,1
2818,JHN,1,NRSV, from his fullness we have all received grace upon grace,then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me come i will show you the judgment of the great whore who is seated on many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and with the wine of whose fornication the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk,1
2819,JHN,1,NRSV,the law indeed was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones,1
2820,JHN,1,NRSV,no one has ever seen god,paul an apostlesent neither by human commission nor from human authorities but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the members of gods family who are with me to the churches of galatia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age according to the will of our god and father to whom be the glory forever and ever,1
2821,JHN,1,NRSV,it is god the only son who is close to the fathers heart who has made him known,but he answered them an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet jonah,1
2822,JHN,1,NRSV,this is the testimony given by john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who are you,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me,1
2823,JHN,1,NRSV,he confessed and did not deny it but confessed i am not the messiah,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened,1
2824,JHN,1,NRSV,and they asked him what then,the earth produces of itself first the stalk then the head then the full grain in the head,1
2825,JHN,1,NRSV,he answered no then they said to him who are you,when they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition,1
2826,JHN,1,NRSV,let us have an answer for those who sent us,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his,1
2827,JHN,1,NRSV,what do you say about yourself,for he not only accepted our appeal but since he is more eager than ever he is going to you of his own accord,1
2828,JHN,1,NRSV,he said i am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as the prophet isaiah said,when they heard that jesus was passing by they shouted lord have mercy on us son of david the crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet but they shouted even more loudly have mercy on us lord son of david jesus stood still and called them saying what do you want me to do for you,1
2829,JHN,1,NRSV,now they had been sent from the pharisees,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man,1
2830,JHN,1,NRSV,they asked him why then are you baptizing if you are neither the messiah nor elijah nor the prophet,so when they met here i lost no time but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought,1
2831,JHN,1,NRSV,john answered them i baptize with water,moreover we had human parents to discipline us and we respected them,1
2832,JHN,1,NRSV,among you stands one whom you do not know the one who is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal,while he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you but he said blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it when the crowds were increasing he began to say this generation is an evil generation it asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah,1
2833,JHN,1,NRSV,this took place in bethany across the jordan where john was baptizing,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later,1
2834,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and declared here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me,after this i looked and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues robed in pure bright linen with golden sashes across their chests,1
2835,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but i came baptizing with water for this reason that he might be revealed to israel,after the uproar had ceased paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them and saying farewell he left for macedonia,1
2836,JHN,1,NRSV,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him,i appeal to you brothers and sisters bear with my word of exhortation for i have written to you briefly,1
2837,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you see the spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the holy spirit,i said to him sir you are the one that knows,1
2838,JHN,1,NRSV,and i myself have seen and have testified that this is the son of god,but jesus aware of their inner thoughts took a little child and put it by his side and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for the least among all of you is the greatest,1
2839,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him,1
2840,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name,1
2841,JHN,1,NRSV,they said to him rabbi which translated means teacher where are you staying,they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers,1
2842,JHN,1,NRSV,he said to them come and see,in the same way every good tree bears good fruit but the bad tree bears bad fruit,1
2843,JHN,1,NRSV,they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day,there is only one who is good,1
2844,JHN,1,NRSV,it was about four oclock in the afternoon,so they said to one another let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see who will get it,1
2845,JHN,1,NRSV,one of the two who heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother,if david thus calls him lord how can he be his son,1
2846,JHN,1,NRSV,he first found his brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated anointed ,for david himself says in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool,1
2847,JHN,1,NRSV,he brought simon to jesus who looked at him and said you are simon son of john,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1
2848,JHN,1,NRSV,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,they kept coming up to him saying hail king of the jews and striking him on the face,1
2849,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day jesus decided to go to galilee,when jesus saw nathanael coming toward him he said of him here is truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit nathanael asked him where did you get to know me,1
2850,JHN,1,NRSV,he found philip and said to him follow me,they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed paul,1
2851,JHN,1,NRSV,now philip was from bethsaida the city of andrew and peter,for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of god,1
2852,JHN,1,NRSV,philip found nathanael and said to him we have found him about whom moses in the law and also the prophets wrote jesus son of joseph from nazareth,people would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the beautiful gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple,1
2853,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael said to him can anything good come out of nazareth,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth,1
2854,JHN,1,NRSV,philip said to him come and see,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,1
2855,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus saw nathanael coming toward him he said of him here is truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit nathanael asked him where did you get to know me,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john came and if you are willing to accept it he is elijah who is to come,1
2856,JHN,1,NRSV,jesus answered i saw you under the fig tree before philip called you,gathered there together were simon peter thomas called the twin nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples,1
2857,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel jesus answered do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi,1
2858,JHN,1,NRSV,you will see greater things than these,he called out father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in agony in these flames,1
2859,JHN,1,NRSV,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,only let us hold fast to what we have attained,1
2860,JHN,2,NRSV,on the third day there was a wedding in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there,from now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing,1
2861,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding,as i looked at it closely i saw fourfooted animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air,1
2862,JHN,2,NRSV,when the wine gave out the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine,and the man sprang up and began to walk,1
2863,JHN,2,NRSV,and jesus said to her woman what concern is that to you and to me,so they answered jesus we do not know,1
2864,JHN,2,NRSV,my hour has not yet come,you have done me no wrong,1
2865,JHN,2,NRSV,his mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god,1
2866,JHN,2,NRSV,now standing there were six stone water jars for the jewish rites of purification each holding twenty or thirty gallons,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night,1
2867,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus said to them fill the jars with water,therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals new moons or sabbaths,1
2868,JHN,2,NRSV,and they filled them up to the brim,the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective,1
2869,JHN,2,NRSV,he said to them now draw some out and take it to the chief steward,then each one will receive commendation from god,1
2870,JHN,2,NRSV,when the steward tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it came from though the servants who had drawn the water knew the steward called the bridegroom and said to him everyone serves the good wine first and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk,but jesus said let her alone why do you trouble her,1
2871,JHN,2,NRSV,but you have kept the good wine until now,besides all this between you and us a great chasm has been fixed so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so and no one can cross from there to us,1
2872,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food,1
2873,JHN,2,NRSV,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days,when they came to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him and said lord have mercy on my son for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly he often falls into the fire and often into the water,1
2874,JHN,2,NRSV,the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1
2875,JHN,2,NRSV,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1
2876,JHN,2,NRSV,making a whip of cords he drove all of them out of the temple both the sheep and the cattle,people will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations,1
2877,JHN,2,NRSV,he also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables,then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying with such violence babylon the great city will be thrown down and will be found no more and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters will be heard in you no more and an artisan of any trade will be found in you no more and the sound of the millstone will be heard in you no more and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more for your merchants were the magnates of the earth and all nations were deceived by your sorcery,1
2878,JHN,2,NRSV,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1
2879,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations,1
2880,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus answered them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,1
2881,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said this temple has been under construction for fortysix years and will you raise it up in three days,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,1
2882,JHN,2,NRSV,but he was speaking of the temple of his body,do you have eyes and fail to see,1
2883,JHN,2,NRSV,after he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word that jesus had spoken,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son,1
2884,JHN,2,NRSV,when he was in jerusalem during the passover festival many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing,they said to her woman why are you weeping,1
2885,JHN,2,NRSV,but jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to testify about anyone for he himself knew what was in everyone,surely from now on all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me and holy is his name,1
2886,JHN,3,NRSV,now there was a pharisee named nicodemus a leader of the jews,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god,1
2887,JHN,3,NRSV,he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god,meanwhile he stayed in joppa for some time with a certain simon a tanner,1
2888,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,1
2889,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can anyone be born after having grown old,even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever,1
2890,JHN,3,NRSV,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son,1
2891,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit,the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he cured them,1
2892,JHN,3,NRSV,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit,you snakes you brood of vipers how can you escape being sentenced to hell,1
2893,JHN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished that i said to you you must be born from above,then his mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent to him and called him,1
2894,JHN,3,NRSV,the wind blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes,for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all,1
2895,JHN,3,NRSV,so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit,the jews answered him we have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the son of god,1
2896,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can these things be,you cannot serve god and wealth,1
2897,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things,the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water,1
2898,JHN,3,NRSV,very truly i tell you we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen yet you do not receive our testimony,as for yourselves beware for they will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them,1
2899,JHN,3,NRSV,if i have told you about earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if i tell you about heavenly things,then they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia,1
2900,JHN,3,NRSV,no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven the son of man,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1
2901,JHN,3,NRSV,and just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life,and it was there until the time of david who found favor with god and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of jacob,1
2902,JHN,3,NRSV,for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life,make every effort to send zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way and see that they lack nothing,1
2903,JHN,3,NRSV,indeed god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him,how did he open your eyes,1
2904,JHN,3,NRSV,those who believe in him are not condemned but those who do not believe are condemned already because they have not believed in the name of the only son of god,some fell into good soil and when it grew it produced a hundredfold,1
2905,JHN,3,NRSV,and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,we set sail from troas and took a straight course to samothrace the following day to neapolis and from there to philippi which is a leading city of the district of macedonia and a roman colony,1
2906,JHN,3,NRSV,for all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light so that their deeds may not be exposed,let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift,1
2907,JHN,3,NRSV,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god,now at the time of the incense offering the whole assembly of the people was praying outside,1
2908,JHN,3,NRSV,after this jesus and his disciples went into the judean countryside and he spent some time there with them and baptized,then he put them all outside and took the childs father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was,1
2909,JHN,3,NRSV,john also was baptizing at aenon near salim because water was abundant there and people kept coming and were being baptized john of course had not yet been thrown into prison,and how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard,1
2910,JHN,3,NRSV,now a discussion about purification arose between johns disciples and a jew,this became known throughout joppa and many believed in the lord,1
2911,JHN,3,NRSV,they came to john and said to him rabbi the one who was with you across the jordan to whom you testified here he is baptizing and all are going to him,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread,1
2912,JHN,3,NRSV,john answered no one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven,if you invoke as father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds live in reverent fear during the time of your exile,1
2913,JHN,3,NRSV,you yourselves are my witnesses that i said i am not the messiah but i have been sent ahead of him,and he stood up and went to his home,1
2914,JHN,3,NRSV,he who has the bride is the bridegroom,i saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun having the seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea saying do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have marked the servants of our god with a seal on their foreheads,1
2915,JHN,3,NRSV,the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegrooms voice,and i tell you everyone who acknowledges me before others the son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of god but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of god,1
2916,JHN,3,NRSV,for this reason my joy has been fulfilled,he opposes and exalts himself above every socalled god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god declaring himself to be god,1
2917,JHN,3,NRSV,he must increase but i must decrease,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor,1
2918,JHN,3,NRSV,the one who comes from above is above all the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things,the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each one to his home and you will leave me alone,1
2919,JHN,3,NRSV,the one who comes from heaven is above all,and they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts,1
2920,JHN,3,NRSV,he testifies to what he has seen and heard yet no one accepts his testimony,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him,1
2921,JHN,3,NRSV,whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this that god is true,now all the athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new,1
2922,JHN,3,NRSV,he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he gives the spirit without measure,and when i was with you and was in need i did not burden anyone for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from macedonia,1
2923,JHN,3,NRSV,the father loves the son and has placed all things in his hands,but by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us,1
2924,JHN,3,NRSV,whoever believes in the son has eternal life whoever disobeys the son will not see life but must endure gods wrath,but some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,1
2925,JHN,4,NRSV,now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized he left judea and started back to galilee,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of the one on whom a price had been set on whom some of the people of israel had set a price and they gave them for the potters field as the lord commanded me,1
2926,JHN,4,NRSV,but he had to go through samaria,if you belonged to the world the world would love you as its own,1
2927,JHN,4,NRSV,so he came to a samaritan city called sychar near the plot of ground that jacob had given to his son joseph,what is it that they testify against you,1
2928,JHN,4,NRSV,jacobs well was there and jesus tired out by his journey was sitting by the well,he also said the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how,1
2929,JHN,4,NRSV,a samaritan woman came to draw water and jesus said to her give me a drink,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk,1
2930,JHN,4,NRSV,his disciples had gone to the city to buy food the samaritan woman said to him how is it that you a jew ask a drink of me a woman of samaria,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1
2931,JHN,4,NRSV,jews do not share things in common with samaritans jesus answered her if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water,the earth shook and the rocks were split,1
2932,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir you have no bucket and the well is deep,again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy,1
2933,JHN,4,NRSV,where do you get that living water,then he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and stay awake with me,1
2934,JHN,4,NRSV,are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first,1
2935,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty,so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty,1
2936,JHN,4,NRSV,the water that i will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life,look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces,1
2937,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water,by faith abraham when put to the test offered up isaac,1
2938,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her go call your husband and come back,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god,1
2939,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman answered him i have no husband,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder,1
2940,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband,jesus answered i have spoken openly to the world i have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together,1
2941,JHN,4,NRSV,what you have said is true the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet,in the morning while it was still very dark he got up and went out to a deserted place and there he prayed,1
2942,JHN,4,NRSV,our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another,1
2943,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem,or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered,1
2944,JHN,4,NRSV,you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews,amazement seized all of them and they glorified god and were filled with awe saying we have seen strange things today,1
2945,JHN,4,NRSV,but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem,1
2946,JHN,4,NRSV,god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth,did you not know that i must be in my fathers house,1
2947,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him i know that messiah is coming who is called christ,those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it,1
2948,JHN,4,NRSV,when he comes he will proclaim all things to us,and jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,1
2949,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her i am he the one who is speaking to you,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words,1
2950,JHN,4,NRSV,they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman but no one said what do you want,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds he also adds i will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more,1
2951,JHN,4,NRSV,or why are you speaking with her,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,1
2952,JHN,4,NRSV,then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,1
2953,JHN,4,NRSV,she said to the people come and see a man who told me everything i have ever done he cannot be the messiah can he,yet this is to your credit you hate the works of the nicolaitans which i also hate,1
2954,JHN,4,NRSV,they left the city and were on their way to him,these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur,1
2955,JHN,4,NRSV,meanwhile the disciples were urging him rabbi eat something,and whoever sees me sees him who sent me,1
2956,JHN,4,NRSV,but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,1
2957,JHN,4,NRSV,so the disciples said to one another surely no one has brought him something to eat,by examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him,1
2958,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work,as he approached jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging,1
2959,JHN,4,NRSV,do you not say four months more then comes the harvest,this happened three times and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven,1
2960,JHN,4,NRSV,but i tell you look around you and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting,in fact to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you,1
2961,JHN,4,NRSV,the reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together,when his daughter herodias came in and danced she pleased herod and his guests and the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you wish and i will give it,1
2962,JHN,4,NRSV,for here the saying holds true one sows and another reaps,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest,1
2963,JHN,4,NRSV,i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor,but she came and knelt before him saying lord help me,1
2964,JHN,4,NRSV,others have labored and you have entered into their labor,and even the hairs of your head are all counted,1
2965,JHN,4,NRSV,many samaritans from that city believed in him because of the womans testimony he told me everything i have ever done,the fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast and its kingdom was plunged into darkness people gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and sores and they did not repent of their deeds,1
2966,JHN,4,NRSV,so when the samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days,nathanael said to him can anything good come out of nazareth,1
2967,JHN,4,NRSV,and many more believed because of his word,i was in the spirit on the lords day and i heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches to ephesus to smyrna to pergamum to thyatira to sardis to philadelphia and to laodicea,1
2968,JHN,4,NRSV,they said to the woman it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this is truly the savior of the world,saul became increasingly more powerful and confounded the jews who lived in damascus by proving that jesus was the messiah,1
2969,JHN,4,NRSV,when the two days were over he went from that place to galilee for jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophets own country,when they had come near jerusalem and had reached bethphage at the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples saying to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me,1
2970,JHN,4,NRSV,when he came to galilee the galileans welcomed him since they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival,it is sown in weakness it is raised in power,1
2971,JHN,4,NRSV,then he came again to cana in galilee where he had changed the water into wine,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,1
2972,JHN,4,NRSV,now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in capernaum,but among them were some men of cyprus and cyrene who on coming to antioch spoke to the hellenists also proclaiming the lord jesus,1
2973,JHN,4,NRSV,when he heard that jesus had come from judea to galilee he went and begged him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring,1
2974,JHN,4,NRSV,then jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe,and this was how i saw the horses in my vision the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur the heads of the horses were like lions heads and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths,1
2975,JHN,4,NRSV,the official said to him sir come down before my little boy dies,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,1
2976,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to him go your son will live,they are blots and blemishes reveling in their dissipation while they feast with you,1
2977,JHN,4,NRSV,the man believed the word that jesus spoke to him and started on his way,now the passover the festival of the jews was near,1
2978,JHN,4,NRSV,as he was going down his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive,the rich man also died and was buried,1
2979,JHN,4,NRSV,so he asked them the hour when he began to recover and they said to him yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court,1
2980,JHN,4,NRSV,the father realized that this was the hour when jesus had said to him your son will live,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing,1
2981,JHN,4,NRSV,so he himself believed along with his whole household,therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour,1
2982,JHN,4,NRSV,now this was the second sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee,then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he had found him he brought him to antioch,1
2983,JHN,5,NRSV,after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem,for it is written in the law of moses you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,1
2984,JHN,5,NRSV,now in jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool called in hebrew bethzatha which has five porticoes,then i washed and now i see,1
2985,JHN,5,NRSV,in these lay many invalidsblind lame and paralyzed,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,1
2986,JHN,5,NRSV,one man was there who had been ill for thirtyeight years,then a cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud there came a voice this is my son the beloved listen to him suddenly when they looked around they saw no one with them any more but only jesus,1
2987,JHN,5,NRSV,when jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be made well,they told them what jesus had said and they allowed them to take it,1
2988,JHN,5,NRSV,the sick man answered him sir i have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up and while i am making my way someone else steps down ahead of me,make room in your hearts for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one,1
2989,JHN,5,NRSV,jesus said to him stand up take your mat and walk,as servants of god live as free people yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil,1
2990,JHN,5,NRSV,at once the man was made well and he took up his mat and began to walk,in the same way you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders,1
2991,JHN,5,NRSV,now that day was a sabbath,he must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it,1
2992,JHN,5,NRSV,so the jews said to the man who had been cured it is the sabbath it is not lawful for you to carry your mat,we went ahead to the ship and set sail for assos intending to take paul on board there for he had made this arrangement intending to go by land himself,1
2993,JHN,5,NRSV,but he answered them the man who made me well said to me take up your mat and walk,having said this he breathed his last,1
2994,JHN,5,NRSV,they asked him who is the man who said to you take it up and walk,then another angel came out from the altar the angel who has authority over fire and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for its grapes are ripe,1
2995,JHN,5,NRSV,now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
2996,JHN,5,NRSV,later jesus found him in the temple and said to him see you have been made well do not sin any more so that nothing worse happens to you,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,1
2997,JHN,5,NRSV,the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well,it was added because of transgressions until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made and it was ordained through angels by a mediator,1
2998,JHN,5,NRSV,therefore the jews started persecuting jesus because he was doing such things on the sabbath,but the woman knowing what had happened to her came in fear and trembling fell down before him and told him the whole truth,1
2999,JHN,5,NRSV,but jesus answered them my father is still working and i also am working,for as soon as i heard the sound of your greeting the child in my womb leaped for joy,1
3000,JHN,5,NRSV,for this reason the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he was not only breaking the sabbath but was also calling god his own father thereby making himself equal to god,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming,1
3001,JHN,5,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you the son can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father does the son does likewise,if any believing woman has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows,1
3002,JHN,5,NRSV,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,1
3003,JHN,5,NRSV,indeed just as the father raises the dead and gives them life so also the son gives life to whomever he wishes,like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow into salvation if indeed you have tasted that the lord is good,1
3004,JHN,5,NRSV,the father judges no one but has given all judgment to the son so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father,as he went from there he saw two other brothers james son of zebedee and his brother john in the boat with their father zebedee mending their nets and he called them,1
3005,JHN,5,NRSV,anyone who does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd,1
3006,JHN,5,NRSV,very truly i tell you anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment but has passed from death to life,the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to israel,1
3007,JHN,5,NRSV,very truly i tell you the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live,in his anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground when he got up from prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief and he said to them why are you sleeping,1
3008,JHN,5,NRSV,for just as the father has life in himself so he has granted the son also to have life in himself and he has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the son of man,then i saw heaven opened and there was a white horse its rider is called faithful and true and in righteousness he judges and makes war,1
3009,JHN,5,NRSV,do not be astonished at this for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and will come outthose who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation,these are the ways you also once followed when you were living that life,1
3010,JHN,5,NRSV,i can do nothing on my own,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village,1
3011,JHN,5,NRSV,as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me,assuming that he was in the group of travelers they went a days journey,1
3012,JHN,5,NRSV,if i testify about myself my testimony is not true,now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due,1
3013,JHN,5,NRSV,there is another who testifies on my behalf and i know that his testimony to me is true,remember your leaders those who spoke the word of god to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith,1
3014,JHN,5,NRSV,you sent messengers to john and he testified to the truth,and they filled them up to the brim,1
3015,JHN,5,NRSV,not that i accept such human testimony but i say these things so that you may be saved,but after i am raised up i will go before you to galilee,1
3016,JHN,5,NRSV,he was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me,1
3017,JHN,5,NRSV,but i have a testimony greater than johns,you yourselves are my witnesses that i said i am not the messiah but i have been sent ahead of him,1
3018,JHN,5,NRSV,the works that the father has given me to complete the very works that i am doing testify on my behalf that the father has sent me,so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god,1
3019,JHN,5,NRSV,and the father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf,he answered them and why do you break the commandment of god for the sake of your tradition,1
3020,JHN,5,NRSV,you have never heard his voice or seen his form and you do not have his word abiding in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent,the believers from there when they heard of us came as far as the forum of appius and three taverns to meet us,1
3021,JHN,5,NRSV,you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is they that testify on my behalf,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison,1
3022,JHN,5,NRSV,yet you refuse to come to me to have life,but now dear lady i ask you not as though i were writing you a new commandment but one we have had from the beginning let us love one another,1
3023,JHN,5,NRSV,i do not accept glory from human beings,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,1
3024,JHN,5,NRSV,but i know that you do not have the love of god in you,so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say,1
3025,JHN,5,NRSV,i have come in my fathers name and you do not accept me if another comes in his own name you will accept him,but even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you let that one be accursed as we have said before so now i repeat if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received let that one be accursed am i now seeking human approval or gods approval,1
3026,JHN,5,NRSV,how can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is god,for just as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is also dead,1
3027,JHN,5,NRSV,do not think that i will accuse you before the father your accuser is moses on whom you have set your hope,my friends if anyone is detected in a transgression you who have received the spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness,1
3028,JHN,5,NRSV,if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me,they shouted in reply not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a bandit,1
3029,JHN,5,NRSV,but if you do not believe what he wrote how will you believe what i say,as for those who in the present age are rich command them not to be haughty or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but rather on god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment,1
3030,JHN,6,NRSV,after this jesus went to the other side of the sea of galilee also called the sea of tiberias,i am reminded of your sincere faith a faith that lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and now i am sure lives in you,1
3031,JHN,6,NRSV,a large crowd kept following him because they saw the signs that he was doing for the sick,he went to be registered with mary to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child,1
3032,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus went up the mountain and sat down there with his disciples,caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it was better to have one person die for the people,1
3033,JHN,6,NRSV,now the passover the festival of the jews was near,he answered them you faithless generation how much longer must i be among you,1
3034,JHN,6,NRSV,when he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him jesus said to philip where are we to buy bread for these people to eat,so they said to him what sign are you going to give us then so that we may see it and believe you,1
3035,JHN,6,NRSV,he said this to test him for he himself knew what he was going to do,a third of the sea became blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed,1
3036,JHN,6,NRSV,philip answered him six months wages would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little,whoever is from god hears the words of god,1
3037,JHN,6,NRSV,one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother said to him there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish,now he is god not of the dead but of the living for to him all of them are alive,1
3038,JHN,6,NRSV,but what are they among so many people,then i saw an angel standing in the sun and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly in midheaven come gather for the great supper of god to eat the flesh of kings the flesh of captains the flesh of the mighty the flesh of horses and their ridersflesh of all both free and slave both small and great,1
3039,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus said make the people sit down,for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them,1
3040,JHN,6,NRSV,now there was a great deal of grass in the place so they sat down about five thousand in all,abraham was the father of isaac and isaac the father of jacob and jacob the father of judah and his brothers and judah the father of perez and zerah by tamar and perez the father of hezron and hezron the father of aram and aram the father of aminadab and aminadab the father of nahshon and nahshon the father of salmon and salmon the father of boaz by rahab and boaz the father of obed by ruth and obed the father of jesse and jesse the father of king david,1
3041,JHN,6,NRSV,then jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so also the fish as much as they wanted,some pharisees came to him and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause,1
3042,JHN,6,NRSV,when they were satisfied he told his disciples gather up the fragments left over so that nothing may be lost,were you a slave when called,1
3043,JHN,6,NRSV,so they gathered them up and from the fragments of the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten they filled twelve baskets,may the lord grant mercy to the household of onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain when he arrived in rome he eagerly searched for me and found me may the lord grant that he will find mercy from the lord on that day and you know very well how much service he rendered in ephesus,1
3044,JHN,6,NRSV,when the people saw the sign that he had done they began to say this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,1
3045,JHN,6,NRSV,when jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king he withdrew again to the mountain by himself,yet i am not alone because the father is with me,1
3046,JHN,6,NRSV,when evening came his disciples went down to the sea got into a boat and started across the sea to capernaum,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,1
3047,JHN,6,NRSV,it was now dark and jesus had not yet come to them,even so many will follow their licentious ways and because of these teachers the way of truth will be maligned,1
3048,JHN,6,NRSV,the sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing,for i testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in laodicea and in hierapolis,1
3049,JHN,6,NRSV,when they had rowed about three or four miles they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were terrified,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,1
3050,JHN,6,NRSV,but he said to them it is i do not be afraid,the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask is this not the man who used to sit and beg,1
3051,JHN,6,NRSV,then they wanted to take him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,1
3052,JHN,6,NRSV,the next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there,then everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved,1
3053,JHN,6,NRSV,they also saw that jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone,then the jews began to complain about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven,1
3054,JHN,6,NRSV,then some boats from tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the lord had given thanks,we were in all two hundred seventysix persons in the ship after they had satisfied their hunger they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea,1
3055,JHN,6,NRSV,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,1
3056,JHN,6,NRSV,when they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him rabbi when did you come here,look at what is before your eyes,1
3057,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves,i knew that you always hear me but i have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me,1
3058,JHN,6,NRSV,do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the son of man will give you,instead as he who called you is holy be holy yourselves in all your conduct for it is written you shall be holy for i am holy,1
3059,JHN,6,NRSV,for it is on him that god the father has set his seal,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also and jason has entertained them as guests,1
3060,JHN,6,NRSV,then they said to him what must we do to perform the works of god,then the jews began to complain about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven,1
3061,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent,we have therefore sent judas and silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth,1
3062,JHN,6,NRSV,so they said to him what sign are you going to give us then so that we may see it and believe you,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,1
3063,JHN,6,NRSV,our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat,all who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves will be exalted,1
3064,JHN,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he,1
3065,JHN,6,NRSV,for the bread of god is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world,when jesus had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him saying lord if you choose you can make me clean,1
3066,JHN,6,NRSV,they said to him sir give us this bread always,then he went down from judea to caesarea and stayed there,1
3067,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus said to them i am the bread of life,but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days,1
3068,JHN,6,NRSV,whoever comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty,thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets,1
3069,JHN,6,NRSV,but i said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe,for judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy mercy triumphs over judgment,1
3070,JHN,6,NRSV,everything that the father gives me will come to me and anyone who comes to me i will never drive away for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me,but you have been anointed by the holy one and all of you have knowledge,1
3071,JHN,6,NRSV,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day,after greeting them he related one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry,1
3072,JHN,6,NRSV,this is indeed the will of my father that all who see the son and believe in him may have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day,if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you,1
3073,JHN,6,NRSV,then the jews began to complain about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven,so he argued in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there,1
3074,JHN,6,NRSV,they were saying is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest,1
3075,JHN,6,NRSV,how can he now say i have come down from heaven,but jesus turned to them and said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,1
3076,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them do not complain among yourselves,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,1
3077,JHN,6,NRSV,no one can come to me unless drawn by the father who sent me and i will raise that person up on the last day,if you are the messiah tell us plainly,1
3078,JHN,6,NRSV,it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught by god,certainly not let them come and take us out themselves,1
3079,JHN,6,NRSV,everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me,early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb,1
3080,JHN,6,NRSV,not that anyone has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father,i desire that you insist on these things so that those who have come to believe in god may be careful to devote themselves to good works these things are excellent and profitable to everyone,1
3081,JHN,6,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever believes has eternal life,all of them from the least to the greatest listened to him eagerly saying this man is the power of god that is called great,1
3082,JHN,6,NRSV,i am the bread of life,then jesus again greatly disturbed came to the tomb,1
3083,JHN,6,NRSV,your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and they died,other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and it sprang up quickly since it had no depth of soil,1
3084,JHN,6,NRSV,this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die,now there were devout jews from every nation under heaven living in jerusalem,1
3085,JHN,6,NRSV,i am the living bread that came down from heaven,it is because you cannot accept my word,1
3086,JHN,6,NRSV,whoever eats of this bread will live forever and the bread that i will give for the life of the world is my flesh,but judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor,1
3087,JHN,6,NRSV,the jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,he went into all the region around the jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet isaiah the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1
3088,JHN,6,NRSV,so jesus said to them very truly i tell you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you,and may the lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all just as we abound in love for you,1
3089,JHN,6,NRSV,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink,as for me i am already being poured out as a libation and the time of my departure has come,1
3090,JHN,6,NRSV,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me and i in them,now god did not subject the coming world about which we are speaking to angels,1
3091,JHN,6,NRSV,just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so whoever eats me will live because of me,he answered i tell you if these were silent the stones would shout out,1
3092,JHN,6,NRSV,this is the bread that came down from heaven not like that which your ancestors ate and they died,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses,1
3093,JHN,6,NRSV,but the one who eats this bread will live forever,then they secretly instigated some men to say we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god,1
3094,JHN,6,NRSV,he said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at capernaum,by no means although everyone is a liar let god be proved true as it is written so that you may be justified in your words and prevail in your judging,1
3095,JHN,6,NRSV,when many of his disciples heard it they said this teaching is difficult who can accept it,so he set off and went to his father,1
3096,JHN,6,NRSV,but jesus being aware that his disciples were complaining about it said to them does this offend you,and the report of this spread throughout that district,1
3097,JHN,6,NRSV,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before,you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews,1
3098,JHN,6,NRSV,it is the spirit that gives life the flesh is useless,when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of it they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd shouting friends why are you doing this,1
3099,JHN,6,NRSV,the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life,untie it and bring it here,1
3100,JHN,6,NRSV,but among you there are some who do not believe,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep,1
3101,JHN,6,NRSV,for jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe and who was the one that would betray him,your will be done on earth as it is in heaven,1
3102,JHN,6,NRSV,and he said for this reason i have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the father,for as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away so too will be the coming of the son of man,1
3103,JHN,6,NRSV,because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him,now large crowds were traveling with him and he turned and said to them whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and even life itself cannot be my disciple,1
3104,JHN,6,NRSV,so jesus asked the twelve do you also wish to go away,as it is there are many members yet one body,1
3105,JHN,6,NRSV,simon peter answered him lord to whom can we go,go he said and show yourself to the priest and as moses commanded make an offering for your cleansing for a testimony to them,1
3106,JHN,6,NRSV,you have the words of eternal life,to this end we always pray for you asking that our god will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ,1
3107,JHN,6,NRSV,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,but the advocate the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you,1
3108,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them did i not choose you the twelve,and the chains fell off his wrists,1
3109,JHN,6,NRSV,yet one of you is a devil,but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven,1
3110,JHN,6,NRSV,he was speaking of judas son of simon iscariot for he though one of the twelve was going to betray him,when day came the assembly of the elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they brought him to their council,1
3111,JHN,7,NRSV,after this jesus went about in galilee,and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good,1
3112,JHN,7,NRSV,he did not wish to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him,all who saw it began to grumble and said he has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner,1
3113,JHN,7,NRSV,now the jewish festival of booths was near,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine,1
3114,JHN,7,NRSV,so his brothers said to him leave here and go to judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret,then isaiah is so bold as to say i have been found by those who did not seek me i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me,1
3115,JHN,7,NRSV,if you do these things show yourself to the world,beloved we are gods children now what we will be has not yet been revealed,1
3116,JHN,7,NRSV,for not even his brothers believed in him jesus said to them my time has not yet come but your time is always here,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am,1
3117,JHN,7,NRSV,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil,for david says concerning him i saw the lord always before me for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced moreover my flesh will live in hope,1
3118,JHN,7,NRSV,i am not going to this festival for my time has not yet fully come,once while jesus was standing beside the lake of gennesaret and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of god he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets,1
3119,JHN,7,NRSV,after saying this he remained in galilee,but they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people,1
3120,JHN,7,NRSV,but after his brothers had gone to the festival then he also went not publicly but as it were in secret,how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt,1
3121,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were looking for him at the festival and saying where is he,they replied no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit,1
3122,JHN,7,NRSV,and there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power,1
3123,JHN,7,NRSV,while some were saying he is a good man others were saying no he is deceiving the crowd,they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor and saying that he himself is the messiah a king,1
3124,JHN,7,NRSV,yet no one would speak openly about him for fear of the jews,do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world,1
3125,JHN,7,NRSV,about the middle of the festival jesus went up into the temple and began to teach,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret,1
3126,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught,and simon and his companions hunted for him,1
3127,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
3128,JHN,7,NRSV,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,1
3129,JHN,7,NRSV,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him,he answered let us go on to the neighboring towns so that i may proclaim the message there also for that is what i came out to do,1
3130,JHN,7,NRSV,did not moses give you the law,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days,1
3131,JHN,7,NRSV,yet none of you keeps the law,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,1
3132,JHN,7,NRSV,why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me,let anyone with ears listen the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,1
3133,JHN,7,NRSV,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you,i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them,1
3134,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus answered them i performed one work and all of you are astonished,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them,1
3135,JHN,7,NRSV,moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him,1
3136,JHN,7,NRSV,if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of moses may not be broken are you angry with me because i healed a mans whole body on the sabbath,although i am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to me to bring to the gentiles the news of the boundless riches of christ and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in god who created all things so that through the church the wisdom of god in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places,1
3137,JHN,7,NRSV,do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment,when the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was astonished at the teaching about the lord,1
3138,JHN,7,NRSV,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,1
3139,JHN,7,NRSV,and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are,1
3140,JHN,7,NRSV,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,1
3141,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication,1
3142,JHN,7,NRSV,i have not come on my own,now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching himthat she is a sinner,1
3143,JHN,7,NRSV,but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him,for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in gods sight but the doers of the law who will be justified,1
3144,JHN,7,NRSV,i know him because i am from him and he sent me,then peter and john laid their hands on them and they received the holy spirit,1
3145,JHN,7,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him but no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,1
3146,JHN,7,NRSV,yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying when the messiah comes will he do more signs than this man has done,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,1
3147,JHN,7,NRSV,the pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him and the chief priests and pharisees sent temple police to arrest him,when a strong man fully armed guards his castle his property is safe,1
3148,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me,he took her by the hand and said to her talitha cum which means little girl get up and immediately the girl got up and began to walk about she was twelve years of age,1
3149,JHN,7,NRSV,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,1
3150,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we will not find him,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1
3151,JHN,7,NRSV,does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks,immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring johns head,1
3152,JHN,7,NRSV,what does he mean by saying you will search for me and you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom i am the foremost,1
3153,JHN,7,NRSV,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,but the residents of the city were divided some sided with the jews and some with the apostles,1
3154,JHN,7,NRSV,as the scripture has said out of the believers heart shall flow rivers of living water,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment,1
3155,JHN,7,NRSV,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus was not yet glorified,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat,1
3156,JHN,7,NRSV,when they heard these words some in the crowd said this is really the prophet,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1
3157,JHN,7,NRSV,others said this is the messiah,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish,1
3158,JHN,7,NRSV,but some asked surely the messiah does not come from galilee does he,but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him,1
3159,JHN,7,NRSV,has not the scripture said that the messiah is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived,they said lord look here are two swords,1
3160,JHN,7,NRSV,so there was a division in the crowd because of him,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory,1
3161,JHN,7,NRSV,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption,1
3162,JHN,7,NRSV,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him,do not be deceived fornicators idolaters adulterers male prostitutes sodomites thieves the greedy drunkards revilers robbersnone of these will inherit the kingdom of god,1
3163,JHN,7,NRSV,the police answered never has anyone spoken like this then the pharisees replied surely you have not been deceived too have you,he had still one other a beloved son,1
3164,JHN,7,NRSV,has any one of the authorities or of the pharisees believed in him,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,1
3165,JHN,7,NRSV,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1
3166,JHN,7,NRSV,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it,we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness,1
3167,JHN,7,NRSV,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping,1
3168,JHN,7,NRSV,search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from galilee,he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy according to the promise he made to our ancestors to abraham and to his descendants forever,1
3169,JHN,7,NRSV, then each of them went home,for i tell you this scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was counted among the lawless and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled,1
3170,JHN,8,NRSV,while jesus went to the mount of olives,the crowd that followed kept shouting away with him just as paul was about to be brought into the barracks he said to the tribune may i say something to you,1
3171,JHN,8,NRSV,early in the morning he came again to the temple,i tell you i will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,1
3172,JHN,8,NRSV,all the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them,she went out and told those who had been with him while they were mourning and weeping,1
3173,JHN,8,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and making her stand before all of them they said to him teacher this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery,but you are the same and your years will never end,1
3174,JHN,8,NRSV,now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him,1
3175,JHN,8,NRSV,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,1
3176,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground,so they remained for a long time speaking boldly for the lord who testified to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through them,1
3177,JHN,8,NRSV,when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,then the pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight,1
3178,JHN,8,NRSV,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground,to the present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless and we grow weary from the work of our own hands,1
3179,JHN,8,NRSV,when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the elders and jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him,will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,1
3180,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus straightened up and said to her woman where are they,and on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down,1
3181,JHN,8,NRSV,and jesus said neither do i condemn you,when the accusers stood up they did not charge him with any of the crimes that i was expecting,1
3182,JHN,8,NRSV,go your way and from now on do not sin again again jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of the world,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive,1
3183,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,1
3184,JHN,8,NRSV,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right,1
3185,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid because i know where i have come from and where i am going but you do not know where i come from or where i am going,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day,1
3186,JHN,8,NRSV,you judge by human standards i judge no one,therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory,1
3187,JHN,8,NRSV,yet even if i do judge my judgment is valid for it is not i alone who judge but i and the father who sent me,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth,1
3188,JHN,8,NRSV,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father,1
3189,JHN,8,NRSV,i testify on my own behalf and the father who sent me testifies on my behalf,but the angel said to me why are you so amazed,1
3190,JHN,8,NRSV,then they said to him where is your father,yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies,1
3191,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered you know neither me nor my father,then he said are you also still without understanding,1
3192,JHN,8,NRSV,if you knew me you would know my father also,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace,1
3193,JHN,8,NRSV,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ,1
3194,JHN,8,NRSV,again he said to them i am going away and you will search for me but you will die in your sin,has not god chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him,1
3195,JHN,8,NRSV,where i am going you cannot come,and the disciples asked him why then do the scribes say that elijah must come first,1
3196,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said is he going to kill himself,there was also a prophet anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher,1
3197,JHN,8,NRSV,is that what he means by saying where i am going you cannot come,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,1
3198,JHN,8,NRSV,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world,i am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted,1
3199,JHN,8,NRSV,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me,1
3200,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him who are you,so throwing off his cloak he sprang up and came to jesus,1
3201,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table,1
3202,JHN,8,NRSV,i have much to say about you and much to condemn but the one who sent me is true and i declare to the world what i have heard from him,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again,1
3203,JHN,8,NRSV,they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,1
3204,JHN,8,NRSV,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me,they are upsetting the faith of some,1
3205,JHN,8,NRSV,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him,he said i am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as the prophet isaiah said,1
3206,JHN,8,NRSV,as he was saying these things many believed in him,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1
3207,JHN,8,NRSV,then jesus said to the jews who had believed in him if you continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free,when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him,1
3208,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves to anyone,for out of the heart come evil intentions murder adultery fornication theft false witness slander,1
3209,JHN,8,NRSV,what do you mean by saying you will be made free,the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born,1
3210,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin,soon afterwards he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him,1
3211,JHN,8,NRSV,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever,the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life,1
3212,JHN,8,NRSV,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed,then jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god and the disciples were perplexed at these words,1
3213,JHN,8,NRSV,i know that you are descendants of abraham yet you look for an opportunity to kill me because there is no place in you for my word,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,1
3214,JHN,8,NRSV,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father,then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventyfive in all so jacob went down to egypt,1
3215,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him abraham is our father,an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah,1
3216,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing what abraham did but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,1
3217,JHN,8,NRSV,this is not what abraham did,should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute,1
3218,JHN,8,NRSV,you are indeed doing what your father does,after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem,1
3219,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,they said to him we will go with you,1
3220,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here,and just as it is appointed for mortals to die once and after that the judgment so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him,1
3221,JHN,8,NRSV,i did not come on my own but he sent me,resist the devil and he will flee from you,1
3222,JHN,8,NRSV,why do you not understand what i say,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,1
3223,JHN,8,NRSV,it is because you cannot accept my word,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him,1
3224,JHN,8,NRSV,you are from your father the devil and you choose to do your fathers desires,and they said jesus of nazareth,1
3225,JHN,8,NRSV,he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,the angel said to him fasten your belt and put on your sandals,1
3226,JHN,8,NRSV,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us,1
3227,JHN,8,NRSV,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water,1
3228,JHN,8,NRSV,which of you convicts me of sin,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place,1
3229,JHN,8,NRSV,if i tell the truth why do you not believe me,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel,1
3230,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever is from god hears the words of god,but what is the divine reply to him,1
3231,JHN,8,NRSV,the reason you do not hear them is that you are not from god,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you,1
3232,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,and all the people who heard this including the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of god because they had been baptized with johns baptism,1
3233,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me,do you wish to have no fear of the authority,1
3234,JHN,8,NRSV,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,i will rescue you from your people and from the gentilesto whom i am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me,1
3235,JHN,8,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever keeps my word will never see death,our ancestors in turn brought it in with joshua when they dispossessed the nations that god drove out before our ancestors,1
3236,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,1
3237,JHN,8,NRSV,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god,1
3238,JHN,8,NRSV,are you greater than our father abraham who died,in that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying grant me justice against my opponent,1
3239,JHN,8,NRSV,who do you claim to be,the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a violent earthquake such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth so violent was that earthquake,1
3240,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing,erastus remained in corinth trophimus i left ill in miletus,1
3241,JHN,8,NRSV,it is my father who glorifies me he of whom you say he is our god though you do not know him,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,1
3242,JHN,8,NRSV,but i know him if i would say that i do not know him i would be a liar like you,but about that day or hour no one knows neither the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father,1
3243,JHN,8,NRSV,but i do know him and i keep his word,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth,1
3244,JHN,8,NRSV,your ancestor abraham rejoiced that he would see my day he saw it and was glad,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months,1
3245,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,then he said to them you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition for moses said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die,1
3246,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you before abraham was i am,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things,1
3247,JHN,8,NRSV,so they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple,not that anyone has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father,1
3248,JHN,9,NRSV,as he walked along he saw a man blind from birth,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god,1
3249,JHN,9,NRSV,his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit,1
3250,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus answered neither this man nor his parents sinned he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him,we have renounced the shameful things that one hides we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify gods word but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of god,1
3251,JHN,9,NRSV,we must work the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one can work,it was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that was slaughtered,1
3252,JHN,9,NRSV,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world,the lord said to him in a vision ananias,1
3253,JHN,9,NRSV,when he had said this he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the mans eyes saying to him go wash in the pool of siloam which means sent,and when the chief priests and the scribes heard it they kept looking for a way to kill him for they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching,1
3254,JHN,9,NRSV,then he went and washed and came back able to see,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come,1
3255,JHN,9,NRSV,the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask is this not the man who used to sit and beg,the next day paul went with us to visit james and all the elders were present,1
3256,JHN,9,NRSV,some were saying it is he,then the high priest ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth,1
3257,JHN,9,NRSV,others were saying no but it is someone like him,all were amazed and perplexed saying to one another what does this mean,1
3258,JHN,9,NRSV,he kept saying i am the man,then he went about among the villages teaching,1
3259,JHN,9,NRSV,but they kept asking him then how were your eyes opened,and festus said king agrippa and all here present with us you see this man about whom the whole jewish community petitioned me both in jerusalem and here shouting that he ought not to live any longer,1
3260,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash,now about eight days after these sayings jesus took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray,1
3261,JHN,9,NRSV,then i went and washed and received my sight,for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves,1
3262,JHN,9,NRSV,they said to him where is he,i have come in my fathers name and you do not accept me if another comes in his own name you will accept him,1
3263,JHN,9,NRSV,he said i do not know,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me,1
3264,JHN,9,NRSV,they brought to the pharisees the man who had formerly been blind,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1
3265,JHN,9,NRSV,now it was a sabbath day when jesus made the mud and opened his eyes,then the other came saying lord here is your pound,1
3266,JHN,9,NRSV,then the pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,1
3267,JHN,9,NRSV,he said to them he put mud on my eyes,then he told this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and found none,1
3268,JHN,9,NRSV,then i washed and now i see,they were at the tomb early this morning and when they did not find his body there they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive,1
3269,JHN,9,NRSV,some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath,his divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness,1
3270,JHN,9,NRSV,but others said how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs,jesus said to him friend do what you are here to do,1
3271,JHN,9,NRSV,so they said again to the blind man what do you say about him,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,1
3272,JHN,9,NRSV,it was your eyes he opened,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did,1
3273,JHN,9,NRSV,he said he is a prophet,two women will be grinding meal together one will be taken and one will be left,1
3274,JHN,9,NRSV,the jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them is this your son who you say was born blind,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,1
3275,JHN,9,NRSV,how then does he now see,be merciful just as your father is merciful,1
3276,JHN,9,NRSV,his parents answered we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but we do not know how it is that now he sees nor do we know who opened his eyes,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it,1
3277,JHN,9,NRSV,ask him he is of age,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him,1
3278,JHN,9,NRSV,his parents said this because they were afraid of the jews for the jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed jesus to be the messiah would be put out of the synagogue,he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god,1
3279,JHN,9,NRSV,therefore his parents said he is of age ask him,blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes truly i tell you he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat and he will come and serve them,1
3280,JHN,9,NRSV,so for the second time they called the man who had been blind and they said to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner,then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done because they did not repent,1
3281,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered i do not know whether he is a sinner,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,1
3282,JHN,9,NRSV,one thing i do know that though i was blind now i see,the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus,1
3283,JHN,9,NRSV,they said to him what did he do to you,i want you to know brothers and sisters that i have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented in order that i may reap some harvest among you as i have among the rest of the gentiles,1
3284,JHN,9,NRSV,how did he open your eyes,when he was in jerusalem during the passover festival many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing,1
3285,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered them i have told you already and you would not listen,and he said to them have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food,1
3286,JHN,9,NRSV,why do you want to hear it again,pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers,1
3287,JHN,9,NRSV,do you also want to become his disciples,i begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not,1
3288,JHN,9,NRSV,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses,as they were coming down the mountain jesus ordered them tell no one about the vision until after the son of man has been raised from the dead,1
3289,JHN,9,NRSV,we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from,then he appeared to james then to all the apostles,1
3290,JHN,9,NRSV,the man answered here is an astonishing thing you do not know where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,1
3291,JHN,9,NRSV,we know that god does not listen to sinners but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,1
3292,JHN,9,NRSV,never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind,he entered the house of god and ate the bread of the presence which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat but only for the priests,1
3293,JHN,9,NRSV,if this man were not from god he could do nothing,and suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting,1
3294,JHN,9,NRSV,they answered him you were born entirely in sins and are you trying to teach us,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first,1
3295,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus heard that they had driven him out and when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man,i am talking like a madmani am a better one with far greater labors far more imprisonments with countless floggings and often near death,1
3296,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered and who is he sir,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you,1
3297,JHN,9,NRSV,tell me so that i may believe in him,and the one with the two talents also came forward saying master you handed over to me two talents see i have made two more talents,1
3298,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said to him you have seen him and the one speaking with you is he,when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas also the books and above all the parchments,1
3299,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind,then he directed them to give her something to eat,1
3300,JHN,9,NRSV,some of the pharisees near him heard this and said to him surely we are not blind are we,humble yourselves before the lord and he will exalt you,1
3301,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were blind you would not have sin,he said to them you also go into the vineyard,1
3302,JHN,9,NRSV,but now that you say we see your sin remains,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,1
3303,JHN,10,NRSV,very truly i tell you anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit,at that moment she came and began to praise god and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of jerusalem,1
3304,JHN,10,NRSV,the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep,both of them were righteous before god living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the lord,1
3305,JHN,10,NRSV,the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep hear his voice,i john your brother who share with you in jesus the persecution and the kingdom and the patient endurance was on the island called patmos because of the word of god and the testimony of jesus,1
3306,JHN,10,NRSV,he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out,hence as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that no idol in the world really exists and that there is no god but one,1
3307,JHN,10,NRSV,when he has brought out all his own he goes ahead of them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice,the god of this people israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of egypt and with uplifted arm he led them out of it,1
3308,JHN,10,NRSV,they will not follow a stranger but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean,1
3309,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus used this figure of speech with them but they did not understand what he was saying to them,when jesus heard this he said to them those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners,1
3310,JHN,10,NRSV,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep,philip went and told andrew then andrew and philip went and told jesus,1
3311,JHN,10,NRSV,all who came before me are thieves and bandits but the sheep did not listen to them,that is to bring christ up from the dead,1
3312,JHN,10,NRSV,whoever enters by me will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture,there is no longer jew or greek there is no longer slave or free there is no longer male and female for all of you are one in christ jesus,1
3313,JHN,10,NRSV,the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy,paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the tribune for he has something to report to him,1
3314,JHN,10,NRSV,i came that they may have life and have it abundantly,after this jesus went about in galilee,1
3315,JHN,10,NRSV,the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews,1
3316,JHN,10,NRSV,the hired hand who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs awayand the wolf snatches them and scatters them,then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first,1
3317,JHN,10,NRSV,the hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep,but some believers who belonged to the sect of the pharisees stood up and said it is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of moses,1
3318,JHN,10,NRSV,i know my own and my own know me just as the father knows me and i know the father,for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth,1
3319,JHN,10,NRSV,and i lay down my life for the sheep,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,1
3320,JHN,10,NRSV,i have other sheep that do not belong to this fold,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,1
3321,JHN,10,NRSV,i must bring them also and they will listen to my voice,it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification,1
3322,JHN,10,NRSV,so there will be one flock one shepherd,after the uproar had ceased paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them and saying farewell he left for macedonia,1
3323,JHN,10,NRSV,for this reason the father loves me because i lay down my life in order to take it up again,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord,1
3324,JHN,10,NRSV,no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord,but he denied it saying woman i do not know him,1
3325,JHN,10,NRSV,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again,then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray,1
3326,JHN,10,NRSV,i have received this command from my father,i myself did not know him but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you see the spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the holy spirit,1
3327,JHN,10,NRSV,again the jews were divided because of these words,for certain intruders have stolen in among you people who long ago were designated for this condemnation as ungodly who pervert the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ,1
3328,JHN,10,NRSV,many of them were saying he has a demon and is out of his mind,masters treat your slaves justly and fairly for you know that you also have a master in heaven,1
3329,JHN,10,NRSV,others were saying these are not the words of one who has a demon,if those to whom the word of god came were called godsand the scripture cannot be annulled can you say that the one whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because i said i am gods son,1
3330,JHN,10,NRSV,can a demon open the eyes of the blind,therefore i tell you people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven,1
3331,JHN,10,NRSV,at that time the festival of the dedication took place in jerusalem,now when jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all waiting for him,1
3332,JHN,10,NRSV,it was winter and jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of solomon,if any of you is lacking in wisdom ask god who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly and it will be given you,1
3333,JHN,10,NRSV,so the jews gathered around him and said to him how long will you keep us in suspense,this is my message for you,1
3334,JHN,10,NRSV,if you are the messiah tell us plainly,he sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone saying the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,1
3335,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus answered i have told you and you do not believe,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it,1
3336,JHN,10,NRSV,the works that i do in my fathers name testify to me but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep,for you had compassion for those who were in prison and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting,1
3337,JHN,10,NRSV,i know them and they follow me,no one who abides in him sins no one who sins has either seen him or known him,1
3338,JHN,10,NRSV,i give them eternal life and they will never perish,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire,1
3339,JHN,10,NRSV,no one will snatch them out of my hand,and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,1
3340,JHN,10,NRSV,what my father has given me is greater than all else and no one can snatch it out of the fathers hand,he said to them isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their hearts are far from me in vain do they worship me teaching human precepts as doctrines,1
3341,JHN,10,NRSV,the father and i are one,he asked who are you lord,1
3342,JHN,10,NRSV,the jews took up stones again to stone him,now as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in utmost eagerness and in our love for you so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking,1
3343,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus replied i have shown you many good works from the father,and he said to her what do you want,1
3344,JHN,10,NRSV,for which of these are you going to stone me,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son,1
3345,JHN,10,NRSV,the jews answered it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you though only a human being are making yourself god,for i am ready not only to be bound but even to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus,1
3346,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus answered is it not written in your law i said you are gods,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me,1
3347,JHN,10,NRSV,if those to whom the word of god came were called godsand the scripture cannot be annulled can you say that the one whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because i said i am gods son,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,1
3348,JHN,10,NRSV,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me,he is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that god wills,1
3349,JHN,10,NRSV,but if i do them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i am in the father,by the tender mercy of our god the dawn from on high will break upon us to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace,1
3350,JHN,10,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him again but he escaped from their hands,then he began to speak to them in parables,1
3351,JHN,10,NRSV,he went away again across the jordan to the place where john had been baptizing earlier and he remained there,i say this to your shame,1
3352,JHN,10,NRSV,many came to him and they were saying john performed no sign but everything that john said about this man was true,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him,1
3353,JHN,10,NRSV,and many believed in him there,but get up and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do,1
3354,JHN,11,NRSV,now a certain man was ill lazarus of bethany the village of mary and her sister martha,god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them,1
3355,JHN,11,NRSV,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,1
3356,JHN,11,NRSV,so the sisters sent a message to jesus lord he whom you love is ill,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law,1
3357,JHN,11,NRSV,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it,timothy my coworker greets you so do lucius and jason and sosipater my relatives,1
3358,JHN,11,NRSV,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,when he opened the sixth seal i looked and there came a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale,1
3359,JHN,11,NRSV,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself,1
3360,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him rabbi the jews were just now trying to stone you and are you going there again,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it,1
3361,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight,the disciples went and did as jesus had directed them they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and he sat on them,1
3362,JHN,11,NRSV,those who walk during the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1
3363,JHN,11,NRSV,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness,1
3364,JHN,11,NRSV,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him,if anyone strikes you on the cheek offer the other also and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt,1
3365,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right,for this reason they are before the throne of god and worship him day and night within his temple and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them,1
3366,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus however had been speaking about his death but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep,for you may give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up,1
3367,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus told them plainly lazarus is dead,and at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each,1
3368,JHN,11,NRSV,for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe,then after completing their mission barnabas and saul returned to jerusalem and brought with them john whose other name was mark,1
3369,JHN,11,NRSV,but let us go to him,you heard me say to you i am going away and i am coming to you,1
3370,JHN,11,NRSV,thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him,whoever says i have come to know him but does not obey his commandments is a liar and in such a person the truth does not exist but whoever obeys his word truly in this person the love of god has reached perfection,1
3371,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days,for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god,1
3372,JHN,11,NRSV,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles away and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother,and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of dalmanutha,1
3373,JHN,11,NRSV,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home,we intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering for we intend to do what is right not only in the lords sight but also in the sight of others,1
3374,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather,1
3375,JHN,11,NRSV,but even now i know that god will give you whatever you ask of him,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee,1
3376,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her your brother will rise again,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them show me a denarius,1
3377,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years,1
3378,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life,if then you are not able to do so small a thing as that why do you worry about the rest,1
3379,JHN,11,NRSV,those who believe in me even though they die will live and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die,therefore since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god,1
3380,JHN,11,NRSV,she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the messiah the son of god the one coming into the world,and you are clean though not all of you,1
3381,JHN,11,NRSV,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you,am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me,1
3382,JHN,11,NRSV,and when she heard it she got up quickly and went to him,christ however was faithful over gods house as a son and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope,1
3383,JHN,11,NRSV,now jesus had not yet come to the village but was still at the place where martha had met him,for this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal,1
3384,JHN,11,NRSV,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out,when he came to galilee the galileans welcomed him since they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival,1
3385,JHN,11,NRSV,they followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,1
3386,JHN,11,NRSV,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,he is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that god wills,1
3387,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved,paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1
3388,JHN,11,NRSV,he said where have you laid him,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,1
3389,JHN,11,NRSV,they said to him lord come and see,soon afterwards he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him,1
3390,JHN,11,NRSV,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,look those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces,1
3391,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus again greatly disturbed came to the tomb,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus,1
3392,JHN,11,NRSV,it was a cave and a stone was lying against it,it is before their own lord that they stand or fall,1
3393,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said take away the stone,the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word love your neighbor as yourself,1
3394,JHN,11,NRSV,martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human,1
3395,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,1
3396,JHN,11,NRSV,so they took away the stone,now there were seven brothers the first married and died childless then the second and the third married her and so in the same way all seven died childless,1
3397,JHN,11,NRSV,and jesus looked upward and said father i thank you for having heard me,it was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him,1
3398,JHN,11,NRSV,i knew that you always hear me but i have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me,i have written something to the church but diotrephes who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority,1
3399,JHN,11,NRSV,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,therefore one must be subject not only because of wrath but also because of conscience,1
3400,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to them unbind him and let him go,and it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people,1
3401,JHN,11,NRSV,many of the jews therefore who had come with mary and had seen what jesus did believed in him,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1
3402,JHN,11,NRSV,but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what he had done,and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us,1
3403,JHN,11,NRSV,so the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the council and said what are we to do,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him,1
3404,JHN,11,NRSV,this man is performing many signs,even upon my slaves both men and women in those days i will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy,1
3405,JHN,11,NRSV,if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation,they said to him where is he,1
3406,JHN,11,NRSV,but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all you do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed,but i tell you from now on you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven,1
3407,JHN,11,NRSV,he did not say this on his own but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus was about to die for the nation and not for the nation only but to gather into one the dispersed children of god,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1
3408,JHN,11,NRSV,so from that day on they planned to put him to death,as they went away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at,1
3409,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the jews but went from there to a town called ephraim in the region near the wilderness and he remained there with the disciples,you blind guides you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence,1
3410,JHN,11,NRSV,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side,1
3411,JHN,11,NRSV,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves,1
3412,JHN,11,NRSV,surely he will not come to the festival will he,he denied it and said i am not,1
3413,JHN,11,NRSV,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,now that day was a sabbath,1
3414,JHN,12,NRSV,six days before the passover jesus came to bethany the home of lazarus whom he had raised from the dead,therefore come out from them and be separate from them says the lord and touch nothing unclean then i will welcome you and i will be your father and you shall be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty,1
3415,JHN,12,NRSV,there they gave a dinner for him,he took her by the hand and said to her talitha cum which means little girl get up and immediately the girl got up and began to walk about she was twelve years of age,1
3416,JHN,12,NRSV,martha served and lazarus was one of those at the table with him,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils,1
3417,JHN,12,NRSV,mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard anointed jesus feet and wiped them with her hair,indeed there have to be factions among you for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine,1
3418,JHN,12,NRSV,the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume,first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone for kings and all who are in high positions so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity,1
3419,JHN,12,NRSV,but judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise none of the seven left children,1
3420,JHN,12,NRSV,he said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it jesus said leave her alone,in whatever condition you were called brothers and sisters there remain with god,1
3421,JHN,12,NRSV,she bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest,1
3422,JHN,12,NRSV,you always have the poor with you but you do not always have me,jesus said to them if you were blind you would not have sin,1
3423,JHN,12,NRSV,when the great crowd of the jews learned that he was there they came not only because of jesus but also to see lazarus whom he had raised from the dead,deacons likewise must be serious not doubletongued not indulging in much wine not greedy for money they must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience,1
3424,JHN,12,NRSV,so the chief priests planned to put lazarus to death as well since it was on account of him that many of the jews were deserting and were believing in jesus,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened,1
3425,JHN,12,NRSV,the next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem,a great portent appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars,1
3426,JHN,12,NRSV,so they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord the king of israel jesus found a young donkey and sat on it as it is written do not be afraid daughter of zion,no more can salt water yield fresh,1
3427,JHN,12,NRSV,look your king is coming sitting on a donkeys colt his disciples did not understand these things at first but when jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him,and you say whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath,1
3428,JHN,12,NRSV,so the crowd that had been with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify,i was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth just as we have been commanded by the father,1
3429,JHN,12,NRSV,it was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up,1
3430,JHN,12,NRSV,the pharisees then said to one another you see you can do nothing,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name,1
3431,JHN,12,NRSV,look the world has gone after him now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some greeks,so then whenever we have an opportunity let us work for the good of all and especially for those of the family of faith,1
3432,JHN,12,NRSV,they came to philip who was from bethsaida in galilee and said to him sir we wish to see jesus,god is treating you as children for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline,1
3433,JHN,12,NRSV,philip went and told andrew then andrew and philip went and told jesus,i will most gladly spend and be spent for you,1
3434,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus answered them the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified,when paul had been summoned tertullus began to accuse him saying your excellency because of you we have long enjoyed peace and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight,1
3435,JHN,12,NRSV,very truly i tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain but if it dies it bears much fruit,now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized he left judea and started back to galilee,1
3436,JHN,12,NRSV,those who love their life lose it and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life,but about that day and hour no one knows neither the angels of heaven nor the son but only the father,1
3437,JHN,12,NRSV,whoever serves me must follow me and where i am there will my servant be also,simon answered pray for me to the lord that nothing of what you have said may happen to me,1
3438,JHN,12,NRSV,whoever serves me the father will honor,then the believers immediately sent paul away to the coast but silas and timothy remained behind,1
3439,JHN,12,NRSV,and what should i sayfather save me from this hour,they forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth,1
3440,JHN,12,NRSV,no it is for this reason that i have come to this hour,if he cannot then while the other is still far away he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace,1
3441,JHN,12,NRSV,then a voice came from heaven i have glorified it and i will glorify it again,for what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within,1
3442,JHN,12,NRSV,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder,after that he must be let out for a little while,1
3443,JHN,12,NRSV,others said an angel has spoken to him,for the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done and there is no partiality,1
3444,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus answered this voice has come for your sake not for mine,and after he had dismissed the crowds he went up the mountain by himself to pray,1
3445,JHN,12,NRSV,now is the judgment of this world now the ruler of this world will be driven out,on the following day when they came from bethany he was hungry,1
3446,JHN,12,NRSV,and i when i am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me,1
3447,JHN,12,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die,each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor,1
3448,JHN,12,NRSV,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah remains forever,i have become all things to all people that i might by all means save some,1
3449,JHN,12,NRSV,how can you say that the son of man must be lifted up,just as they were leaving him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijahnot knowing what he said,1
3450,JHN,12,NRSV,who is this son of man,and he said to her what do you want,1
3451,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus said to them the light is with you for a little longer,now i rejoice not because you were grieved but because your grief led to repentance for you felt a godly grief so that you were not harmed in any way by us,1
3452,JHN,12,NRSV,walk while you have the light so that the darkness may not overtake you,when he had entered he said to them why do you make a commotion and weep,1
3453,JHN,12,NRSV,if you walk in the darkness you do not know where you are going,he went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus then pilate ordered it to be given to him,1
3454,JHN,12,NRSV,while you have the light believe in the light so that you may become children of light,whose head and whose title does it bear,1
3455,JHN,12,NRSV,after jesus had said this he departed and hid from them,so i made up my mind not to make you another painful visit,1
3456,JHN,12,NRSV,although he had performed so many signs in their presence they did not believe in him,jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to those who are called who are beloved in god the father and kept safe for jesus christ may mercy peace and love be yours in abundance,1
3457,JHN,12,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet isaiah lord who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed,he answered i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel,1
3458,JHN,12,NRSV,and so they could not believe because isaiah also said he has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart so that they might not look with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,1
3459,JHN,12,NRSV,isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him,others were saying these are not the words of one who has a demon,1
3460,JHN,12,NRSV,nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him,there was also a prophet anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher,1
3461,JHN,12,NRSV,but because of the pharisees they did not confess it for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue for they loved human glory more than the glory that comes from god,what then did you go out to see,1
3462,JHN,12,NRSV,then jesus cried aloud whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me,as he said this he called out let anyone with ears to hear listen then his disciples asked him what this parable meant,1
3463,JHN,12,NRSV,and whoever sees me sees him who sent me,or who has given a gift to him to receive a gift in return,1
3464,JHN,12,NRSV,i have come as light into the world so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness,consider the lilies how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these,1
3465,JHN,12,NRSV,i do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them for i came not to judge the world but to save the world,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment,1
3466,JHN,12,NRSV,the one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge on the last day the word that i have spoken will serve as judge for i have not spoken on my own but the father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak,for you were bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body,1
3467,JHN,12,NRSV,and i know that his commandment is eternal life,and they were all together in solomons portico,1
3468,JHN,12,NRSV,what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me,if any believing woman has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows,1
3469,JHN,13,NRSV,now before the festival of the passover jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the father,do i say this on human authority,1
3470,JHN,13,NRSV,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,i know who you are the holy one of god,1
3471,JHN,13,NRSV,the devil had already put it into the heart of judas son of simon iscariot to betray him,woe to you who are laughing now for you will mourn and weep,1
3472,JHN,13,NRSV,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself,i know that you cannot tolerate evildoers you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them to be false,1
3473,JHN,13,NRSV,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him,for from him and through him and to him are all things,1
3474,JHN,13,NRSV,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations,1
3475,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,1
3476,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him you will never wash my feet,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,1
3477,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me,when he arrived the jews who had gone down from jerusalem surrounded him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove,1
3478,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him one who has bathed does not need to wash except for the feet but is entirely clean,entirely out of place is obscene silly and vulgar talk but instead let there be thanksgiving,1
3479,JHN,13,NRSV,and you are clean though not all of you,but if anyone does sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world,1
3480,JHN,13,NRSV,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,this is indeed the will of my father that all who see the son and believe in him may have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day,1
3481,JHN,13,NRSV,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,you are observing special days and months and seasons and years,1
3482,JHN,13,NRSV,you call me teacher and lordand you are right for that is what i am,he asked do you understand what you are reading,1
3483,JHN,13,NRSV,so if i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet,when jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side a great crowd gathered around him and he was by the sea,1
3484,JHN,13,NRSV,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping,1
3485,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,then i saw another portent in heaven great and amazing seven angels with seven plagues which are the last for with them the wrath of god is ended,1
3486,JHN,13,NRSV,if you know these things you are blessed if you do them,not that i seek the gift but i seek the profit that accumulates to your account,1
3487,JHN,13,NRSV,i am not speaking of all of you i know whom i have chosen,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit,1
3488,JHN,13,NRSV,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me,will not both fall into a pit,1
3489,JHN,13,NRSV,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he,do not seek to be free,1
3490,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me,he questioned him at some length but jesus gave him no answer,1
3491,JHN,13,NRSV,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me,they told him in bethlehem of judea for so it has been written by the prophet and you bethlehem in the land of judah are by no means least among the rulers of judah for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people israel,1
3492,JHN,13,NRSV,the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he was speaking,i think it right as long as i am in this body to refresh your memory since i know that my death will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me,1
3493,JHN,13,NRSV,one of his disciplesthe one whom jesus lovedwas reclining next to him simon peter therefore motioned to him to ask jesus of whom he was speaking,be subject to one another out of reverence for christ,1
3494,JHN,13,NRSV,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,a windstorm swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in danger,1
3495,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered it is the one to whom i give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye,1
3496,JHN,13,NRSV,so when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot,then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah,1
3497,JHN,13,NRSV,after he received the piece of bread satan entered into him,for last night there stood by me an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i worship and he said do not be afraid paul you must stand before the emperor and indeed god has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you,1
3498,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,1
3499,JHN,13,NRSV,now no one at the table knew why he said this to him,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel,1
3500,JHN,13,NRSV,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor,holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one,1
3501,JHN,13,NRSV,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,1
3502,JHN,13,NRSV,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him,i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg,1
3503,JHN,13,NRSV,if god has been glorified in him god will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once,he trusts in god let god deliver him now if he wants to for he said i am gods son,1
3504,JHN,13,NRSV,little children i am with you only a little longer,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father or who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him,1
3505,JHN,13,NRSV,you will look for me and as i said to the jews so now i say to you where i am going you cannot come,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,1
3506,JHN,13,NRSV,i give you a new commandment that you love one another,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
3507,JHN,13,NRSV,just as i have loved you you also should love one another,for i also am a man under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it,1
3508,JHN,13,NRSV,by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another,after we had sailed across the sea that is off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia,1
3509,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord where are you going,immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him,1
3510,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow afterward,may the god of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another in accordance with christ jesus so that together you may with one voice glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ,1
3511,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him,1
3512,JHN,13,NRSV,i will lay down my life for you,let all that you do be done in love,1
3513,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered will you lay down your life for me,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,1
3514,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you before the cock crows you will have denied me three times,i do not want to seem as though i am trying to frighten you with my letters,1
3515,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled,what i am saying brothers and sisters is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable,1
3516,JHN,14,NRSV,believe in god believe also in me,i do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink,1
3517,JHN,14,NRSV,in my fathers house there are many dwelling places,my brothers and sisters this ought not to be so,1
3518,JHN,14,NRSV,if it were not so would i have told you that i go to prepare a place for you,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me,1
3519,JHN,14,NRSV,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself so that where i am there you may be also,for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers the night is far gone the day is near,1
3520,JHN,14,NRSV,and you know the way to the place where i am going,he said to them now draw some out and take it to the chief steward,1
3521,JHN,14,NRSV,thomas said to him lord we do not know where you are going,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here,1
3522,JHN,14,NRSV,how can we know the way,perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brotherespecially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the lord,1
3523,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive,1
3524,JHN,14,NRSV,no one comes to the father except through me,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god,1
3525,JHN,14,NRSV,if you know me you will know my father also,therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies to make you obey their passions,1
3526,JHN,14,NRSV,from now on you do know him and have seen him,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it,1
3527,JHN,14,NRSV,philip said to him lord show us the father and we will be satisfied,some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him,1
3528,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him have i been with you all this time philip and you still do not know me,in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins,1
3529,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever has seen me has seen the father,at the same time he hoped that money would be given him by paul and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him,1
3530,JHN,14,NRSV,how can you say show us the father,but to the rest of you in thyatira who do not hold this teaching who have not learned what some call the deep things of satan to you i say i do not lay on you any other burden only hold fast to what you have until i come,1
3531,JHN,14,NRSV,do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained,1
3532,JHN,14,NRSV,the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own but the father who dwells in me does his works,i hope to come to you soon but i am writing these instructions to you so that if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and bulwark of the truth,1
3533,JHN,14,NRSV,believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me but if you do not then believe me because of the works themselves,a good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap for the measure you give will be the measure you get back,1
3534,JHN,14,NRSV,very truly i tell you the one who believes in me will also do the works that i do and in fact will do greater works than these because i am going to the father,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,1
3535,JHN,14,NRSV,i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect,1
3536,JHN,14,NRSV,if in my name you ask me for anything i will do it,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1
3537,JHN,14,NRSV,if you love me you will keep my commandments,while i was doing this they found me in the temple completing the rite of purification without any crowd or disturbance,1
3538,JHN,14,NRSV,and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you forever,and as john was finishing his work he said what do you suppose that i am,1
3539,JHN,14,NRSV,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth,1
3540,JHN,14,NRSV,you know him because he abides with you and he will be in you,then he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles,1
3541,JHN,14,NRSV,i will not leave you orphaned i am coming to you,when king herod heard this he was frightened and all jerusalem with him and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the messiah was to be born,1
3542,JHN,14,NRSV,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers,1
3543,JHN,14,NRSV,on that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it,1
3544,JHN,14,NRSV,they who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me and those who love me will be loved by my father and i will love them and reveal myself to them,but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king,1
3545,JHN,14,NRSV,judas not iscariot said to him lord how is it that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven,1
3546,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus answered him those who love me will keep my word and my father will love them and we will come to them and make our home with them,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi,1
3547,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me,the good person brings good things out of a good treasure and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure,1
3548,JHN,14,NRSV,i have said these things to you while i am still with you,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants,1
3549,JHN,14,NRSV,but the advocate the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you,i will not leave you orphaned i am coming to you,1
3550,JHN,14,NRSV,peace i leave with you my peace i give to you,one of the two who heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother,1
3551,JHN,14,NRSV,i do not give to you as the world gives,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,1
3552,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled and do not let them be afraid,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,1
3553,JHN,14,NRSV,you heard me say to you i am going away and i am coming to you,then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean,1
3554,JHN,14,NRSV,if you loved me you would rejoice that i am going to the father because the father is greater than i,beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god for many false prophets have gone out into the world,1
3555,JHN,14,NRSV,and now i have told you this before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe,then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her children those who keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus,1
3556,JHN,14,NRSV,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison,1
3557,JHN,14,NRSV,he has no power over me but i do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that i love the father,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,1
3558,JHN,14,NRSV,rise let us be on our way,the jews answered it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you though only a human being are making yourself god,1
3559,JHN,15,NRSV,i am the true vine and my father is the vinegrower,do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit but in humility regard others as better than yourselves,1
3560,JHN,15,NRSV,he removes every branch in me that bears no fruit,his testimony is true and he knows that he tells the truth these things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled none of his bones shall be broken,1
3561,JHN,15,NRSV,every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit,james and john the sons of zebedee came forward to him and said to him teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you,1
3562,JHN,15,NRSV,you have already been cleansed by the word that i have spoken to you,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare,1
3563,JHN,15,NRSV,abide in me as i abide in you,when they could not pay he canceled the debts for both of them,1
3564,JHN,15,NRSV,just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me,she will bear a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins,1
3565,JHN,15,NRSV,i am the vine you are the branches,then he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile,1
3566,JHN,15,NRSV,those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing,then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me come i will show you the bride the wife of the lamb,1
3567,JHN,15,NRSV,whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers such branches are gathered thrown into the fire and burned,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute,1
3568,JHN,15,NRSV,if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask for whatever you wish and it will be done for you,even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever,1
3569,JHN,15,NRSV,my father is glorified by this that you bear much fruit and become my disciples,very truly i tell you before the cock crows you will have denied me three times,1
3570,JHN,15,NRSV,as the father has loved me so i have loved you abide in my love,but when they believed philip who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women,1
3571,JHN,15,NRSV,if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love,meanwhile the church throughout judea galilee and samaria had peace and was built up,1
3572,JHN,15,NRSV,i have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete,then he began to speak to them in parables,1
3573,JHN,15,NRSV,this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me,1
3574,JHN,15,NRSV,no one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends,by this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit,1
3575,JHN,15,NRSV,you are my friends if you do what i command you,i have said this to you so that in me you may have peace,1
3576,JHN,15,NRSV,i do not call you servants any longer because the servant does not know what the master is doing but i have called you friends because i have made known to you everything that i have heard from my father,while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servantgirls of the high priest came by,1
3577,JHN,15,NRSV,you did not choose me but i chose you,he disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them triumphing over them in it,1
3578,JHN,15,NRSV,and i appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last so that the father will give you whatever you ask him in my name,but you beloved build yourselves up on your most holy faith pray in the holy spirit keep yourselves in the love of god look forward to the mercy of our lord jesus christ that leads to eternal life,1
3579,JHN,15,NRSV,i am giving you these commands so that you may love one another,it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast it deceives the inhabitants of earth telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed,1
3580,JHN,15,NRSV,if the world hates you be aware that it hated me before it hated you,but how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed,1
3581,JHN,15,NRSV,if you belonged to the world the world would love you as its own,for we wanted to come to youcertainly i paul wanted to again and againbut satan blocked our way,1
3582,JHN,15,NRSV,because you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hates you,but he answered them you give them something to eat,1
3583,JHN,15,NRSV,remember the word that i said to you servants are not greater than their master,when judas his betrayer saw that jesus was condemned he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,1
3584,JHN,15,NRSV,if they persecuted me they will persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also,do not lie to one another seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator,1
3585,JHN,15,NRSV,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me,moved with pity jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him i do choose,1
3586,JHN,15,NRSV,if i had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin but now they have no excuse for their sin,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail,1
3587,JHN,15,NRSV,whoever hates me hates my father also,one day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go across to the other side of the lake,1
3588,JHN,15,NRSV,if i had not done among them the works that no one else did they would not have sin,jesus said to him friend do what you are here to do,1
3589,JHN,15,NRSV,but now they have seen and hated both me and my father,the woman answered him i have no husband,1
3590,JHN,15,NRSV,it was to fulfill the word that is written in their law they hated me without a cause,but jesus aware of this said to them why do you trouble the woman,1
3591,JHN,15,NRSV,when the advocate comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who comes from the father he will testify on my behalf,the woman said to peter you are not also one of this mans disciples are you,1
3592,JHN,15,NRSV,you also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning,james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes in the dispersion greetings,1
3593,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling,now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen,1
3594,JHN,16,NRSV,they will put you out of the synagogues,pilate asked him what is truth,1
3595,JHN,16,NRSV,indeed an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to god,god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them,1
3596,JHN,16,NRSV,and they will do this because they have not known the father or me,i have said nothing in secret,1
3597,JHN,16,NRSV,but i have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that i told you about them,a new teachingwith authority he commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him,1
3598,JHN,16,NRSV,i did not say these things to you from the beginning because i was with you,so peter went down to the men and said i am the one you are looking for what is the reason for your coming,1
3599,JHN,16,NRSV,but now i am going to him who sent me yet none of you asks me where are you going,then he put him on his own animal brought him to an inn and took care of him,1
3600,JHN,16,NRSV,but because i have said these things to you sorrow has filled your hearts,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord,1
3601,JHN,16,NRSV,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the advocate will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you,and when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you,1
3602,JHN,16,NRSV,and when he comes he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment about sin because they do not believe in me about righteousness because i am going to the father and you will see me no longer about judgment because the ruler of this world has been condemned,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,1
3603,JHN,16,NRSV,i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me,1
3604,JHN,16,NRSV,when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak on his own but will speak whatever he hears and he will declare to you the things that are to come,for if the eagerness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one hasnot according to what one does not have,1
3605,JHN,16,NRSV,he will glorify me because he will take what is mine and declare it to you,or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience,1
3606,JHN,16,NRSV,all that the father has is mine,then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done to you,1
3607,JHN,16,NRSV,for this reason i said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you,when he came to the other side to the country of the gadarenes two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him,1
3608,JHN,16,NRSV,a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me,for three months he was brought up in his fathers house and when he was abandoned pharaohs daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son,1
3609,JHN,16,NRSV,then some of his disciples said to one another what does he mean by saying to us a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me and because i am going to the father,look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces,1
3610,JHN,16,NRSV,they said what does he mean by this a little while,they also saw that jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone,1
3611,JHN,16,NRSV,we do not know what he is talking about,conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders making the most of the time,1
3612,JHN,16,NRSV,jesus knew that they wanted to ask him so he said to them are you discussing among yourselves what i meant when i said a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law,1
3613,JHN,16,NRSV,very truly i tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice you will have pain but your pain will turn into joy,then jesus said to him what do you want me to do for you,1
3614,JHN,16,NRSV,when a woman is in labor she has pain because her hour has come,but now with no further place for me in these regions i desire as i have for many years to come to you when i go to spain,1
3615,JHN,16,NRSV,but when her child is born she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world,beloved never avenge yourselves but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord,1
3616,JHN,16,NRSV,so you have pain now but i will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take your joy from you,wife for all you know you might save your husband,1
3617,JHN,16,NRSV,on that day you will ask nothing of me,jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me,1
3618,JHN,16,NRSV,very truly i tell you if you ask anything of the father in my name he will give it to you,for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness,1
3619,JHN,16,NRSV,until now you have not asked for anything in my name,as they were coming down the mountain jesus ordered them tell no one about the vision until after the son of man has been raised from the dead,1
3620,JHN,16,NRSV,ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,1
3621,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said these things to you in figures of speech,while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent word to him have nothing to do with that innocent man for today i have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him,1
3622,JHN,16,NRSV,the hour is coming when i will no longer speak to you in figures but will tell you plainly of the father,i have sent tychicus to ephesus,1
3623,JHN,16,NRSV,on that day you will ask in my name,for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of god if it begins with us what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of god,1
3624,JHN,16,NRSV,i do not say to you that i will ask the father on your behalf for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came from god,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court,1
3625,JHN,16,NRSV,i came from the father and have come into the world again i am leaving the world and am going to the father,she has done what she could she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial,1
3626,JHN,16,NRSV,his disciples said yes now you are speaking plainly not in any figure of speech now we know that you know all things and do not need to have anyone question you by this we believe that you came from god,do not be deceived my beloved,1
3627,JHN,16,NRSV,jesus answered them do you now believe,each of you must give as you have made up your mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver,1
3628,JHN,16,NRSV,the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each one to his home and you will leave me alone,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption,1
3629,JHN,16,NRSV,yet i am not alone because the father is with me,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine,1
3630,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said this to you so that in me you may have peace,for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed,1
3631,JHN,16,NRSV,in the world you face persecution,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1
3632,JHN,16,NRSV,but take courage i have conquered the world,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them,1
3633,JHN,17,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he looked up to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify your son so that the son may glorify you since you have given him authority over all people to give eternal life to all whom you have given him,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord,1
3634,JHN,17,NRSV,and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,1
3635,JHN,17,NRSV,i glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do,do we not have the right to our food and drink,1
3636,JHN,17,NRSV,so now father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that i had in your presence before the world existed,but there were some jews from asiathey ought to be here before you to make an accusation if they have anything against me,1
3637,JHN,17,NRSV,i have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven,1
3638,JHN,17,NRSV,they were yours and you gave them to me and they have kept your word,and others said it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old,1
3639,JHN,17,NRSV,now they know that everything you have given me is from you for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me,jesus knew that they wanted to ask him so he said to them are you discussing among yourselves what i meant when i said a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me,1
3640,JHN,17,NRSV,i am asking on their behalf i am not asking on behalf of the world but on behalf of those whom you gave me because they are yours,be made clean immediately his leprosy was cleansed,1
3641,JHN,17,NRSV,all mine are yours and yours are mine and i have been glorified in them,and i heard the angel of the waters say you are just o holy one who are and were for you have judged these things because they shed the blood of saints and prophets you have given them blood to drink,1
3642,JHN,17,NRSV,and now i am no longer in the world but they are in the world and i am coming to you,but turning and looking at his disciples he rebuked peter and said get behind me satan for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,1
3643,JHN,17,NRSV,holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,1
3644,JHN,17,NRSV,while i was with them i protected them in your name that you have given me,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith the lord replied if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you,1
3645,JHN,17,NRSV,i guarded them and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost so that the scripture might be fulfilled,when jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be made well,1
3646,JHN,17,NRSV,but now i am coming to you and i speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children,1
3647,JHN,17,NRSV,i have given them your word and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world,the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the lords great and glorious day,1
3648,JHN,17,NRSV,i am not asking you to take them out of the world but i ask you to protect them from the evil one,so i ask have they stumbled so as to fall,1
3649,JHN,17,NRSV,they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world,when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his relatives the israelites,1
3650,JHN,17,NRSV,sanctify them in the truth your word is truth,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it,1
3651,JHN,17,NRSV,as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world,while they were eating he took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to them and said take this is my body,1
3652,JHN,17,NRSV,and for their sakes i sanctify myself so that they also may be sanctified in truth,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name,1
3653,JHN,17,NRSV,i ask not only on behalf of these but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word that they may all be one,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword,1
3654,JHN,17,NRSV,as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me,i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you,1
3655,JHN,17,NRSV,the glory that you have given me i have given them so that they may be one as we are one i in them and you in me that they may become completely one so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me,the lord said to him get up and go to the street called straight and at the house of judas look for a man of tarsus named saul,1
3656,JHN,17,NRSV,father i desire that those also whom you have given me may be with me where i am to see my glory which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world,and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other,1
3657,JHN,17,NRSV,righteous father the world does not know you but i know you and these know that you have sent me,and someone ran filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink saying wait let us see whether elijah will come to take him down,1
3658,JHN,17,NRSV,i made your name known to them and i will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them and i in them,and get the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to celebrate,1
3659,JHN,18,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples across the kidron valley to a place where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered,it is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not mourn,1
3660,JHN,18,NRSV,now judas who betrayed him also knew the place because jesus often met there with his disciples,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again,1
3661,JHN,18,NRSV,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,1
3662,JHN,18,NRSV,then jesus knowing all that was to happen to him came forward and asked them whom are you looking for,let it be assumed that i did not burden you,1
3663,JHN,18,NRSV,judas who betrayed him was standing with them,the tribune came and asked paul tell me are you a roman citizen,1
3664,JHN,18,NRSV,when jesus said to them i am he they stepped back and fell to the ground,when the woman saw that she could not remain hidden she came trembling and falling down before him she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed,1
3665,JHN,18,NRSV,again he asked them whom are you looking for,people will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations,1
3666,JHN,18,NRSV,and they said jesus of nazareth,neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me,1
3667,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i told you that i am he,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals,1
3668,JHN,18,NRSV,so if you are looking for me let these men go,and to the angel of the church in laodicea write the words of the amen the faithful and true witness the origin of gods creation i know your works you are neither cold nor hot,1
3669,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word that he had spoken i did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town,1
3670,JHN,18,NRSV,then simon peter who had a sword drew it struck the high priests slave and cut off his right ear,suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell,1
3671,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus said to peter put your sword back into its sheath,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly,1
3672,JHN,18,NRSV,am i not to drink the cup that the father has given me,but the lord answered him and said you hypocrites does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water,1
3673,JHN,18,NRSV,so the soldiers their officer and the jewish police arrested jesus and bound him,at that moment there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the god of heaven,1
3674,JHN,18,NRSV,first they took him to annas who was the fatherinlaw of caiaphas the high priest that year,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish,1
3675,JHN,18,NRSV,caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it was better to have one person die for the people,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,1
3676,JHN,18,NRSV,simon peter and another disciple followed jesus,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,1
3677,JHN,18,NRSV,since that disciple was known to the high priest he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest but peter was standing outside at the gate,all the crowds were amazed and said can this be the son of david,1
3678,JHN,18,NRSV,so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out spoke to the woman who guarded the gate and brought peter in,but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place,1
3679,JHN,18,NRSV,the woman said to peter you are not also one of this mans disciples are you,is it not the rich who oppress you,1
3680,JHN,18,NRSV,now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing around it and warming themselves,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,1
3681,JHN,18,NRSV,peter also was standing with them and warming himself,he said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die,1
3682,JHN,18,NRSV,then the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven,1
3683,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i have spoken openly to the world i have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,1
3684,JHN,18,NRSV,i have said nothing in secret,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me,1
3685,JHN,18,NRSV,ask those who heard what i said to them they know what i said,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross,1
3686,JHN,18,NRSV,when he had said this one of the police standing nearby struck jesus on the face saying is that how you answer the high priest,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head,1
3687,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered if i have spoken wrongly testify to the wrong,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel,1
3688,JHN,18,NRSV,but if i have spoken rightly why do you strike me,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,1
3689,JHN,18,NRSV,then annas sent him bound to caiaphas the high priest,then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat,1
3690,JHN,18,NRSV,now simon peter was standing and warming himself,he it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds,1
3691,JHN,18,NRSV,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you,so i refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way,1
3692,JHN,18,NRSV,he denied it and said i am not,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1
3693,JHN,18,NRSV,one of the slaves of the high priest a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off asked did i not see you in the garden with him,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,1
3694,JHN,18,NRSV,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed,they offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain,1
3695,JHN,18,NRSV,then they took jesus from caiaphas to pilates headquarters,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night,1
3696,JHN,18,NRSV,it was early in the morning,someone told him look your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you,1
3697,JHN,18,NRSV,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover,and in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people there they shall be called children of the living god,1
3698,JHN,18,NRSV,so pilate went out to them and said what accusation do you bring against this man,do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer and then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol,1
3699,JHN,18,NRSV,they answered if this man were not a criminal we would not have handed him over to you,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped,1
3700,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1
3701,JHN,18,NRSV,the jews replied we are not permitted to put anyone to death,this he said is what you have heard from me for john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now,1
3702,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill what jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die then pilate entered the headquarters again summoned jesus and asked him are you the king of the jews,but he was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are perishing,1
3703,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered do you ask this on your own or did others tell you about me,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the one who was paralyzedi say to you stand up and take your bed and go to your home,1
3704,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate replied i am not a jew am i,therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things,1
3705,JHN,18,NRSV,your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me,and we will do this if god permits,1
3706,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered my kingdom is not from this world,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back,1
3707,JHN,18,NRSV,if my kingdom were from this world my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the jews,when they reached ephesus he left them there but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews,1
3708,JHN,18,NRSV,but as it is my kingdom is not from here,and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation,1
3709,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him so you are a king,on either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit producing its fruit each month and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations,1
3710,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered you say that i am a king,for neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything but a new creation is everything as for those who will follow this rulepeace be upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god,1
3711,JHN,18,NRSV,for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,1
3712,JHN,18,NRSV,everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice,there they gave a dinner for him,1
3713,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him what is truth,and let everyone who is thirsty come,1
3714,JHN,18,NRSV,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him,so when they had come together they asked him lord is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to israel,1
3715,JHN,18,NRSV,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover,be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life,1
3716,JHN,18,NRSV,do you want me to release for you the king of the jews,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace,1
3717,JHN,18,NRSV,they shouted in reply not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a bandit,if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die,1
3718,JHN,19,NRSV,then pilate took jesus and had him flogged,then herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared,1
3719,JHN,19,NRSV,and the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they dressed him in a purple robe,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard,1
3720,JHN,19,NRSV,they kept coming up to him saying hail king of the jews and striking him on the face,they stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes then they suddenly confronted him seized him and brought him before the council,1
3721,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate went out again and said to them look i am bringing him out to you to let you know that i find no case against him,it is by your holding fast to the word of life that i can boast on the day of christ that i did not run in vain or labor in vain,1
3722,JHN,19,NRSV,so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe,i am the root and the descendant of david the bright morning star,1
3723,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate said to them here is the man when the chief priests and the police saw him they shouted crucify him crucify him pilate said to them take him yourselves and crucify him i find no case against him,for he looked forward to the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is god,1
3724,JHN,19,NRSV,the jews answered him we have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the son of god,but those tenants said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours,1
3725,JHN,19,NRSV,now when pilate heard this he was more afraid than ever,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region,1
3726,JHN,19,NRSV,he entered his headquarters again and asked jesus where are you from,jesus said to him why do you call me good,1
3727,JHN,19,NRSV,but jesus gave him no answer,they said to him because no one has hired us,1
3728,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate therefore said to him do you refuse to speak to me,then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who lives forever and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended,1
3729,JHN,19,NRSV,do you not know that i have power to release you and power to crucify you,the natives showed us unusual kindness,1
3730,JHN,19,NRSV,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin,early in the morning he came again to the temple,1
3731,JHN,19,NRSV,from then on pilate tried to release him but the jews cried out if you release this man you are no friend of the emperor,others have labored and you have entered into their labor,1
3732,JHN,19,NRSV,everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor,we were in all two hundred seventysix persons in the ship after they had satisfied their hunger they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea,1
3733,JHN,19,NRSV,when pilate heard these words he brought jesus outside and sat on the judges bench at a place called the stone pavement or in hebrew gabbatha,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things,1
3734,JHN,19,NRSV,now it was the day of preparation for the passover and it was about noon,but philip found himself at azotus and as he was passing through the region he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to caesarea,1
3735,JHN,19,NRSV,he said to the jews here is your king they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate asked them shall i crucify your king,is not this the carpenters son,1
3736,JHN,19,NRSV,the chief priests answered we have no king but the emperor,i am sending him that is my own heart back to you,1
3737,JHN,19,NRSV,then he handed him over to them to be crucified,from noon on darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,1
3738,JHN,19,NRSV,so they took jesus and carrying the cross by himself he went out to what is called the place of the skull which in hebrew is called golgotha,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child,1
3739,JHN,19,NRSV,there they crucified him and with him two others one on either side with jesus between them,but i do know him and i keep his word,1
3740,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross,for his life is taken away from the earth,1
3741,JHN,19,NRSV,it read jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,1
3742,JHN,19,NRSV,many of the jews read this inscription because the place where jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in hebrew in latin and in greek,then judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them,1
3743,JHN,19,NRSV,then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not write the king of the jews but this man said i am king of the jews,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1
3744,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate answered what i have written i have written,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner,1
3745,JHN,19,NRSV,when the soldiers had crucified jesus they took his clothes and divided them into four parts one for each soldier,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin,1
3746,JHN,19,NRSV,they also took his tunic now the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from the top,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,1
3747,JHN,19,NRSV,so they said to one another let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see who will get it,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved,1
3748,JHN,19,NRSV,this was to fulfill what the scripture says they divided my clothes among themselves and for my clothing they cast lots,and how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard,1
3749,JHN,19,NRSV,and that is what the soldiers did,who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit,1
3750,JHN,19,NRSV,meanwhile standing near the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene,after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree,1
3751,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her he said to his mother woman here is your son,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham,1
3752,JHN,19,NRSV,then he said to the disciple here is your mother,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill,1
3753,JHN,19,NRSV,and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home,do you also want to become his disciples,1
3754,JHN,19,NRSV,after this when jesus knew that all was now finished he said in order to fulfill the scripture i am thirsty,so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs,1
3755,JHN,19,NRSV,a jar full of sour wine was standing there,those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it,1
3756,JHN,19,NRSV,so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth,if you conquer you will be clothed like them in white robes and i will not blot your name out of the book of life i will confess your name before my father and before his angels,1
3757,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus had received the wine he said it is finished,then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned,1
3758,JHN,19,NRSV,then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,1
3759,JHN,19,NRSV,since it was the day of preparation the jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity,but fornication and impurity of any kind or greed must not even be mentioned among you as is proper among saints,1
3760,JHN,19,NRSV,so they asked pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse,1
3761,JHN,19,NRSV,then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness,1
3762,JHN,19,NRSV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,there were also many lepers in israel in the time of the prophet elisha and none of them was cleansed except naaman the syrian,1
3763,JHN,19,NRSV,instead one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and at once blood and water came out,then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died,1
3764,JHN,19,NRSV,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe,for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth,1
3765,JHN,19,NRSV,his testimony is true and he knows that he tells the truth these things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled none of his bones shall be broken,and early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea,1
3766,JHN,19,NRSV,and again another passage of scripture says they will look on the one whom they have pierced,if they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind they would have had opportunity to return,1
3767,JHN,19,NRSV,after these things joseph of arimathea who was a disciple of jesus though a secret one because of his fear of the jews asked pilate to let him take away the body of jesus,i rejoice in the lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me indeed you were concerned for me but had no opportunity to show it,1
3768,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate gave him permission so he came and removed his body,when his mother mary had been engaged to joseph but before they lived together she was found to be with child from the holy spirit,1
3769,JHN,19,NRSV,nicodemus who had at first come to jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds,when it was evening he came with the twelve,1
3770,JHN,19,NRSV,they took the body of jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths according to the burial custom of the jews,when paul had laid his hands on them the holy spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied altogether there were about twelve of them,1
3771,JHN,19,NRSV,now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid,when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to god he said as for these things that you see the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another all will be thrown down,1
3772,JHN,19,NRSV,and so because it was the jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there,now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there,1
3773,JHN,20,NRSV,early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb,now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them anyone for whom they asked,1
3774,JHN,20,NRSV,so she ran and went to simon peter and the other disciple the one whom jesus loved and said to them they have taken the lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him,but he said to them unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe,1
3775,JHN,20,NRSV,then peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight,1
3776,JHN,20,NRSV,the two were running together but the other disciple outran peter and reached the tomb first,they said to her woman why are you weeping,1
3777,JHN,20,NRSV,he bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there but he did not go in,when he saw their faith he said friend your sins are forgiven you,1
3778,JHN,20,NRSV,then simon peter came following him and went into the tomb,the woman answered him i have no husband,1
3779,JHN,20,NRSV,he saw the linen wrappings lying there and the cloth that had been on jesus head not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true,1
3780,JHN,20,NRSV,then the other disciple who reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead,after there had been much debate peter stood up and said to them my brothers you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that i should be the one through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers,1
3781,JHN,20,NRSV,then the disciples returned to their homes,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith,1
3782,JHN,20,NRSV,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb,but jesus aware of their malice said why are you putting me to the test you hypocrites,1
3783,JHN,20,NRSV,as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him,1
3784,JHN,20,NRSV,they said to her woman why are you weeping,my brothers and sisters if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinners soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins,1
3785,JHN,20,NRSV,she said to them they have taken away my lord and i do not know where they have laid him,then jesus asked who touched me,1
3786,JHN,20,NRSV,when she had said this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not know that it was jesus,if i testify about myself my testimony is not true,1
3787,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan,1
3788,JHN,20,NRSV,supposing him to be the gardener she said to him sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have laid him and i will take him away,pray also for me so that when i speak a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains,1
3789,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in hebrew rabbouni which means teacher,worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy,1
3790,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her do not hold on to me because i have not yet ascended to the father,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast,1
3791,JHN,20,NRSV,but go to my brothers and say to them i am ascending to my father and your father to my god and your god,but the pharisees went out and conspired against him how to destroy him,1
3792,JHN,20,NRSV,mary magdalene went and announced to the disciples i have seen the lord and she told them that he had said these things to her,and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have obtained the requests made of him,1
3793,JHN,20,NRSV,when it was evening on that day the first day of the week and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the jews jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you,the high priest stood up and said have you no answer,1
3794,JHN,20,NRSV,after he said this he showed them his hands and his side,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised,1
3795,JHN,20,NRSV,then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the lord,do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you,1
3796,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to them again peace be with you,and i heard the number of those who were sealed one hundred fortyfour thousand sealed out of every tribe of the people of israel from the tribe of judah twelve thousand sealed from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand from the tribe of gad twelve thousand from the tribe of asher twelve thousand from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand from the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand from the tribe of levi twelve thousand from the tribe of issachar twelve thousand from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand from the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand sealed,1
3797,JHN,20,NRSV,as the father has sent me so i send you,when they heard this they were amazed and they left him and went away,1
3798,JHN,20,NRSV,when he had said this he breathed on them and said to them receive the holy spirit,this you learned from epaphras our beloved fellow servant,1
3799,JHN,20,NRSV,if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven them if you retain the sins of any they are retained,some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another not made with hands,1
3800,JHN,20,NRSV,but thomas who was called the twin one of the twelve was not with them when jesus came,let marriage be held in honor by all and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled for god will judge fornicators and adulterers,1
3801,JHN,20,NRSV,so the other disciples told him we have seen the lord,likewise just as it was in the days of lot they were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building but on the day that lot left sodom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them it will be like that on the day that the son of man is revealed,1
3802,JHN,20,NRSV,but he said to them unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe,the natives showed us unusual kindness,1
3803,JHN,20,NRSV,a week later his disciples were again in the house and thomas was with them,and how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent,1
3804,JHN,20,NRSV,although the doors were shut jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you,have you come here to torment us before the time,1
3805,JHN,20,NRSV,then he said to thomas put your finger here and see my hands,when i remember you in my prayers i always thank my god because i hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the lord jesus,1
3806,JHN,20,NRSV,reach out your hand and put it in my side,this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die,1
3807,JHN,20,NRSV,thomas answered him my lord and my god jesus said to him have you believed because you have seen me,when his parents saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him child why have you treated us like this,1
3808,JHN,20,NRSV,blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe,for this reason the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he was not only breaking the sabbath but was also calling god his own father thereby making himself equal to god,1
3809,JHN,20,NRSV,now jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book,accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive,1
3810,JHN,20,NRSV,but these are written so that you may come to believe that jesus is the messiah the son of god and that through believing you may have life in his name,but they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke,1
3811,JHN,21,NRSV,after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the sea of tiberias and he showed himself in this way,he said then father i beg you to send him to my fathers house for i have five brothersthat he may warn them so that they will not also come into this place of torment,1
3812,JHN,21,NRSV,gathered there together were simon peter thomas called the twin nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples,as he entered a village ten lepers approached him,1
3813,JHN,21,NRSV,simon peter said to them i am going fishing,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection,1
3814,JHN,21,NRSV,they said to him we will go with you,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first,1
3815,JHN,21,NRSV,they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you,1
3816,JHN,21,NRSV,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus,once more they said hallelujah the smoke goes up from her forever and ever,1
3817,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them children you have no fish have you,for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from fornication that each one of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor not with lustful passion like the gentiles who do not know god that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister in this matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you,1
3818,JHN,21,NRSV,they answered him no he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some,while jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them on the way see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified and on the third day he will be raised,1
3819,JHN,21,NRSV,so they cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son,1
3820,JHN,21,NRSV,that disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord when simon peter heard that it was the lord he put on some clothes for he was naked and jumped into the sea,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me,1
3821,JHN,21,NRSV,but the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not far from the land only about a hundred yards off,he would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating and no one gave him anything,1
3822,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had gone ashore they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and bread,and if your foot causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell,1
3823,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them bring some of the fish that you have just caught,but these have no root they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away,1
3824,JHN,21,NRSV,so simon peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish a hundred fiftythree of them and though there were so many the net was not torn,they said it is his angel,1
3825,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them come and have breakfast,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place,1
3826,JHN,21,NRSV,now none of the disciples dared to ask him who are you,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,1
3827,JHN,21,NRSV,because they knew it was the lord,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him,1
3828,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish,this agrees with the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and i will rebuild the dwelling of david which has fallen from its ruins i will rebuild it and i will set it up so that all other peoples may seek the lord even all the gentiles over whom my name has been called,1
3829,JHN,21,NRSV,this was now the third time that jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead,each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor,1
3830,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had finished breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit that dwells in you,1
3831,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us give thanks by which we offer to god an acceptable worship with reverence and awe for indeed our god is a consuming fire,1
3832,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him feed my lambs,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me,1
3833,JHN,21,NRSV,a second time he said to him simon son of john do you love me,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus,1
3834,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am expecting him with the brothers,1
3835,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him tend my sheep,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear,1
3836,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,1
3837,JHN,21,NRSV,peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time do you love me,he answered i will not but later he changed his mind and went,1
3838,JHN,21,NRSV,and he said to him lord you know everything you know that i love you,for this reason god gave them up to degrading passions,1
3839,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him feed my sheep,now send men to joppa for a certain simon who is called peter he is lodging with simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside,1
3840,JHN,21,NRSV,very truly i tell you when you were younger you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished,and when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god made you alive together with him when he forgave us all our trespasses erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands,1
3841,JHN,21,NRSV,but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself,1
3842,JHN,21,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify god after this he said to him follow me,show me the coin used for the tax,1
3843,JHN,21,NRSV,peter turned and saw the disciple whom jesus loved following them he was the one who had reclined next to jesus at the supper and had said lord who is it that is going to betray you,and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one buys their cargo anymore cargo of gold silver jewels and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet all kinds of scented wood all articles of ivory all articles of costly wood bronze iron and marble cinnamon spice incense myrrh frankincense wine olive oil choice flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and chariots slavesand human lives,1
3844,JHN,21,NRSV,when peter saw him he said to jesus lord what about him,do not lord it over those in your charge but be examples to the flock,1
3845,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,but he did not answer her at all,1
3846,JHN,21,NRSV,follow me so the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die,the one who comes from above is above all the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things,1
3847,JHN,21,NRSV,yet jesus did not say to him that he would not die but if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,i appeal to you then be imitators of me,1
3848,JHN,21,NRSV,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1
3849,JHN,21,NRSV,but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written,when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the body to joseph,1
3850,ACT,1,NRSV,in the first book theophilus i wrote about all that jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the holy spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,i have done no wrong to the jews as you very well know,1
3851,ACT,1,NRSV,after his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of god,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus,1
3852,ACT,1,NRSV,while staying with them he ordered them not to leave jerusalem but to wait there for the promise of the father,to one is given through the spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the one spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another the discernment of spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues,1
3853,ACT,1,NRSV,this he said is what you have heard from me for john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now,jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness where for forty days he was tempted by the devil,1
3854,ACT,1,NRSV,so when they had come together they asked him lord is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to israel,as to the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we beg you brothers and sisters not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by spirit or by word or by letter as though from us to the effect that the day of the lord is already here,1
3855,ACT,1,NRSV,he replied it is not for you to know the times or periods that the father has set by his own authority,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace,1
3856,ACT,1,NRSV,but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,1
3857,ACT,1,NRSV,when he had said this as they were watching he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight,they asked him who is the man who said to you take it up and walk,1
3858,ACT,1,NRSV,while he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven suddenly two men in white robes stood by them,i was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth just as we have been commanded by the father,1
3859,ACT,1,NRSV,they said men of galilee why do you stand looking up toward heaven,he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire,1
3860,ACT,1,NRSV,this jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,1
3861,ACT,1,NRSV,then they returned to jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is near jerusalem a sabbath days journey away,a great number of people would also gather from the towns around jerusalem bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits and they were all cured,1
3862,ACT,1,NRSV,when they had entered the city they went to the room upstairs where they were staying peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas son of james,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming,1
3863,ACT,1,NRSV,all these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer together with certain women including mary the mother of jesus as well as his brothers,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done,1
3864,ACT,1,NRSV,in those days peter stood up among the believers together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons and said friends the scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy spirit through david foretold concerning judas who became a guide for those who arrested jesus for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry,this man is performing many signs,1
3865,ACT,1,NRSV,now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out,fearing that we might run on the rocks they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come,1
3866,ACT,1,NRSV,this became known to all the residents of jerusalem so that the field was called in their language hakeldama that is field of blood for it is written in the book of psalms let his homestead become desolate and let there be no one to live in it and let another take his position of overseer,he called out father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in agony in these flames,1
3867,ACT,1,NRSV,so one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john until the day when he was taken up from usone of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1
3868,ACT,1,NRSV,so they proposed two joseph called barsabbas who was also known as justus and matthias,when it grew late his disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now very late send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy something for themselves to eat,1
3869,ACT,1,NRSV,then they prayed and said lord you know everyones heart,but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood selfcondemned for until certain people came from james he used to eat with the gentiles,1
3870,ACT,1,NRSV,show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which judas turned aside to go to his own place,then he called the crowd to him and said to them listen and understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles,1
3871,ACT,1,NRSV,and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on matthias and he was added to the eleven apostles,now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways,1
3872,ACT,2,NRSV,when the day of pentecost had come they were all together in one place,and others are those sown among the thorns these are the ones who hear the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word and it yields nothing,1
3873,ACT,2,NRSV,and suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished,1
3874,ACT,2,NRSV,divided tongues as of fire appeared among them and a tongue rested on each of them,see i am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves,1
3875,ACT,2,NRSV,all of them were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other languages as the spirit gave them ability,and remember i am with you always to the end of the age,1
3876,ACT,2,NRSV,now there were devout jews from every nation under heaven living in jerusalem,others to test him kept demanding from him a sign from heaven,1
3877,ACT,2,NRSV,and at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,1
3878,ACT,2,NRSV,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,for i am not ashamed of the gospel it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and also to the greek,1
3879,ACT,2,NRSV,and how is it that we hear each of us in our own native language,we have become like the rubbish of the world the dregs of all things to this very day,1
3880,ACT,2,NRSV,parthians medes elamites and residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya belonging to cyrene and visitors from rome both jews and proselytes cretans and arabsin our own languages we hear them speaking about gods deeds of power,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly,1
3881,ACT,2,NRSV,all were amazed and perplexed saying to one another what does this mean,if there is anything further you want to know it must be settled in the regular assembly,1
3882,ACT,2,NRSV,but others sneered and said they are filled with new wine,he abolishes the first in order to establish the second,1
3883,ACT,2,NRSV,but peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them men of judea and all who live in jerusalem let this be known to you and listen to what i say,then he said the god of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will to see the righteous one and to hear his own voice for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard,1
3884,ACT,2,NRSV,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning,and whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him,1
3885,ACT,2,NRSV,no this is what was spoken through the prophet joel in the last days it will be god declares that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams,when he returned having received royal power he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading,1
3886,ACT,2,NRSV,even upon my slaves both men and women in those days i will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy,for the same reason you also pay taxes for the authorities are gods servants busy with this very thing,1
3887,ACT,2,NRSV,and i will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below blood and fire and smoky mist,for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family,1
3888,ACT,2,NRSV,the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the lords great and glorious day,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain,1
3889,ACT,2,NRSV,then everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning,1
3890,ACT,2,NRSV,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,1
3891,ACT,2,NRSV,but god raised him up having freed him from death because it was impossible for him to be held in its power,and he was transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became dazzling white,1
3892,ACT,2,NRSV,for david says concerning him i saw the lord always before me for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced moreover my flesh will live in hope,while they were going some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened,1
3893,ACT,2,NRSV,for you will not abandon my soul to hades or let your holy one experience corruption,then the spirit said to philip go over to this chariot and join it,1
3894,ACT,2,NRSV,you have made known to me the ways of life you will make me full of gladness with your presence,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this,1
3895,ACT,2,NRSV,fellow israelites i may say to you confidently of our ancestor david that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day,so take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents,1
3896,ACT,2,NRSV,since he was a prophet he knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne,grace be with all who have an undying love for our lord jesus christ,1
3897,ACT,2,NRSV,foreseeing this david spoke of the resurrection of the messiah saying he was not abandoned to hades nor did his flesh experience corruption,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good,1
3898,ACT,2,NRSV,this jesus god raised up and of that all of us are witnesses,but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did and heard the children crying out in the temple hosanna to the son of david they became angry and said to him do you hear what these are saying,1
3899,ACT,2,NRSV,being therefore exalted at the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured out this that you both see and hear,for to this end we toil and struggle because we have our hope set on the living god who is the savior of all people especially of those who believe,1
3900,ACT,2,NRSV,for david did not ascend into the heavens but he himself says the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool,whoever speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come,1
3901,ACT,2,NRSV,therefore let the entire house of israel know with certainty that god has made him both lord and messiah this jesus whom you crucified,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit,1
3902,ACT,2,NRSV,now when they heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and to the other apostles brothers what should we do,the pharisees said to him look why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,1
3903,ACT,2,NRSV,peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ so that your sins may be forgiven and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit,to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,1
3904,ACT,2,NRSV,for the promise is for you for your children and for all who are far away everyone whom the lord our god calls to him,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,1
3905,ACT,2,NRSV,and he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them saying save yourselves from this corrupt generation,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is from god so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by god,1
3906,ACT,2,NRSV,so those who welcomed his message were baptized and that day about three thousand persons were added,but these have no root they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away,1
3907,ACT,2,NRSV,they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers,very truly i tell you if you ask anything of the father in my name he will give it to you,1
3908,ACT,2,NRSV,awe came upon everyone because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles,then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called cyrenians alexandrians and others of those from cilicia and asia stood up and argued with stephen,1
3909,ACT,2,NRSV,all who believed were together and had all things in common they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all as any had need,moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law that the person who does these things will live by them,1
3910,ACT,2,NRSV,day by day as they spent much time together in the temple they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts praising god and having the goodwill of all the people,now the son of pauls sister heard about the ambush so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told paul,1
3911,ACT,2,NRSV,and day by day the lord added to their number those who were being saved,the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for fortytwo months,1
3912,ACT,3,NRSV,one day peter and john were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer at three oclock in the afternoon,but i have this against you you tolerate that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophet and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice fornication and to eat food sacrificed to idols,1
3913,ACT,3,NRSV,and a man lame from birth was being carried in,i have been paid in full and have more than enough i am fully satisfied now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to god,1
3914,ACT,3,NRSV,people would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the beautiful gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes,1
3915,ACT,3,NRSV,when he saw peter and john about to go into the temple he asked them for alms,and now listenthe hand of the lord is against you and you will be blind for a while unable to see the sun,1
3916,ACT,3,NRSV,peter looked intently at him as did john and said look at us,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,1
3917,ACT,3,NRSV,and he fixed his attention on them expecting to receive something from them,then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them mastered them all and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded,1
3918,ACT,3,NRSV,but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk,because the residents of jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath they fulfilled those words by condemning him,1
3919,ACT,3,NRSV,and he took him by the right hand and raised him up and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong,indeed i would rather die than thatno one will deprive me of my ground for boasting if i proclaim the gospel this gives me no ground for boasting for an obligation is laid on me and woe to me if i do not proclaim the gospel for if i do this of my own will i have a reward but if not of my own will i am entrusted with a commission,1
3920,ACT,3,NRSV,jumping up he stood and began to walk and he entered the temple with them walking and leaping and praising god,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,1
3921,ACT,3,NRSV,all the people saw him walking and praising god and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts,1
3922,ACT,3,NRSV,while he clung to peter and john all the people ran together to them in the portico called solomons portico utterly astonished,but he turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,1
3923,ACT,3,NRSV,when peter saw it he addressed the people you israelites why do you wonder at this or why do you stare at us as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,1
3924,ACT,3,NRSV,the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob the god of our ancestors has glorified his servant jesus whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of pilate though he had decided to release him,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals,1
3925,ACT,3,NRSV,but you rejected the holy and righteous one and asked to have a murderer given to you and you killed the author of life whom god raised from the dead,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction and there are many who take it,1
3926,ACT,3,NRSV,and by faith in his name his name itself has made this man strong whom you see and know and the faith that is through jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you,and he answered them go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news brought to them,1
3927,ACT,3,NRSV,and now friends i know that you acted in ignorance as did also your rulers,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith,1
3928,ACT,3,NRSV,in this way god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets that his messiah would suffer,but the other nine where are they,1
3929,ACT,3,NRSV,repent therefore and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the lord and that he may send the messiah appointed for you that is jesus who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that god announced long ago through his holy prophets,the circumcised believers who had come with peter were astounded that the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on the gentiles for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling god,1
3930,ACT,3,NRSV,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me,then i looked and there was a white cloud and seated on the cloud was one like the son of man with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand another angel came out of the temple calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud use your sickle and reap for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe,1
3931,ACT,3,NRSV,you must listen to whatever he tells you,do i say this on human authority,1
3932,ACT,3,NRSV,and it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people,for they could not endure the order that was given if even an animal touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death,1
3933,ACT,3,NRSV,and all the prophets as many as have spoken from samuel and those after him also predicted these days,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,1
3934,ACT,3,NRSV,you are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that god gave to your ancestors saying to abraham and in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed,when jesus saw the crowds he went up the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him,1
3935,ACT,3,NRSV,when god raised up his servant he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways,he looked around at them with anger he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man stretch out your hand,1
3936,ACT,4,NRSV,while peter and john were speaking to the people the priests the captain of the temple and the sadducees came to them much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in jesus there is the resurrection of the dead,what good is it my brothers and sisters if you say you have faith but do not have works,1
3937,ACT,4,NRSV,so they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening,all who believed were together and had all things in common they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all as any had need,1
3938,ACT,4,NRSV,but many of those who heard the word believed and they numbered about five thousand,at last two came forward and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days,1
3939,ACT,4,NRSV,the next day their rulers elders and scribes assembled in jerusalem with annas the high priest caiaphas john and alexander and all who were of the highpriestly family,he went into all the region around the jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet isaiah the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1
3940,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had made the prisoners stand in their midst they inquired by what power or by what name did you do this,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the lords favor,1
3941,ACT,4,NRSV,then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them rulers of the people and elders if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed let it be known to all of you and to all the people of israel that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead,when a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him he said in a parable a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell on the path and was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up,1
3942,ACT,4,NRSV,this jesus is the stone that was rejected by you the builders it has become the cornerstone,what i say to you in the dark tell in the light and what you hear whispered proclaim from the housetops,1
3943,ACT,4,NRSV,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,by no means do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness,1
3944,ACT,4,NRSV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were amazed and recognized them as companions of jesus,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1
3945,ACT,4,NRSV,when they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,1
3946,ACT,4,NRSV,so they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them,1
3947,ACT,4,NRSV,they said what will we do with them,take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter have nothing to do with them so that they may be ashamed,1
3948,ACT,4,NRSV,for it is obvious to all who live in jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them we cannot deny it,now after john was arrested jesus came to galilee proclaiming the good news of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe in the good news,1
3949,ACT,4,NRSV,but to keep it from spreading further among the people let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name,the people kept shouting the voice of a god and not of a mortal and immediately because he had not given the glory to god an angel of the lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died,1
3950,ACT,4,NRSV,so they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus,he must never drink wine or strong drink even before his birth he will be filled with the holy spirit,1
3951,ACT,4,NRSV,but peter and john answered them whether it is right in gods sight to listen to you rather than to god you must judge for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,1
3952,ACT,4,NRSV,after threatening them again they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for all of them praised god for what had happened,many samaritans from that city believed in him because of the womans testimony he told me everything i have ever done,1
3953,ACT,4,NRSV,for the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old,but he said lord first let me go and bury my father,1
3954,ACT,4,NRSV,after they were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them,but i have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that i told you about them,1
3955,ACT,4,NRSV,when they heard it they raised their voices together to god and said sovereign lord who made the heaven and the earth the sea and everything in them it is you who said by the holy spirit through our ancestor david your servant why did the gentiles rage and the peoples imagine vain things,he went and beheaded him in the prison brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl,1
3956,ACT,4,NRSV,the kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers have gathered together against the lord and against his messiah,confident of your obedience i am writing to you knowing that you will do even more than i say,1
3957,ACT,4,NRSV,for in this city in fact both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the peoples of israel gathered together against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place,then he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man and you will not see it,1
3958,ACT,4,NRSV,and now lord look at their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant jesus,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart,1
3959,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god with boldness,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account,1
3960,ACT,4,NRSV,now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions but everything they owned was held in common,likewise urge the younger men to be selfcontrolled,1
3961,ACT,4,NRSV,with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all,jesus answered them did i not choose you the twelve,1
3962,ACT,4,NRSV,there was not a needy person among them for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold,remember the word that i said to you servants are not greater than their master,1
3963,ACT,4,NRSV,they laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like,1
3964,ACT,4,NRSV,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,and you who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,1
3965,ACT,4,NRSV,he sold a field that belonged to him then brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet,the god of peace will shortly crush satan under your feet,1
3966,ACT,5,NRSV,but a man named ananias with the consent of his wife sapphira sold a piece of property with his wifes knowledge he kept back some of the proceeds and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet,he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness,1
3967,ACT,5,NRSV,ananias peter asked why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land,set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god,1
3968,ACT,5,NRSV,while it remained unsold did it not remain your own,but an opportunity came when herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of galilee,1
3969,ACT,5,NRSV,and after it was sold were not the proceeds at your disposal,the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegrooms voice,1
3970,ACT,5,NRSV,how is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he,1
3971,ACT,5,NRSV,you did not lie to us but to god now when ananias heard these words he fell down and died,paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand,1
3972,ACT,5,NRSV,and great fear seized all who heard of it,let anyone with ears to hear listen,1
3973,ACT,5,NRSV,the young men came and wrapped up his body then carried him out and buried him,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs,1
3974,ACT,5,NRSV,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened,do your best to present yourself to god as one approved by him a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly explaining the word of truth,1
3975,ACT,5,NRSV,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price,but some believers who belonged to the sect of the pharisees stood up and said it is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of moses,1
3976,ACT,5,NRSV,and she said yes that was the price,those conflicts and disputes among you where do they come from,1
3977,ACT,5,NRSV,then peter said to her how is it that you have agreed together to put the spirit of the lord to the test,but immediately jesus spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid,1
3978,ACT,5,NRSV,look the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out,john to the seven churches that are in asia grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits who are before his throne and from jesus christ the faithful witness the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth,1
3979,ACT,5,NRSV,immediately she fell down at his feet and died,as he went the crowds pressed in on him,1
3980,ACT,5,NRSV,when the young men came in they found her dead so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband,then the manager said to himself what will i do now that my master is taking the position away from me,1
3981,ACT,5,NRSV,and great fear seized the whole church and all who heard of these things,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect,1
3982,ACT,5,NRSV,now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles,false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to lead astray if possible the elect,1
3983,ACT,5,NRSV,and they were all together in solomons portico,we sailed from there and on the following day we arrived opposite chios,1
3984,ACT,5,NRSV,none of the rest dared to join them but the people held them in high esteem,if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town,1
3985,ACT,5,NRSV,yet more than ever believers were added to the lord great numbers of both men and women so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats in order that peters shadow might fall on some of them as he came by,but he said to them my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it,1
3986,ACT,5,NRSV,a great number of people would also gather from the towns around jerusalem bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits and they were all cured,he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out,1
3987,ACT,5,NRSV,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison,now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them this question what do you think of the messiah,1
3988,ACT,5,NRSV,but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison doors brought them out and said go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life,but they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his business while the rest seized his slaves mistreated them and killed them,1
3989,ACT,5,NRSV,when they heard this they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching,but they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead,1
3990,ACT,5,NRSV,when the high priest and those with him arrived they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor,1
3991,ACT,5,NRSV,but when the temple police went there they did not find them in the prison so they returned and reported we found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside,and after the deportation to babylon jechoniah was the father of salathiel and salathiel the father of zerubbabel and zerubbabel the father of abiud and abiud the father of eliakim and eliakim the father of azor and azor the father of zadok and zadok the father of achim and achim the father of eliud and eliud the father of eleazar and eleazar the father of matthan and matthan the father of jacob and jacob the father of joseph the husband of mary of whom jesus was born who is called the messiah,1
3992,ACT,5,NRSV,now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were perplexed about them wondering what might be going on,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come,1
3993,ACT,5,NRSV,then someone arrived and announced look the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people then the captain went with the temple police and brought them but without violence for they were afraid of being stoned by the people,wives be subject to your husbands as is fitting in the lord,1
3994,ACT,5,NRSV,when they had brought them they had them stand before the council,after sternly warning him he sent him away at once saying to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what moses commanded as a testimony to them,1
3995,ACT,5,NRSV,the high priest questioned them saying we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name yet here you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this mans blood on us,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,1
3996,ACT,5,NRSV,but peter and the apostles answered we must obey god rather than any human authority,rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you,1
3997,ACT,5,NRSV,the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree,so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god,1
3998,ACT,5,NRSV,god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins,and they were afraid to ask him about this saying,1
3999,ACT,5,NRSV,and we are witnesses to these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him,in appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle,1
4000,ACT,5,NRSV,when they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that,1
4001,ACT,5,NRSV,but a pharisee in the council named gamaliel a teacher of the law respected by all the people stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time,they profess to know god but they deny him by their actions,1
4002,ACT,5,NRSV,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john who testified to the word of god and to the testimony of jesus christ even to all that he saw,1
4003,ACT,5,NRSV,for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him but he was killed and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared,you are indeed doing what your father does,1
4004,ACT,5,NRSV,after him judas the galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him he also perished and all who followed him were scattered,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1
4005,ACT,5,NRSV,so in the present case i tell you keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow themin that case you may even be found fighting against god they were convinced by him and when they had called in the apostles they had them flogged,he said to them where is your faith,1
4006,ACT,5,NRSV,then they ordered them not to speak in the name of jesus and let them go,the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john who testified to the word of god and to the testimony of jesus christ even to all that he saw,1
4007,ACT,5,NRSV,as they left the council they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name,but do not ignore this one fact beloved that with the lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day,1
4008,ACT,5,NRSV,and every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim jesus as the messiah,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them,1
4009,ACT,6,NRSV,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food,it was indeed written for our sake for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop,1
4010,ACT,6,NRSV,and the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said it is not right that we should neglect the word of god in order to wait on tables,then they asked him why do the scribes say that elijah must come first,1
4011,ACT,6,NRSV,therefore friends select from among yourselves seven men of good standing full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint to this task while we for our part will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts,1
4012,ACT,6,NRSV,what they said pleased the whole community and they chose stephen a man full of faith and the holy spirit together with philip prochorus nicanor timon parmenas and nicolaus a proselyte of antioch,the prayer of faith will save the sick and the lord will raise them up and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven,1
4013,ACT,6,NRSV,they had these men stand before the apostles who prayed and laid their hands on them,remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with them those who are being tortured as though you yourselves were being tortured,1
4014,ACT,6,NRSV,the word of god continued to spread the number of the disciples increased greatly in jerusalem and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith,at the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited come for everything is ready now,1
4015,ACT,6,NRSV,stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people,truly i tell you no sign will be given to this generation,1
4016,ACT,6,NRSV,then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called cyrenians alexandrians and others of those from cilicia and asia stood up and argued with stephen,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living,1
4017,ACT,6,NRSV,but they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke,god remembered great babylon and gave her the winecup of the fury of his wrath,1
4018,ACT,6,NRSV,then they secretly instigated some men to say we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god,he must not be a recent convert or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil,1
4019,ACT,6,NRSV,they stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes then they suddenly confronted him seized him and brought him before the council,the next day we left and came to caesarea and we went into the house of philip the evangelist one of the seven and stayed with him,1
4020,ACT,6,NRSV,they set up false witnesses who said this man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that moses handed on to us,but when the tenants saw him they discussed it among themselves and said this is the heir let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours,1
4021,ACT,6,NRSV,and all who sat in the council looked intently at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel,then simon peter who had a sword drew it struck the high priests slave and cut off his right ear,1
4022,ACT,7,NRSV,then the high priest asked him are these things so,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,1
4023,ACT,7,NRSV,and stephen replied brothers and fathers listen to me,the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become a loaf of bread,1
4024,ACT,7,NRSV,the god of glory appeared to our ancestor abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he lived in haran and said to him leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that i will show you,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,1
4025,ACT,7,NRSV,then he left the country of the chaldeans and settled in haran,whoever comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty,1
4026,ACT,7,NRSV,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living,now they had been sent from the pharisees,1
4027,ACT,7,NRSV,he did not give him any of it as a heritage not even a foots length but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him even though he had no child,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him,1
4028,ACT,7,NRSV,and god spoke in these terms that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years,although you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy for you are receiving the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls,1
4029,ACT,7,NRSV,but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place,then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach,1
4030,ACT,7,NRSV,then he gave him the covenant of circumcision,but if you do what is wrong you should be afraid for the authority does not bear the sword in vain it is the servant of god to execute wrath on the wrongdoer,1
4031,ACT,7,NRSV,and so abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day and isaac became the father of jacob and jacob of the twelve patriarchs,now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over stephen traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch and they spoke the word to no one except jews,1
4032,ACT,7,NRSV,the patriarchs jealous of joseph sold him into egypt but god was with him and rescued him from all his afflictions and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt who appointed him ruler over egypt and over all his household,as he taught he said beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers,1
4033,ACT,7,NRSV,now there came a famine throughout egypt and canaan and great suffering and our ancestors could find no food,as was the man of dust so are those who are of the dust and as is the man of heaven so are those who are of heaven,1
4034,ACT,7,NRSV,but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent our ancestors there on their first visit,after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and for five months she remained in seclusion,1
4035,ACT,7,NRSV,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught,1
4036,ACT,7,NRSV,then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventyfive in all so jacob went down to egypt,therefore do not be associated with them,1
4037,ACT,7,NRSV,he himself died there as well as our ancestors and their bodies were brought back to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem,he answered him you say so,1
4038,ACT,7,NRSV,but as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that god had made to abraham our people in egypt increased and multiplied until another king who had not known joseph ruled over egypt,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord,1
4039,ACT,7,NRSV,he dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die,no one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light,1
4040,ACT,7,NRSV,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god,because the residents of jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath they fulfilled those words by condemning him,1
4041,ACT,7,NRSV,for three months he was brought up in his fathers house and when he was abandoned pharaohs daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi,1
4042,ACT,7,NRSV,so moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it,1
4043,ACT,7,NRSV,when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his relatives the israelites,and the chains fell off his wrists,1
4044,ACT,7,NRSV,when he saw one of them being wronged he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the egyptian,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin,1
4045,ACT,7,NRSV,he supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that god through him was rescuing them but they did not understand,so they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard,1
4046,ACT,7,NRSV,the next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them saying men you are brothers why do you wrong each other,while staying with them he ordered them not to leave jerusalem but to wait there for the promise of the father,1
4047,ACT,7,NRSV,but the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed moses aside saying who made you a ruler and a judge over us,for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life,1
4048,ACT,7,NRSV,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday,so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily,1
4049,ACT,7,NRSV,when he heard this moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of midian,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way,1
4050,ACT,7,NRSV,there he became the father of two sons,shun fornication every sin that a person commits is outside the body but the fornicator sins against the body itself,1
4051,ACT,7,NRSV,now when forty years had passed an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in the flame of a burning bush,have you come here to torment us before the time,1
4052,ACT,7,NRSV,when moses saw it he was amazed at the sight and as he approached to look there came the voice of the lord i am the god of your ancestors the god of abraham isaac and jacob,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son,1
4053,ACT,7,NRSV,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,for by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified,1
4054,ACT,7,NRSV,then the lord said to him take off the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground,may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers and sisters,1
4055,ACT,7,NRSV,i have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in egypt and have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them,but jesus called them to him and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them,1
4056,ACT,7,NRSV,come now i will send you to egypt,all of them condemned him as deserving death,1
4057,ACT,7,NRSV,it was this moses whom they rejected when they said who made you a ruler and a judge,you have made them for a little while lower than the angels you have crowned them with glory and honor subjecting all things under their feet,1
4058,ACT,7,NRSV,and whom god now sent as both ruler and liberator through the angel who appeared to him in the bush,and ought not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day,1
4059,ACT,7,NRSV,he led them out having performed wonders and signs in egypt at the red sea and in the wilderness for forty years,i want you to know that our brother timothy has been set free and if he comes in time he will be with me when i see you,1
4060,ACT,7,NRSV,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret,1
4061,ACT,7,NRSV,he is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at mount sinai and with our ancestors and he received living oracles to give to us,therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god,1
4062,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors were unwilling to obey him instead they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to egypt saying to aaron make gods for us who will lead the way for us as for this moses who led us out from the land of egypt we do not know what has happened to him,by these three plagues a third of humankind was killed by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths,1
4063,ACT,7,NRSV,at that time they made a calf offered a sacrifice to the idol and reveled in the works of their hands,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,1
4064,ACT,7,NRSV,but god turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness o house of israel,i warned those who sinned previously and all the others and i warn them now while absent as i did when present on my second visit that if i come again i will not be lenient since you desire proof that christ is speaking in me,1
4065,ACT,7,NRSV,no you took along the tent of moloch and the star of your god rephan the images that you made to worship so i will remove you beyond babylon,conduct yourselves honorably among the gentiles so that though they malign you as evildoers they may see your honorable deeds and glorify god when he comes to judge,1
4066,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen,but they all alike began to make excuses,1
4067,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors in turn brought it in with joshua when they dispossessed the nations that god drove out before our ancestors,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work,1
4068,ACT,7,NRSV,and it was there until the time of david who found favor with god and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of jacob,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man,1
4069,ACT,7,NRSV,but it was solomon who built a house for him,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me and i in them,1
4070,ACT,7,NRSV,yet the most high does not dwell in houses made with human hands as the prophet says heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool,if i am not an apostle to others at least i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord,1
4071,ACT,7,NRSV,what kind of house will you build for me says the lord or what is the place of my rest,when he went out again about noon and about three oclock he did the same,1
4072,ACT,7,NRSV,did not my hand make all these things,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire,1
4073,ACT,7,NRSV,you stiffnecked people uncircumcised in heart and ears you are forever opposing the holy spirit just as your ancestors used to do,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter,1
4074,ACT,7,NRSV,which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute,pilate therefore said to him do you refuse to speak to me,1
4075,ACT,7,NRSV,they killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one and now you have become his betrayers and murderers,you gave me no kiss but from the time i came in she has not stopped kissing my feet,1
4076,ACT,7,NRSV,you are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels and yet you have not kept it,he brought paul down and had him stand before them,1
4077,ACT,7,NRSV,when they heard these things they became enraged and ground their teeth at stephen,let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift,1
4078,ACT,7,NRSV,but filled with the holy spirit he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first,1
4079,ACT,7,NRSV,look he said i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god but they covered their ears and with a loud shout all rushed together against him,and to the angel of the church in sardis write these are the words of him who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know your works you have a name of being alive but you are dead,1
4080,ACT,7,NRSV,then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named saul,he answered the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash,1
4081,ACT,7,NRSV,while they were stoning stephen he prayed lord jesus receive my spirit,then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them come up here and they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them,1
4082,ACT,7,NRSV,then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them,and he said let anyone with ears to hear listen when he was alone those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables,1
4083,ACT,7,NRSV,when he had said this he died,moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy,1
4084,ACT,8,NRSV,and saul approved of their killing him,it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast it deceives the inhabitants of earth telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed,1
4085,ACT,8,NRSV,that day a severe persecution began against the church in jerusalem and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of judea and samaria,and i will show you a still more excellent way,1
4086,ACT,8,NRSV,devout men buried stephen and made loud lamentation over him,because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him,1
4087,ACT,8,NRSV,but saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house dragging off both men and women he committed them to prison,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him,1
4088,ACT,8,NRSV,now those who were scattered went from place to place proclaiming the word,these are the only ones of the circumcision among my coworkers for the kingdom of god and they have been a comfort to me,1
4089,ACT,8,NRSV,philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed the messiah to them,then jesus came from galilee to john at the jordan to be baptized by him,1
4090,ACT,8,NRSV,the crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by philip hearing and seeing the signs that he did for unclean spirits crying with loud shrieks came out of many who were possessed and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured,anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized,1
4091,ACT,8,NRSV,so there was great joy in that city,and leaving the crowd behind they took him with them in the boat just as he was,1
4092,ACT,8,NRSV,now a certain man named simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of samaria saying that he was someone great,for just as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster so for three days and three nights the son of man will be in the heart of the earth,1
4093,ACT,8,NRSV,all of them from the least to the greatest listened to him eagerly saying this man is the power of god that is called great,his eyes are like a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems and he has a name inscribed that no one knows but himself,1
4094,ACT,8,NRSV,and they listened eagerly to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic,now write what you have seen what is and what is to take place after this,1
4095,ACT,8,NRSV,but when they believed philip who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women,but timothys worth you know how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel,1
4096,ACT,8,NRSV,after being baptized he stayed constantly with philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place,these are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast they will make war on the lamb and the lamb will conquer them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those with him are called and chosen and faithful,1
4097,ACT,8,NRSV,now when the apostles at jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them,greet also the church in their house,1
4098,ACT,8,NRSV,the two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit for as yet the spirit had not come upon any of them they had only been baptized in the name of the lord jesus,and as isaiah predicted if the lord of hosts had not left survivors to us we would have fared like sodom and been made like gomorrah,1
4099,ACT,8,NRSV,then peter and john laid their hands on them and they received the holy spirit,as for you the anointing that you received from him abides in you and so you do not need anyone to teach you,1
4100,ACT,8,NRSV,now when simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money saying give me also this power so that anyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit,yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying when the messiah comes will he do more signs than this man has done,1
4101,ACT,8,NRSV,but peter said to him may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain gods gift with money you have no part or share in this for your heart is not right before god,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,1
4102,ACT,8,NRSV,repent therefore of this wickedness of yours and pray to the lord that if possible the intent of your heart may be forgiven you,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight,1
4103,ACT,8,NRSV,for i see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness,no i tell you but rather division from now on five in one household will be divided three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw,1
4104,ACT,8,NRSV,simon answered pray for me to the lord that nothing of what you have said may happen to me,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,1
4105,ACT,8,NRSV,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans,and as for the dead being raised have you not read in the book of moses in the story about the bush how god said to him i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,1
4106,ACT,8,NRSV,then an angel of the lord said to philip get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza,was it not all those who left egypt under the leadership of moses,1
4107,ACT,8,NRSV,this is a wilderness road so he got up and went,then jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe,1
4108,ACT,8,NRSV,now there was an ethiopian eunuch a court official of the candace queen of the ethiopians in charge of her entire treasury,so then friends we are children not of the slave but of the free woman,1
4109,ACT,8,NRSV,he had come to jerusalem to worship and was returning home seated in his chariot he was reading the prophet isaiah,so they seized him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,1
4110,ACT,8,NRSV,then the spirit said to philip go over to this chariot and join it,the men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one,1
4111,ACT,8,NRSV,so philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet isaiah,so they left him and went away,1
4112,ACT,8,NRSV,he asked do you understand what you are reading,i wrapped it up in a piece of cloth for i was afraid of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow,1
4113,ACT,8,NRSV,he replied how can i unless someone guides me,then simon peter who had a sword drew it struck the high priests slave and cut off his right ear,1
4114,ACT,8,NRSV,and he invited philip to get in and sit beside him,this became known throughout joppa and many believed in the lord,1
4115,ACT,8,NRSV,now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb silent before its shearer so he does not open his mouth,just as it was in the days of noah so too it will be in the days of the son of man,1
4116,ACT,8,NRSV,in his humiliation justice was denied him,why do you submit to regulations do not handle do not taste do not touch,1
4117,ACT,8,NRSV,for his life is taken away from the earth,and why do you worry about clothing,1
4118,ACT,8,NRSV,the eunuch asked philip about whom may i ask you does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else,very truly i tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice you will have pain but your pain will turn into joy,1
4119,ACT,8,NRSV,then philip began to speak and starting with this scripture he proclaimed to him the good news about jesus,meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted,1
4120,ACT,8,NRSV,as they were going along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said look here is water what is to prevent me from being baptized,after staying there for a considerable time paul said farewell to the believers and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila,1
4121,ACT,8,NRSV,he commanded the chariot to stop and both of them philip and the eunuch went down into the water and philip baptized him,who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service,1
4122,ACT,8,NRSV,when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord snatched philip away the eunuch saw him no more and went on his way rejoicing,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight,1
4123,ACT,8,NRSV,but philip found himself at azotus and as he was passing through the region he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to caesarea,i thank my god every time i remember you constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now,1
4124,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the lord went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at damascus so that if he found any who belonged to the way men or women he might bring them bound to jerusalem,nothing accursed will be found there any more,1
4125,ACT,9,NRSV,now as he was going along and approaching damascus suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,1
4126,ACT,9,NRSV,he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why do you persecute me,then two bandits were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left,1
4127,ACT,9,NRSV,he asked who are you lord,he called one of the slaves and asked what was going on,1
4128,ACT,9,NRSV,the reply came i am jesus whom you are persecuting,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest,1
4129,ACT,9,NRSV,but get up and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do,he disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them triumphing over them in it,1
4130,ACT,9,NRSV,the men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one,but peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them men of judea and all who live in jerusalem let this be known to you and listen to what i say,1
4131,ACT,9,NRSV,saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus,and they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not believe him,1
4132,ACT,9,NRSV,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank,and he answers from within do not bother me the door has already been locked and my children are with me in bed i cannot get up and give you anything,1
4133,ACT,9,NRSV,now there was a disciple in damascus named ananias,for this gospel i was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher and for this reason i suffer as i do,1
4134,ACT,9,NRSV,the lord said to him in a vision ananias,and when they could not bring him to jesus because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and after having dug through it they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay,1
4135,ACT,9,NRSV,he answered here i am lord,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus,1
4136,ACT,9,NRSV,the lord said to him get up and go to the street called straight and at the house of judas look for a man of tarsus named saul,as it is written for your sake we are being killed all day long we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered,1
4137,ACT,9,NRSV,at this moment he is praying and he has seen in a vision a man named ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight,it is before their own lord that they stand or fall,1
4138,ACT,9,NRSV,but ananias answered lord i have heard from many about this man how much evil he has done to your saints in jerusalem and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name,while he was speaking a pharisee invited him to dine with him so he went in and took his place at the table,1
4139,ACT,9,NRSV,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,then annas sent him bound to caiaphas the high priest,1
4140,ACT,9,NRSV,so ananias went and entered the house,do not move about from house to house,1
4141,ACT,9,NRSV,he laid his hands on saul and said brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on your way here has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the holy spirit,and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth,1
4142,ACT,9,NRSV,and immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and his sight was restored,therefore also the wisdom of god said i will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and persecute so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary,1
4143,ACT,9,NRSV,then he got up and was baptized and after taking some food he regained his strength,for i also am a man set under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it,1
4144,ACT,9,NRSV,for several days he was with the disciples in damascus and immediately he began to proclaim jesus in the synagogues saying he is the son of god,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days,1
4145,ACT,9,NRSV,all who heard him were amazed and said is not this the man who made havoc in jerusalem among those who invoked this name,paul visited him and cured him by praying and putting his hands on him,1
4146,ACT,9,NRSV,and has he not come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests,whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you eat what is set before you cure the sick who are there and say to them the kingdom of god has come near to you,1
4147,ACT,9,NRSV,saul became increasingly more powerful and confounded the jews who lived in damascus by proving that jesus was the messiah,let it be known to you then that this salvation of god has been sent to the gentiles they will listen,1
4148,ACT,9,NRSV,after some time had passed the jews plotted to kill him but their plot became known to saul,the second angel blew his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea,1
4149,ACT,9,NRSV,they were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall lowering him in a basket,if you have ordinary cases then do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church,1
4150,ACT,9,NRSV,when he had come to jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples and they were all afraid of him for they did not believe that he was a disciple,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb,1
4151,ACT,9,NRSV,but barnabas took him brought him to the apostles and described for them how on the road he had seen the lord who had spoken to him and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of jesus,it is the lord who judges me,1
4152,ACT,9,NRSV,so he went in and out among them in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord,after this happened the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured,1
4153,ACT,9,NRSV,he spoke and argued with the hellenists but they were attempting to kill him,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,1
4154,ACT,9,NRSV,when the believers learned of it they brought him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus,so pilate went out to them and said what accusation do you bring against this man,1
4155,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile the church throughout judea galilee and samaria had peace and was built up,when the river burst against it immediately it fell and great was the ruin of that house,1
4156,ACT,9,NRSV,living in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit it increased in numbers,but it is not so among you but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all,1
4157,ACT,9,NRSV,now as peter went here and there among all the believers he came down also to the saints living in lydda,when the disciples saw it they were amazed saying how did the fig tree wither at once,1
4158,ACT,9,NRSV,there he found a man named aeneas who had been bedridden for eight years for he was paralyzed,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery,1
4159,ACT,9,NRSV,peter said to him aeneas jesus christ heals you get up and make your bed and immediately he got up,and after getting into a boat he crossed the sea and came to his own town,1
4160,ACT,9,NRSV,and all the residents of lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord,he will come when he has the opportunity,1
4161,ACT,9,NRSV,now in joppa there was a disciple whose name was tabitha which in greek is dorcas,whatever house you enter first say peace to this house and if anyone is there who shares in peace your peace will rest on that person but if not it will return to you,1
4162,ACT,9,NRSV,she was devoted to good works and acts of charity,i can will what is right but i cannot do it,1
4163,ACT,9,NRSV,at that time she became ill and died,the tribune took him by the hand drew him aside privately and asked what is it that you have to report to me,1
4164,ACT,9,NRSV,when they had washed her they laid her in a room upstairs,such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the whole crowd stood on the beach,1
4165,ACT,9,NRSV,since lydda was near joppa the disciples who heard that peter was there sent two men to him with the request please come to us without delay,cut it down why should it be wasting the soil,1
4166,ACT,9,NRSV,so peter got up and went with them and when he arrived they took him to the room upstairs,many will come in my name and say i am he and they will lead many astray,1
4167,ACT,9,NRSV,all the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that dorcas had made while she was with them,indeed there have to be factions among you for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine,1
4168,ACT,9,NRSV,peter put all of them outside and then he knelt down and prayed,and god spoke in these terms that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years,1
4169,ACT,9,NRSV,he turned to the body and said tabitha get up,and this story is still told among the jews to this day,1
4170,ACT,9,NRSV,then she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up,in this way god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets that his messiah would suffer,1
4171,ACT,9,NRSV,he gave her his hand and helped her up,is it not the rich who oppress you,1
4172,ACT,9,NRSV,then calling the saints and widows he showed her to be alive,and he dismissed them from the tribunal,1
4173,ACT,9,NRSV,this became known throughout joppa and many believed in the lord,it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who brought you good news by the holy spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look therefore prepare your minds for action discipline yourselves set all your hope on the grace that jesus christ will bring you when he is revealed,1
4174,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile he stayed in joppa for some time with a certain simon a tanner,from then on pilate tried to release him but the jews cried out if you release this man you are no friend of the emperor,1
4175,ACT,10,NRSV,in caesarea there was a man named cornelius a centurion of the italian cohort as it was called,i was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth namely how you walk in the truth,1
4176,ACT,10,NRSV,he was a devout man who feared god with all his household he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to god,do your best to come to me soon for demas in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia titus to dalmatia,1
4177,ACT,10,NRSV,one afternoon at about three oclock he had a vision in which he clearly saw an angel of god coming in and saying to him cornelius,it is sown a physical body it is raised a spiritual body,1
4178,ACT,10,NRSV,he stared at him in terror and said what is it lord,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did,1
4179,ACT,10,NRSV,he answered your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before god,truly i tell you wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her,1
4180,ACT,10,NRSV,now send men to joppa for a certain simon who is called peter he is lodging with simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside,he first found his brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated anointed ,1
4181,ACT,10,NRSV,when the angel who spoke to him had left he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him and after telling them everything he sent them to joppa,then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done to you,1
4182,ACT,10,NRSV,about noon the next day as they were on their journey and approaching the city peter went up on the roof to pray,but i have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him,1
4183,ACT,10,NRSV,he became hungry and wanted something to eat and while it was being prepared he fell into a trance,and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent,1
4184,ACT,10,NRSV,he saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down being lowered to the ground by its four corners,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it,1
4185,ACT,10,NRSV,in it were all kinds of fourfooted creatures and reptiles and birds of the air,for the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith,1
4186,ACT,10,NRSV,then he heard a voice saying get up peter kill and eat,go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice,1
4187,ACT,10,NRSV,but peter said by no means lord for i have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean,then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and on my return i would have received what was my own with interest,1
4188,ACT,10,NRSV,the voice said to him again a second time what god has made clean you must not call profane,and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on matthias and he was added to the eleven apostles,1
4189,ACT,10,NRSV,this happened three times and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven,he said to him well done good slave because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing take charge of ten cities,1
4190,ACT,10,NRSV,now while peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen suddenly the men sent by cornelius appeared,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils,1
4191,ACT,10,NRSV,they were asking for simons house and were standing by the gate,peace be to the whole community and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ,1
4192,ACT,10,NRSV,they called out to ask whether simon who was called peter was staying there,at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,1
4193,ACT,10,NRSV,while peter was still thinking about the vision the spirit said to him look three men are searching for you,nevertheless you say since i was crafty i took you in by deceit,1
4194,ACT,10,NRSV,now get up go down and go with them without hesitation for i have sent them,if they say look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it,1
4195,ACT,10,NRSV,so peter went down to the men and said i am the one you are looking for what is the reason for your coming,once when jesus was praying alone with only the disciples near him he asked them who do the crowds say that i am,1
4196,ACT,10,NRSV,they answered cornelius a centurion an upright and godfearing man who is well spoken of by the whole jewish nation was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say,but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace,1
4197,ACT,10,NRSV,so peter invited them in and gave them lodging,did i commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted because i proclaimed gods good news to you free of charge,1
4198,ACT,10,NRSV,the next day he got up and went with them and some of the believers from joppa accompanied him,it hurts you to kick against the goads,1
4199,ACT,10,NRSV,the following day they came to caesarea,he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory,1
4200,ACT,10,NRSV,cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends,he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,1
4201,ACT,10,NRSV,on peters arrival cornelius met him and falling at his feet worshiped him,now simon peter was standing and warming himself,1
4202,ACT,10,NRSV,but peter made him get up saying stand up i am only a mortal,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,1
4203,ACT,10,NRSV,and as he talked with him he went in and found that many had assembled and he said to them you yourselves know that it is unlawful for a jew to associate with or to visit a gentile but god has shown me that i should not call anyone profane or unclean,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth,1
4204,ACT,10,NRSV,so when i was sent for i came without objection,if what you heard from the beginning abides in you then you will abide in the son and in the father,1
4205,ACT,10,NRSV,now may i ask why you sent for me,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,1
4206,ACT,10,NRSV,cornelius replied four days ago at this very hour at three oclock i was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me,after him judas the galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him he also perished and all who followed him were scattered,1
4207,ACT,10,NRSV,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god,then they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia,1
4208,ACT,10,NRSV,send therefore to joppa and ask for simon who is called peter he is staying in the home of simon a tanner by the sea,figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush,1
4209,ACT,10,NRSV,therefore i sent for you immediately and you have been kind enough to come,this was because he was telling the good news about jesus and the resurrection so they took him and brought him to the areopagus and asked him may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting,1
4210,ACT,10,NRSV,so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say,remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show every courtesy to everyone,1
4211,ACT,10,NRSV,then peter began to speak to them i truly understand that god shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human,1
4212,ACT,10,NRSV,you know the message he sent to the people of israel preaching peace by jesus christhe is lord of all,now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized he left judea and started back to galilee,1
4213,ACT,10,NRSV,that message spread throughout judea beginning in galilee after the baptism that john announced how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for god was with him,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret,1
4214,ACT,10,NRSV,we are witnesses to all that he did both in judea and in jerusalem,and to the angel of the church in pergamum write these are the words of him who has the sharp twoedged sword i know where you are living where satans throne is,1
4215,ACT,10,NRSV,they put him to death by hanging him on a tree but god raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear not to all the people but to us who were chosen by god as witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead,for the son of man is going as it has been determined but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this,1
4216,ACT,10,NRSV,he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by god as judge of the living and the dead,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think,1
4217,ACT,10,NRSV,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name,then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter,1
4218,ACT,10,NRSV,while peter was still speaking the holy spirit fell upon all who heard the word,when they had done this they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break,1
4219,ACT,10,NRSV,the circumcised believers who had come with peter were astounded that the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on the gentiles for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling god,for if someone comes and proclaims another jesus than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you submit to it readily enough,1
4220,ACT,10,NRSV,then peter said can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the holy spirit just as we have,blessed are those who have no reason to condemn themselves because of what they approve,1
4221,ACT,10,NRSV,so he ordered them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner,1
4222,ACT,10,NRSV,then they invited him to stay for several days,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith declared the gospel beforehand to abraham saying all the gentiles shall be blessed in you,1
4223,ACT,11,NRSV,now the apostles and the believers who were in judea heard that the gentiles had also accepted the word of god,then when i returned i could have collected it with interest,1
4224,ACT,11,NRSV,so when peter went up to jerusalem the circumcised believers criticized him saying why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them,in returni speak as to childrenopen wide your hearts also,1
4225,ACT,11,NRSV,then peter began to explain it to them step by step saying i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision,and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me,1
4226,ACT,11,NRSV,there was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven being lowered by its four corners and it came close to me,truly i tell you people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit can never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin for they had said he has an unclean spirit,1
4227,ACT,11,NRSV,as i looked at it closely i saw fourfooted animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air,after saying this he remained in galilee,1
4228,ACT,11,NRSV,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb,1
4229,ACT,11,NRSV,but i replied by no means lord for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth,he confessed and did not deny it but confessed i am not the messiah,1
4230,ACT,11,NRSV,but a second time the voice answered from heaven what god has made clean you must not call profane,will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,1
4231,ACT,11,NRSV,this happened three times then everything was pulled up again to heaven,and he said to him i will come and cure him,1
4232,ACT,11,NRSV,at that very moment three men sent to me from caesarea arrived at the house where we were,you have heard of the endurance of job and you have seen the purpose of the lord how the lord is compassionate and merciful,1
4233,ACT,11,NRSV,the spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us,and besides other things i am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches,1
4234,ACT,11,NRSV,these six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the mans house,for it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile,1
4235,ACT,11,NRSV,he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and bring simon who is called peter he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved,on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,1
4236,ACT,11,NRSV,and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband is the head of his wife and god is the head of christ,1
4237,ACT,11,NRSV,and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit,if there is anything further you want to know it must be settled in the regular assembly,1
4238,ACT,11,NRSV,if then god gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i could hinder god,jesus answered them go and tell john what you hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have good news brought to them,1
4239,ACT,11,NRSV,when they heard this they were silenced,for you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged,1
4240,ACT,11,NRSV,and they praised god saying then god has given even to the gentiles the repentance that leads to life,he came to us and took pauls belt bound his own feet and hands with it and said thus says the holy spirit this is the way the jews in jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles,1
4241,ACT,11,NRSV,now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over stephen traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch and they spoke the word to no one except jews,for he had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit then jesus asked him what is your name,1
4242,ACT,11,NRSV,but among them were some men of cyprus and cyrene who on coming to antioch spoke to the hellenists also proclaiming the lord jesus,i know what it is to have little and i know what it is to have plenty,1
4243,ACT,11,NRSV,the hand of the lord was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord,then they all shouted out together away with this fellow release barabbas for us this was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city and for murder pilate wanting to release jesus addressed them again but they kept shouting crucify crucify him a third time he said to them why what evil has he done,1
4244,ACT,11,NRSV,news of this came to the ears of the church in jerusalem and they sent barnabas to antioch,he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out,1
4245,ACT,11,NRSV,when he came and saw the grace of god he rejoiced and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the lord with steadfast devotion for he was a good man full of the holy spirit and of faith,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd,1
4246,ACT,11,NRSV,and a great many people were brought to the lord,then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising god with a loud voice,1
4247,ACT,11,NRSV,then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he had found him he brought him to antioch,but he said to them do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified,1
4248,ACT,11,NRSV,so it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people and it was in antioch that the disciples were first called christians,but if you had known what this means i desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless,1
4249,ACT,11,NRSV,at that time prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch,now while jesus was at bethany in the house of simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table,1
4250,ACT,11,NRSV,one of them named agabus stood up and predicted by the spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world and this took place during the reign of claudius,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,1
4251,ACT,11,NRSV,the disciples determined that according to their ability each would send relief to the believers living in judea this they did sending it to the elders by barnabas and saul,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained,1
4252,ACT,12,NRSV,about that time king herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church,so the chief priests planned to put lazarus to death as well since it was on account of him that many of the jews were deserting and were believing in jesus,1
4253,ACT,12,NRSV,he had james the brother of john killed with the sword,but it is god who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts as a first installment,1
4254,ACT,12,NRSV,after he saw that it pleased the jews he proceeded to arrest peter also,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the advocate will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you,1
4255,ACT,12,NRSV,this was during the festival of unleavened bread when he had seized him he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him intending to bring him out to the people after the passover,he came from the jewish town of arimathea and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god,1
4256,ACT,12,NRSV,while peter was kept in prison the church prayed fervently to god for him,of this mans posterity god has brought to israel a savior jesus as he promised before his coming john had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel,1
4257,ACT,12,NRSV,the very night before herod was going to bring him out peter bound with two chains was sleeping between two soldiers while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison,if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person,1
4258,ACT,12,NRSV,suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,1
4259,ACT,12,NRSV,he tapped peter on the side and woke him saying get up quickly,again he began to teach beside the sea,1
4260,ACT,12,NRSV,and the chains fell off his wrists,the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we will not find him,1
4261,ACT,12,NRSV,the angel said to him fasten your belt and put on your sandals,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews,1
4262,ACT,12,NRSV,then he said to him wrap your cloak around you and follow me,i baptize you with water for repentance but one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to carry his sandals,1
4263,ACT,12,NRSV,peter went out and followed him he did not realize that what was happening with the angels help was real he thought he was seeing a vision,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear,1
4264,ACT,12,NRSV,after they had passed the first and the second guard they came before the iron gate leading into the city,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends,1
4265,ACT,12,NRSV,it opened for them of its own accord and they went outside and walked along a lane when suddenly the angel left him,when they heard it they praised god,1
4266,ACT,12,NRSV,then peter came to himself and said now i am sure that the lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of herod and from all that the jewish people were expecting,keep your conscience clear so that when you are maligned those who abuse you for your good conduct in christ may be put to shame,1
4267,ACT,12,NRSV,as soon as he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john whose other name was mark where many had gathered and were praying,your eye is the lamp of your body,1
4268,ACT,12,NRSV,when he knocked at the outer gate a maid named rhoda came to answer,then he said to me it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end,1
4269,ACT,12,NRSV,on recognizing peters voice she was so overjoyed that instead of opening the gate she ran in and announced that peter was standing at the gate,for all of them had married her,1
4270,ACT,12,NRSV,they said to her you are out of your mind but she insisted that it was so,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven,1
4271,ACT,12,NRSV,they said it is his angel,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand,1
4272,ACT,12,NRSV,meanwhile peter continued knocking and when they opened the gate they saw him and were amazed,when they got into the boat the wind ceased,1
4273,ACT,12,NRSV,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison,they came to the other side of the sea to the country of the gerasenes,1
4274,ACT,12,NRSV,and he added tell this to james and to the believers,after they have flogged him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again,1
4275,ACT,12,NRSV,then he left and went to another place,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask,1
4276,ACT,12,NRSV,when morning came there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of peter,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives,1
4277,ACT,12,NRSV,when herod had searched for him and could not find him he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death,one night the lord said to paul in a vision do not be afraid but speak and do not be silent for i am with you and no one will lay a hand on you to harm you for there are many in this city who are my people,1
4278,ACT,12,NRSV,then he went down from judea to caesarea and stayed there,when jesus had received the wine he said it is finished,1
4279,ACT,12,NRSV,now herod was angry with the people of tyre and sidon,after he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years,1
4280,ACT,12,NRSV,so they came to him in a body and after winning over blastus the kings chamberlain they asked for a reconciliation because their country depended on the kings country for food,and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent,1
4281,ACT,12,NRSV,on an appointed day herod put on his royal robes took his seat on the platform and delivered a public address to them,we have heard it ourselves from his own lips,1
4282,ACT,12,NRSV,the people kept shouting the voice of a god and not of a mortal and immediately because he had not given the glory to god an angel of the lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died,the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem,1
4283,ACT,12,NRSV,but the word of god continued to advance and gain adherents,do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have come not to abolish but to fulfill,1
4284,ACT,12,NRSV,then after completing their mission barnabas and saul returned to jerusalem and brought with them john whose other name was mark,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name,1
4285,ACT,13,NRSV,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler and saul,and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,1
4286,ACT,13,NRSV,while they were worshiping the lord and fasting the holy spirit said set apart for me barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them,zechariah said to the angel how will i know that this is so,1
4287,ACT,13,NRSV,then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off,how can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is god,1
4288,ACT,13,NRSV,so being sent out by the holy spirit they went down to seleucia and from there they sailed to cyprus,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing,1
4289,ACT,13,NRSV,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews,but god has so arranged the body giving the greater honor to the inferior member that there may be no dissension within the body but the members may have the same care for one another,1
4290,ACT,13,NRSV,and they had john also to assist them,thomas answered him my lord and my god jesus said to him have you believed because you have seen me,1
4291,ACT,13,NRSV,when they had gone through the whole island as far as paphos they met a certain magician a jewish false prophet named barjesus,then he sent them to bethlehem saying go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word so that i may also go and pay him homage,1
4292,ACT,13,NRSV,he was with the proconsul sergius paulus an intelligent man who summoned barnabas and saul and wanted to hear the word of god,remind them of this and warn them before god that they are to avoid wrangling over words which does no good but only ruins those who are listening,1
4293,ACT,13,NRSV,but the magician elymas for that is the translation of his name opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish,1
4294,ACT,13,NRSV,but saul also known as paul filled with the holy spirit looked intently at him and said you son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness full of all deceit and villainy will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the lord,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up,1
4295,ACT,13,NRSV,and now listenthe hand of the lord is against you and you will be blind for a while unable to see the sun,now then you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case,1
4296,ACT,13,NRSV,immediately mist and darkness came over him and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand,there were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting,1
4297,ACT,13,NRSV,when the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was astonished at the teaching about the lord,jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband,1
4298,ACT,13,NRSV,then paul and his companions set sail from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia,whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me,1
4299,ACT,13,NRSV,john however left them and returned to jerusalem but they went on from perga and came to antioch in pisidia,it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade,1
4300,ACT,13,NRSV,and on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone,1
4301,ACT,13,NRSV,after the reading of the law and the prophets the officials of the synagogue sent them a message saying brothers if you have any word of exhortation for the people give it,paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand,1
4302,ACT,13,NRSV,so paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak you israelites and others who fear god listen,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me,1
4303,ACT,13,NRSV,the god of this people israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of egypt and with uplifted arm he led them out of it,for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him but he was killed and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared,1
4304,ACT,13,NRSV,for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery,1
4305,ACT,13,NRSV,after he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ,1
4306,ACT,13,NRSV,after that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet samuel,at that moment she came and began to praise god and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of jerusalem,1
4307,ACT,13,NRSV,then they asked for a king and god gave them saul son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin who reigned for forty years,every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit,1
4308,ACT,13,NRSV,when he had removed him he made david their king,and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on matthias and he was added to the eleven apostles,1
4309,ACT,13,NRSV,in his testimony about him he said i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who will carry out all my wishes,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father or who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him,1
4310,ACT,13,NRSV,of this mans posterity god has brought to israel a savior jesus as he promised before his coming john had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel,therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals new moons or sabbaths,1
4311,ACT,13,NRSV,and as john was finishing his work he said what do you suppose that i am,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name,1
4312,ACT,13,NRSV,no but one is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each,1
4313,ACT,13,NRSV,my brothers you descendants of abrahams family and others who fear god to us the message of this salvation has been sent,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,1
4314,ACT,13,NRSV,because the residents of jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath they fulfilled those words by condemning him,in any case it was kind of you to share my distress,1
4315,ACT,13,NRSV,even though they found no cause for a sentence of death they asked pilate to have him killed,a reed shaken by the wind,1
4316,ACT,13,NRSV,when they had carried out everything that was written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb,or what fellowship is there between light and darkness,1
4317,ACT,13,NRSV,but god raised him from the dead and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from galilee to jerusalem and they are now his witnesses to the people,why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me,1
4318,ACT,13,NRSV,and we bring you the good news that what god promised to our ancestors he has fulfilled for us their children by raising jesus as also it is written in the second psalm you are my son today i have begotten you,and he said young man i say to you rise the dead man sat up and began to speak and jesus gave him to his mother,1
4319,ACT,13,NRSV,as to his raising him from the dead no more to return to corruption he has spoken in this way i will give you the holy promises made to david,to another he said follow me,1
4320,ACT,13,NRSV,therefore he has also said in another psalm you will not let your holy one experience corruption,when it comes it finds it empty swept and put in order,1
4321,ACT,13,NRSV,for david after he had served the purpose of god in his own generation died was laid beside his ancestors and experienced corruption but he whom god raised up experienced no corruption,every sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and would try to convince jews and greeks,1
4322,ACT,13,NRSV,let it be known to you therefore my brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you by this jesus everyone who believes is set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the law of moses,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,1
4323,ACT,13,NRSV,beware therefore that what the prophets said does not happen to you look you scoffers be amazed and perish for in your days i am doing a work a work that you will never believe even if someone tells you,then many will fall away and they will betray one another and hate one another,1
4324,ACT,13,NRSV,as paul and barnabas were going out the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath,i will make those of the synagogue of satan who say that they are jews and are not but are lyingi will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that i have loved you,1
4325,ACT,13,NRSV,when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god,but after the three and a half days the breath of life from god entered them and they stood on their feet and those who saw them were terrified,1
4326,ACT,13,NRSV,the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord,but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie and just as it has taught you abide in him,1
4327,ACT,13,NRSV,but when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy and blaspheming they contradicted what was spoken by paul,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb,1
4328,ACT,13,NRSV,then both paul and barnabas spoke out boldly saying it was necessary that the word of god should be spoken first to you,i write to you young people because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the evil one,1
4329,ACT,13,NRSV,since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life we are now turning to the gentiles,from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain,1
4330,ACT,13,NRSV,for so the lord has commanded us saying i have set you to be a light for the gentiles so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1
4331,ACT,13,NRSV,when the gentiles heard this they were glad and praised the word of the lord and as many as had been destined for eternal life became believers,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you,1
4332,ACT,13,NRSV,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region,jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them can they,1
4333,ACT,13,NRSV,but the jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city and stirred up persecution against paul and barnabas and drove them out of their region,send therefore to joppa and ask for simon who is called peter he is staying in the home of simon a tanner by the sea,1
4334,ACT,13,NRSV,so they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to iconium,now they know that everything you have given me is from you for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me,1
4335,ACT,13,NRSV,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit,i was dead and see i am alive forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of hades,1
4336,ACT,14,NRSV,the same thing occurred in iconium where paul and barnabas went into the jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both jews and greeks became believers,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel,1
4337,ACT,14,NRSV,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers,indeed all who want to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted,1
4338,ACT,14,NRSV,so they remained for a long time speaking boldly for the lord who testified to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through them,now that day was a sabbath,1
4339,ACT,14,NRSV,but the residents of the city were divided some sided with the jews and some with the apostles,but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come,1
4340,ACT,14,NRSV,and when an attempt was made by both gentiles and jews with their rulers to mistreat them and to stone them the apostles learned of it and fled to lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and to the surrounding country and there they continued proclaiming the good news,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you,1
4341,ACT,14,NRSV,in lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet and had never walked for he had been crippled from birth,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven,1
4342,ACT,14,NRSV,he listened to paul as he was speaking,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness,1
4343,ACT,14,NRSV,and paul looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed said in a loud voice stand upright on your feet,when the crowds saw it they were filled with awe and they glorified god who had given such authority to human beings,1
4344,ACT,14,NRSV,and the man sprang up and began to walk,this is my defense to those who would examine me,1
4345,ACT,14,NRSV,when the crowds saw what paul had done they shouted in the lycaonian language the gods have come down to us in human form barnabas they called zeus and paul they called hermes because he was the chief speaker,when they could not pay he canceled the debts for both of them,1
4346,ACT,14,NRSV,the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice,now those who were scattered went from place to place proclaiming the word,1
4347,ACT,14,NRSV,when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of it they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd shouting friends why are you doing this,a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was already being swamped,1
4348,ACT,14,NRSV,we are mortals just like you and we bring you good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them,suddenly one of those with jesus put his hand on his sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear,1
4349,ACT,14,NRSV,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy,for it is as if a man going on a journey summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them to one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his ability,1
4350,ACT,14,NRSV,even with these words they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them,let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured,1
4351,ACT,14,NRSV,but jews came there from antioch and iconium and won over the crowds,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory,1
4352,ACT,14,NRSV,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me,1
4353,ACT,14,NRSV,but when the disciples surrounded him he got up and went into the city,then they said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings,1
4354,ACT,14,NRSV,the next day he went on with barnabas to derbe,then he said to me these are they who have come out of the great ordeal they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb,1
4355,ACT,14,NRSV,after they had proclaimed the good news to that city and had made many disciples they returned to lystra then on to iconium and antioch,when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure when slandered we speak kindly,1
4356,ACT,14,NRSV,there they strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith saying it is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of god,there was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven being lowered by its four corners and it came close to me,1
4357,ACT,14,NRSV,and after they had appointed elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had come to believe,in the same way my friends you have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god,1
4358,ACT,14,NRSV,then they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia,he left them went out of the city to bethany and spent the night there,1
4359,ACT,14,NRSV,when they had spoken the word in perga they went down to attalia,did not moses give you the law,1
4360,ACT,14,NRSV,from there they sailed back to antioch where they had been commended to the grace of god for the work that they had completed,for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp,1
4361,ACT,14,NRSV,when they arrived they called the church together and related all that god had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles,then peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijah,1
4362,ACT,14,NRSV,and they stayed there with the disciples for some time,in the morning while it was still very dark he got up and went out to a deserted place and there he prayed,1
4363,ACT,15,NRSV,then certain individuals came down from judea and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god to the saints who are in ephesus and are faithful in christ jesus grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1
4364,ACT,15,NRSV,and after paul and barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them paul and barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders,for if you love those who love you what reward do you have,1
4365,ACT,15,NRSV,so they were sent on their way by the church and as they passed through both phoenicia and samaria they reported the conversion of the gentiles and brought great joy to all the believers,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints,1
4366,ACT,15,NRSV,when they came to jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they reported all that god had done with them,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in various places there will be famines,1
4367,ACT,15,NRSV,but some believers who belonged to the sect of the pharisees stood up and said it is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of moses,in his testimony about him he said i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who will carry out all my wishes,1
4368,ACT,15,NRSV,the apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter,for i have come to call not the righteous but sinners,1
4369,ACT,15,NRSV,after there had been much debate peter stood up and said to them my brothers you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that i should be the one through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers,now when forty years had passed an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in the flame of a burning bush,1
4370,ACT,15,NRSV,and god who knows the human heart testified to them by giving them the holy spirit just as he did to us and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us,this is the reason that i have so often been hindered from coming to you,1
4371,ACT,15,NRSV,now therefore why are you putting god to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart,1
4372,ACT,15,NRSV,on the contrary we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the lord jesus just as they will,do not presume to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,1
4373,ACT,15,NRSV,the whole assembly kept silence and listened to barnabas and paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that god had done through them among the gentiles,for the seven had married her,1
4374,ACT,15,NRSV,after they finished speaking james replied my brothers listen to me,she was devoted to good works and acts of charity,1
4375,ACT,15,NRSV,simeon has related how god first looked favorably on the gentiles to take from among them a people for his name,but he answered them you give them something to eat,1
4376,ACT,15,NRSV,this agrees with the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and i will rebuild the dwelling of david which has fallen from its ruins i will rebuild it and i will set it up so that all other peoples may seek the lord even all the gentiles over whom my name has been called,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones,1
4377,ACT,15,NRSV,thus says the lord who has been making these things known from long ago,it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification,1
4378,ACT,15,NRSV,therefore i have reached the decision that we should not trouble those gentiles who are turning to god but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me,1
4379,ACT,15,NRSV,for in every city for generations past moses has had those who proclaim him for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise none of the seven left children,1
4380,ACT,15,NRSV,then the apostles and the elders with the consent of the whole church decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to antioch with paul and barnabas,or what does a believer share with an unbeliever,1
4381,ACT,15,NRSV,they sent judas called barsabbas and silas leaders among the brothers with the following letter the brothers both the apostles and the elders to the believers of gentile origin in antioch and syria and cilicia greetings,and all the prophets as many as have spoken from samuel and those after him also predicted these days,1
4382,ACT,15,NRSV,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,when he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor he told them a parable,1
4383,ACT,15,NRSV,we have therefore sent judas and silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace,1
4384,ACT,15,NRSV,for it has seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy,1
4385,ACT,15,NRSV,if you keep yourselves from these you will do well,but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb taking the spices that they had prepared,1
4386,ACT,15,NRSV,so they were sent off and went down to antioch,pilate asked him again have you no answer,1
4387,ACT,15,NRSV,when they gathered the congregation together they delivered the letter,but i received mercy because i had acted ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in christ jesus,1
4388,ACT,15,NRSV,when its members read it they rejoiced at the exhortation,jumping up he stood and began to walk and he entered the temple with them walking and leaping and praising god,1
4389,ACT,15,NRSV,judas and silas who were themselves prophets said much to encourage and strengthen the believers,truly i tell you they have received their reward,1
4390,ACT,15,NRSV,after they had been there for some time they were sent off in peace by the believers to those who had sent them,he replied a hundred containers of wheat,1
4391,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,rather a person is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heartit is spiritual and not literal,1
4392,ACT,15,NRSV,after some days paul said to barnabas come let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the lord and see how they are doing,if i were still pleasing people i would not be a servant of christ,1
4393,ACT,15,NRSV,barnabas wanted to take with them john called mark,indeed all who want to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted,1
4394,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work,therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all,1
4395,ACT,15,NRSV,the disagreement became so sharp that they parted company barnabas took mark with him and sailed away to cyprus,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons,1
4396,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul chose silas and set out the believers commending him to the grace of the lord,the lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom,1
4397,ACT,15,NRSV,he went through syria and cilicia strengthening the churches,when he had finished speaking he knelt down with them all and prayed,1
4398,ACT,16,NRSV,paul went on also to derbe and to lystra where there was a disciple named timothy the son of a jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a greek,large crowds followed him and he cured them there,1
4399,ACT,16,NRSV,he was well spoken of by the believers in lystra and iconium,and they filled them up to the brim,1
4400,ACT,16,NRSV,paul wanted timothy to accompany him and he took him and had him circumcised because of the jews who were in those places for they all knew that his father was a greek,peter said to him aeneas jesus christ heals you get up and make your bed and immediately he got up,1
4401,ACT,16,NRSV,as they went from town to town they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem,for the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does,1
4402,ACT,16,NRSV,so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily,since therefore christ suffered in the flesh arm yourselves also with the same intention for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of god,1
4403,ACT,16,NRSV,they went through the region of phrygia and galatia having been forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in asia,follow me so the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die,1
4404,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had come opposite mysia they attempted to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus did not allow them so passing by mysia they went down to troas,the tribune answered it cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship,1
4405,ACT,16,NRSV,during the night paul had a vision there stood a man of macedonia pleading with him and saying come over to macedonia and help us,and the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets for god is a god not of disorder but of peace,1
4406,ACT,16,NRSV,when he had seen the vision we immediately tried to cross over to macedonia being convinced that god had called us to proclaim the good news to them,or did the word of god originate with you,1
4407,ACT,16,NRSV,we set sail from troas and took a straight course to samothrace the following day to neapolis and from there to philippi which is a leading city of the district of macedonia and a roman colony,and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you forever,1
4408,ACT,16,NRSV,we remained in this city for some days,after saying this he remained in galilee,1
4409,ACT,16,NRSV,on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river where we supposed there was a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there,now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out,1
4410,ACT,16,NRSV,a certain woman named lydia a worshiper of god was listening to us she was from the city of thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth,and no wonder even satan disguises himself as an angel of light,1
4411,ACT,16,NRSV,the lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by paul,he will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself,1
4412,ACT,16,NRSV,when she and her household were baptized she urged us saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come and stay at my home,my point is this heirs as long as they are minors are no better than slaves though they are the owners of all the property but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father,1
4413,ACT,16,NRSV,one day as we were going to the place of prayer we met a slavegirl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortunetelling,now such persons we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living,1
4414,ACT,16,NRSV,while she followed paul and us she would cry out these men are slaves of the most high god who proclaim to you a way of salvation,then jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last,1
4415,ACT,16,NRSV,she kept doing this for many days,see i am coming like a thief blessed is the one who stays awake and is clothed not going about naked and exposed to shame and they assembled them at the place that in hebrew is called harmagedon,1
4416,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her,but you say that if anyone tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is corban that is an offering to god then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother thus making void the word of god through your tradition that you have handed on,1
4417,ACT,16,NRSV,and it came out that very hour,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body,1
4418,ACT,16,NRSV,but when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect,1
4419,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had brought them before the magistrates they said these men are disturbing our city they are jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as romans to adopt or observe,then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land,1
4420,ACT,16,NRSV,the crowd joined in attacking them and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law,1
4421,ACT,16,NRSV,after they had given them a severe flogging they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely,then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him,1
4422,ACT,16,NRSV,following these instructions he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks,so when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place as was spoken of by the prophet daniel let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat,1
4423,ACT,16,NRSV,about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,1
4424,ACT,16,NRSV,suddenly there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyones chains were unfastened,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment,1
4425,ACT,16,NRSV,when the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped,and all of them said the same,1
4426,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul shouted in a loud voice do not harm yourself for we are all here,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation,1
4427,ACT,16,NRSV,the jailer called for lights and rushing in he fell down trembling before paul and silas,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast on that day,1
4428,ACT,16,NRSV,then he brought them outside and said sirs what must i do to be saved,paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1
4429,ACT,16,NRSV,they answered believe on the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household,and fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord,1
4430,ACT,16,NRSV,they spoke the word of the lord to him and to all who were in his house,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy,1
4431,ACT,16,NRSV,at the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds then he and his entire family were baptized without delay,it was also about these that enoch in the seventh generation from adam prophesied saying see the lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him,1
4432,ACT,16,NRSV,he brought them up into the house and set food before them and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in god,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight,1
4433,ACT,16,NRSV,when morning came the magistrates sent the police saying let those men go,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear,1
4434,ACT,16,NRSV,and the jailer reported the message to paul saying the magistrates sent word to let you go therefore come out now and go in peace,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,1
4435,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul replied they have beaten us in public uncondemned men who are roman citizens and have thrown us into prison and now are they going to discharge us in secret,so he took him brought him to the tribune and said the prisoner paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you he has something to tell you,1
4436,ACT,16,NRSV,certainly not let them come and take us out themselves,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you,1
4437,ACT,16,NRSV,the police reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were roman citizens so they came and apologized to them,and so we came to rome,1
4438,ACT,16,NRSV,and they took them out and asked them to leave the city,even so many will follow their licentious ways and because of these teachers the way of truth will be maligned,1
4439,ACT,16,NRSV,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there they departed,what is this wisdom that has been given to him,1
4440,ACT,17,NRSV,after paul and silas had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title,1
4441,ACT,17,NRSV,and paul went in as was his custom and on three sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures explaining and proving that it was necessary for the messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying this is the messiah jesus whom i am proclaiming to you,he asked them what are you arguing about with them,1
4442,ACT,17,NRSV,some of them were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a great many of the devout greeks and not a few of the leading women,then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying with such violence babylon the great city will be thrown down and will be found no more and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters will be heard in you no more and an artisan of any trade will be found in you no more and the sound of the millstone will be heard in you no more and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more for your merchants were the magnates of the earth and all nations were deceived by your sorcery,1
4443,ACT,17,NRSV,but the jews became jealous and with the help of some ruffians in the marketplaces they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar,look there is the place they laid him,1
4444,ACT,17,NRSV,while they were searching for paul and silas to bring them out to the assembly they attacked jasons house,not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us our competence is from god who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not of letter but of spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life,1
4445,ACT,17,NRSV,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also and jason has entertained them as guests,but jesus said to him do not stop him for whoever is not against you is for you,1
4446,ACT,17,NRSV,they are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor saying that there is another king named jesus,he answered to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given,1
4447,ACT,17,NRSV,the people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this and after they had taken bail from jason and the others they let them go,take care that you yourselves are not tempted,1
4448,ACT,17,NRSV,that very night the believers sent paul and silas off to beroea and when they arrived they went to the jewish synagogue,after this i heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and power to our god for his judgments are true and just he has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her fornication and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants,1
4449,ACT,17,NRSV,these jews were more receptive than those in thessalonica for they welcomed the message very eagerly and examined the scriptures every day to see whether these things were so,as it is there are many members yet one body,1
4450,ACT,17,NRSV,many of them therefore believed including not a few greek women and men of high standing,for in this city in fact both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the peoples of israel gathered together against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place,1
4451,ACT,17,NRSV,but when the jews of thessalonica learned that the word of god had been proclaimed by paul in beroea as well they came there too to stir up and incite the crowds,when he had left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about the parable,1
4452,ACT,17,NRSV,then the believers immediately sent paul away to the coast but silas and timothy remained behind,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse,1
4453,ACT,17,NRSV,those who conducted paul brought him as far as athens and after receiving instructions to have silas and timothy join him as soon as possible they left him,he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will stand,1
4454,ACT,17,NRSV,while paul was waiting for them in athens he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god,1
4455,ACT,17,NRSV,so he argued in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there,and we are ready to do away with him before he arrives,1
4456,ACT,17,NRSV,also some epicurean and stoic philosophers debated with him,rid yourselves therefore of all malice and all guile insincerity envy and all slander,1
4457,ACT,17,NRSV,some said what does this babbler want to say,the woman answered him i have no husband,1
4458,ACT,17,NRSV,others said he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities,as the father has sent me so i send you,1
4459,ACT,17,NRSV,this was because he was telling the good news about jesus and the resurrection so they took him and brought him to the areopagus and asked him may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting,five days later the high priest ananias came down with some elders and an attorney a certain tertullus and they reported their case against paul to the governor,1
4460,ACT,17,NRSV,it sounds rather strange to us so we would like to know what it means,then the scribe said to him you are right teacher you have truly said that he is one and besides him there is no other and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneselfthis is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,1
4461,ACT,17,NRSV,now all the athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new,when he saw that they were straining at the oars against an adverse wind he came towards them early in the morning walking on the sea,1
4462,ACT,17,NRSV,then paul stood in front of the areopagus and said athenians i see how extremely religious you are in every way,then he came forward and touched the bier and the bearers stood still,1
4463,ACT,17,NRSV,for as i went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship i found among them an altar with the inscription to an unknown god,and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it,1
4464,ACT,17,NRSV,what therefore you worship as unknown this i proclaim to you,do not fear what they fear and do not be intimidated but in your hearts sanctify christ as lord,1
4465,ACT,17,NRSV,the god who made the world and everything in it he who is lord of heaven and earth does not live in shrines made by human hands nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1
4466,ACT,17,NRSV,from one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live so that they would search for god and perhaps grope for him and find himthough indeed he is not far from each one of us,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him,1
4467,ACT,17,NRSV,for in him we live and move and have our being as even some of your own poets have said for we too are his offspring,i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now,1
4468,ACT,17,NRSV,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals,then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly my little daughter is at the point of death,1
4469,ACT,17,NRSV,while god has overlooked the times of human ignorance now he commands all people everywhere to repent because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead,if you do not have that discipline in which all children share then you are illegitimate and not his children,1
4470,ACT,17,NRSV,when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some scoffed but others said we will hear you again about this,when they reached capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to peter and said does your teacher not pay the temple tax,1
4471,ACT,17,NRSV,at that point paul left them,and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,1
4472,ACT,17,NRSV,but some of them joined him and became believers including dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food,1
4473,ACT,18,NRSV,after this paul left athens and went to corinth,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters,1
4474,ACT,18,NRSV,there he found a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had ordered all jews to leave rome,and i heard a loud voice from the throne saying see the home of god is among mortals,1
4475,ACT,18,NRSV,paul went to see them and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and they worked togetherby trade they were tentmakers,no you took along the tent of moloch and the star of your god rephan the images that you made to worship so i will remove you beyond babylon,1
4476,ACT,18,NRSV,every sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and would try to convince jews and greeks,yet not one of them is forgotten in gods sight,1
4477,ACT,18,NRSV,when silas and timothy arrived from macedonia paul was occupied with proclaiming the word testifying to the jews that the messiah was jesus,and they filled them up to the brim,1
4478,ACT,18,NRSV,when they opposed and reviled him in protest he shook the dust from his clothes and said to them your blood be on your own heads i am innocent,just this that christ is proclaimed in every way whether out of false motives or true and in that i rejoice,1
4479,ACT,18,NRSV,from now on i will go to the gentiles,whoever has seen me has seen the father,1
4480,ACT,18,NRSV,then he left the synagogue and went to the house of a man named titius justus a worshiper of god his house was next door to the synagogue,but the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not far from the land only about a hundred yards off,1
4481,ACT,18,NRSV,crispus the official of the synagogue became a believer in the lord together with all his household and many of the corinthians who heard paul became believers and were baptized,if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food and one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and eat your fill and yet you do not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that,1
4482,ACT,18,NRSV,one night the lord said to paul in a vision do not be afraid but speak and do not be silent for i am with you and no one will lay a hand on you to harm you for there are many in this city who are my people,and day by day the lord added to their number those who were being saved,1
4483,ACT,18,NRSV,he stayed there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them,as the father has loved me so i have loved you abide in my love,1
4484,ACT,18,NRSV,but when gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews made a united attack on paul and brought him before the tribunal,mary has chosen the better part which will not be taken away from her,1
4485,ACT,18,NRSV,they said this man is persuading people to worship god in ways that are contrary to the law,women likewise must be serious not slanderers but temperate faithful in all things,1
4486,ACT,18,NRSV,just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if it were a matter of crime or serious villainy i would be justified in accepting the complaint of you jews but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters,very truly i tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain but if it dies it bears much fruit,1
4487,ACT,18,NRSV,and he dismissed them from the tribunal,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber,1
4488,ACT,18,NRSV,then all of them seized sosthenes the official of the synagogue and beat him in front of the tribunal,it is to peace that god has called you,1
4489,ACT,18,NRSV,but gallio paid no attention to any of these things,for all who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted,1
4490,ACT,18,NRSV,after staying there for a considerable time paul said farewell to the believers and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he,1
4491,ACT,18,NRSV,at cenchreae he had his hair cut for he was under a vow,in it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold in which there were a golden urn holding the manna and aarons rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat,1
4492,ACT,18,NRSV,when they reached ephesus he left them there but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews,then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass,1
4493,ACT,18,NRSV,when they asked him to stay longer he declined but on taking leave of them he said i will return to you if god wills,these are grumblers and malcontents they indulge their own lusts they are bombastic in speech flattering people to their own advantage,1
4494,ACT,18,NRSV,then he set sail from ephesus,therefore openly before the churches show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you,1
4495,ACT,18,NRSV,when he had landed at caesarea he went up to jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to antioch,the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience signs and wonders and mighty works,1
4496,ACT,18,NRSV,after spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of galatia and phrygia strengthening all the disciples,whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life,1
4497,ACT,18,NRSV,now there came to ephesus a jew named apollos a native of alexandria,if this comes to the governors ears we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble,1
4498,ACT,18,NRSV,he was an eloquent man wellversed in the scriptures,if you then will worship me it will all be yours,1
4499,ACT,18,NRSV,he had been instructed in the way of the lord and he spoke with burning enthusiasm and taught accurately the things concerning jesus though he knew only the baptism of john,then they said to him where is your father,1
4500,ACT,18,NRSV,he began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained the way of god to him more accurately,he lived among the tombs and no one could restrain him any more even with a chain for he had often been restrained with shackles and chains but the chains he wrenched apart and the shackles he broke in pieces and no one had the strength to subdue him,1
4501,ACT,18,NRSV,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him,about noon the next day as they were on their journey and approaching the city peter went up on the roof to pray,1
4502,ACT,18,NRSV,on his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had become believers for he powerfully refuted the jews in public showing by the scriptures that the messiah is jesus,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,1
4503,ACT,19,NRSV,while apollos was in corinth paul passed through the interior regions and came to ephesus where he found some disciples,he also measured its wall one hundred fortyfour cubits by human measurement which the angel was using,1
4504,ACT,19,NRSV,he said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you became believers,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross,1
4505,ACT,19,NRSV,they replied no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit,this will be a sign for you you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger,1
4506,ACT,19,NRSV,then he said into what then were you baptized,on reading the letter he asked what province he belonged to and when he learned that he was from cilicia he said i will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive,1
4507,ACT,19,NRSV,paul said john baptized with the baptism of repentance telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is in jesus,they came to jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind the very man who had had the legion and they were afraid,1
4508,ACT,19,NRSV,on hearing this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus,when they had rowed about three or four miles they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were terrified,1
4509,ACT,19,NRSV,when paul had laid his hands on them the holy spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied altogether there were about twelve of them,day by day as they spent much time together in the temple they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts praising god and having the goodwill of all the people,1
4510,ACT,19,NRSV,he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly and argued persuasively about the kingdom of god,avoid profane chatter for it will lead people into more and more impiety and their talk will spread like gangrene,1
4511,ACT,19,NRSV,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus,as for you the anointing that you received from him abides in you and so you do not need anyone to teach you,1
4512,ACT,19,NRSV,this continued for two years so that all the residents of asia both jews and greeks heard the word of the lord,for i testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in laodicea and in hierapolis,1
4513,ACT,19,NRSV,god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them,although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered and having been made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him having been designated by god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek,1
4514,ACT,19,NRSV,then some itinerant jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the lord jesus over those who had evil spirits saying i adjure you by the jesus whom paul proclaims,when they had gone through the whole island as far as paphos they met a certain magician a jewish false prophet named barjesus,1
4515,ACT,19,NRSV,seven sons of a jewish high priest named sceva were doing this,the hand of the lord was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord,1
4516,ACT,19,NRSV,but the evil spirit said to them in reply jesus i know and paul i know but who are you,he said to him and you rule over five cities,1
4517,ACT,19,NRSV,then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them mastered them all and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded,when he came to galilee the galileans welcomed him since they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival,1
4518,ACT,19,NRSV,when this became known to all residents of ephesus both jews and greeks everyone was awestruck and the name of the lord jesus was praised,the pharisee was amazed to see that he did not first wash before dinner,1
4519,ACT,19,NRSV,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices,do not fear what they fear and do not be intimidated but in your hearts sanctify christ as lord,1
4520,ACT,19,NRSV,a number of those who practiced magic collected their books and burned them publicly when the value of these books was calculated it was found to come to fifty thousand silver coins,may i never boast of anything except the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world,1
4521,ACT,19,NRSV,so the word of the lord grew mightily and prevailed,and we are witnesses to these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him,1
4522,ACT,19,NRSV,now after these things had been accomplished paul resolved in the spirit to go through macedonia and achaia and then to go on to jerusalem,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law,1
4523,ACT,19,NRSV,he said after i have gone there i must also see rome,claiming to be wise they became fools and they exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or fourfooted animals or reptiles,1
4524,ACT,19,NRSV,so he sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus to macedonia while he himself stayed for some time longer in asia,those who observe the day observe it in honor of the lord,1
4525,ACT,19,NRSV,about that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the way, then each of them went home,1
4526,ACT,19,NRSV,a man named demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of artemis brought no little business to the artisans,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,1
4527,ACT,19,NRSV,these he gathered together with the workers of the same trade and said men you know that we get our wealth from this business,then pilate said to him do you not hear how many accusations they make against you,1
4528,ACT,19,NRSV,you also see and hear that not only in ephesus but in almost the whole of asia this paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat,1
4529,ACT,19,NRSV,and there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be scorned and she will be deprived of her majesty that brought all asia and the world to worship her,but jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to testify about anyone for he himself knew what was in everyone,1
4530,ACT,19,NRSV,when they heard this they were enraged and shouted great is artemis of the ephesians the city was filled with the confusion and people rushed together to the theater dragging with them gaius and aristarchus macedonians who were pauls travel companions,mary magdalene and the other mary were there sitting opposite the tomb,1
4531,ACT,19,NRSV,paul wished to go into the crowd but the disciples would not let him even some officials of the province of asia who were friendly to him sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater,all who obey his commandments abide in him and he abides in them,1
4532,ACT,19,NRSV,meanwhile some were shouting one thing some another for the assembly was in confusion and most of them did not know why they had come together,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,1
4533,ACT,19,NRSV,some of the crowd gave instructions to alexander whom the jews had pushed forward,as it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news but not all have obeyed the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message,1
4534,ACT,19,NRSV,and alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people,slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh,1
4535,ACT,19,NRSV,but when they recognized that he was a jew for about two hours all of them shouted in unison great is artemis of the ephesians but when the town clerk had quieted the crowd he said citizens of ephesus who is there that does not know that the city of the ephesians is the temple keeper of the great artemis and of the statue that fell from heaven,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss,1
4536,ACT,19,NRSV,since these things cannot be denied you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash,i do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith rather we are workers with you for your joy because you stand firm in the faith,1
4537,ACT,19,NRSV,you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess,as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast,1
4538,ACT,19,NRSV,if therefore demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them bring charges there against one another,then the devil left him and suddenly angels came and waited on him,1
4539,ACT,19,NRSV,if there is anything further you want to know it must be settled in the regular assembly,they will hunger no more and thirst no more the sun will not strike them nor any scorching heat for the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd and he will guide them to springs of the water of life and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes,1
4540,ACT,19,NRSV,for we are in danger of being charged with rioting today since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion,but some believers who belonged to the sect of the pharisees stood up and said it is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of moses,1
4541,ACT,19,NRSV,when he had said this he dismissed the assembly,if you do not wake up i will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour i will come to you,1
4542,ACT,20,NRSV,after the uproar had ceased paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them and saying farewell he left for macedonia,and no one after drinking old wine desires new wine but says the old is good,1
4543,ACT,20,NRSV,when he had gone through those regions and had given the believers much encouragement he came to greece where he stayed for three months,slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh,1
4544,ACT,20,NRSV,he was about to set sail for syria when a plot was made against him by the jews and so he decided to return through macedonia,for we cannot do anything against the truth but only for the truth,1
4545,ACT,20,NRSV,he was accompanied by sopater son of pyrrhus from beroea by aristarchus and secundus from thessalonica by gaius from derbe and by timothy as well as by tychicus and trophimus from asia,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us,1
4546,ACT,20,NRSV,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days,as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast,1
4547,ACT,20,NRSV,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight,from his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of god the almighty,1
4548,ACT,20,NRSV,there were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me,1
4549,ACT,20,NRSV,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer,for to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1
4550,ACT,20,NRSV,overcome by sleep he fell to the ground three floors below and was picked up dead,when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land,1
4551,ACT,20,NRSV,but paul went down and bending over him took him in his arms and said do not be alarmed for his life is in him,then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter,1
4552,ACT,20,NRSV,then paul went upstairs and after he had broken bread and eaten he continued to converse with them until dawn then he left,when the hour came he took his place at the table and the apostles with him,1
4553,ACT,20,NRSV,meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted,keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,1
4554,ACT,20,NRSV,we went ahead to the ship and set sail for assos intending to take paul on board there for he had made this arrangement intending to go by land himself,give no offense to jews or to greeks or to the church of god just as i try to please everyone in everything i do not seeking my own advantage but that of many so that they may be saved,1
4555,ACT,20,NRSV,when he met us in assos we took him on board and went to mitylene,but when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying go away from me lord for i am a sinful man for he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken and so also were james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon,1
4556,ACT,20,NRSV,we sailed from there and on the following day we arrived opposite chios,and they praised god saying then god has given even to the gentiles the repentance that leads to life,1
4557,ACT,20,NRSV,the next day we touched at samos and the day after that we came to miletus,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again,1
4558,ACT,20,NRSV,for paul had decided to sail past ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in asia he was eager to be in jerusalem if possible on the day of pentecost,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside,1
4559,ACT,20,NRSV,from miletus he sent a message to ephesus asking the elders of the church to meet him,jesus said to him if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,1
4560,ACT,20,NRSV,when they came to him he said to them you yourselves know how i lived among you the entire time from the first day that i set foot in asia serving the lord with all humility and with tears enduring the trials that came to me through the plots of the jews,has not the scripture said that the messiah is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived,1
4561,ACT,20,NRSV,i did not shrink from doing anything helpful proclaiming the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house as i testified to both jews and greeks about repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus,and pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother,1
4562,ACT,20,NRSV,and now as a captive to the spirit i am on my way to jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there except that the holy spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me,and jesus answered him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven,1
4563,ACT,20,NRSV,but i do not count my life of any value to myself if only i may finish my course and the ministry that i received from the lord jesus to testify to the good news of gods grace,i do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them for i came not to judge the world but to save the world,1
4564,ACT,20,NRSV,and now i know that none of you among whom i have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will ever see my face again,they were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall lowering him in a basket,1
4565,ACT,20,NRSV,therefore i declare to you this day that i am not responsible for the blood of any of you for i did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of god,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,1
4566,ACT,20,NRSV,keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock of which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god that he obtained with the blood of his own son,for the present form of this world is passing away,1
4567,ACT,20,NRSV,i know that after i have gone savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock,those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing,1
4568,ACT,20,NRSV,some even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them,now if i do what i do not want it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me,1
4569,ACT,20,NRSV,therefore be alert remembering that for three years i did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears,this was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet isaiah lord who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed,1
4570,ACT,20,NRSV,and now i commend you to god and to the message of his grace a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison,1
4571,ACT,20,NRSV,i coveted no ones silver or gold or clothing,when they heard this they were amazed and they left him and went away,1
4572,ACT,20,NRSV,you know for yourselves that i worked with my own hands to support myself and my companions,now the passover the festival of the jews was near,1
4573,ACT,20,NRSV,in all this i have given you an example that by such work we must support the weak remembering the words of the lord jesus for he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven,1
4574,ACT,20,NRSV,when he had finished speaking he knelt down with them all and prayed,examine yourselves and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup,1
4575,ACT,20,NRSV,there was much weeping among them all they embraced paul and kissed him grieving especially because of what he had said that they would not see him again,if you think that you are wise in this age you should become fools so that you may become wise,1
4576,ACT,20,NRSV,then they brought him to the ship,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,1
4577,ACT,21,NRSV,when we had parted from them and set sail we came by a straight course to cos and the next day to rhodes and from there to patara,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1
4578,ACT,21,NRSV,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail,every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god,1
4579,ACT,21,NRSV,we came in sight of cyprus and leaving it on our left we sailed to syria and landed at tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there,the disciples said to him where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd,1
4580,ACT,21,NRSV,we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days,and the world and its desire are passing away but those who do the will of god live forever,1
4581,ACT,21,NRSV,through the spirit they told paul not to go on to jerusalem,you blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup so that the outside also may become clean,1
4582,ACT,21,NRSV,when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey and all of them with wives and children escorted us outside the city,they answered john the baptist but others elijah and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen,1
4583,ACT,21,NRSV,there we knelt down on the beach and prayed and said farewell to one another,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good,1
4584,ACT,21,NRSV,then we went on board the ship and they returned home,philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed the messiah to them,1
4585,ACT,21,NRSV,when we had finished the voyage from tyre we arrived at ptolemais and we greeted the believers and stayed with them for one day,little children let no one deceive you,1
4586,ACT,21,NRSV,the next day we left and came to caesarea and we went into the house of philip the evangelist one of the seven and stayed with him,but if you are led by the spirit you are not subject to the law,1
4587,ACT,21,NRSV,he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy,no one when tempted should say i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one,1
4588,ACT,21,NRSV,while we were staying there for several days a prophet named agabus came down from judea,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food,1
4589,ACT,21,NRSV,he came to us and took pauls belt bound his own feet and hands with it and said thus says the holy spirit this is the way the jews in jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles,for people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boasters arrogant abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy inhuman implacable slanderers profligates brutes haters of good treacherous reckless swollen with conceit lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power,1
4590,ACT,21,NRSV,when we heard this we and the people there urged him not to go up to jerusalem,beloved we are gods children now what we will be has not yet been revealed,1
4591,ACT,21,NRSV,then paul answered what are you doing weeping and breaking my heart,truly i tell you people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit can never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin for they had said he has an unclean spirit,1
4592,ACT,21,NRSV,for i am ready not only to be bound but even to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus,so then friends we are children not of the slave but of the free woman,1
4593,ACT,21,NRSV,since he would not be persuaded we remained silent except to say the lords will be done,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,1
4594,ACT,21,NRSV,after these days we got ready and started to go up to jerusalem,jesus answered you say that i am a king,1
4595,ACT,21,NRSV,some of the disciples from caesarea also came along and brought us to the house of mnason of cyprus an early disciple with whom we were to stay,his name in the first place means king of righteousness next he is also king of salem that is king of peace,1
4596,ACT,21,NRSV,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly,then he said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath,1
4597,ACT,21,NRSV,the next day paul went with us to visit james and all the elders were present,jesus said to them i am the bread of life,1
4598,ACT,21,NRSV,after greeting them he related one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry,one day as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders and said to him tell us by what authority are you doing these things,1
4599,ACT,21,NRSV,when they heard it they praised god,people were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them and the disciples spoke sternly to them,1
4600,ACT,21,NRSV,then they said to him you see brother how many thousands of believers there are among the jews and they are all zealous for the law,and they praised god saying then god has given even to the gentiles the repentance that leads to life,1
4601,ACT,21,NRSV,they have been told about you that you teach all the jews living among the gentiles to forsake moses and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs,it is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times and not only when i am present with you,1
4602,ACT,21,NRSV,what then is to be done,many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist be on your guard so that you do not lose what we have worked for but may receive a full reward,1
4603,ACT,21,NRSV,they will certainly hear that you have come,look your father and i have been searching for you in great anxiety,1
4604,ACT,21,NRSV,so do what we tell you,they should sing songs of praise,1
4605,ACT,21,NRSV,we have four men who are under a vow,then beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures,1
4606,ACT,21,NRSV,join these men go through the rite of purification with them and pay for the shaving of their heads,immediately they regained their sight and followed him,1
4607,ACT,21,NRSV,thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself observe and guard the law,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law,1
4608,ACT,21,NRSV,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire,1
4609,ACT,21,NRSV,then paul took the men and the next day having purified himself he entered the temple with them making public the completion of the days of purification when the sacrifice would be made for each of them,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him,1
4610,ACT,21,NRSV,when the seven days were almost completed the jews from asia who had seen him in the temple stirred up the whole crowd,we welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude,1
4611,ACT,21,NRSV,they seized him shouting fellow israelites help this is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people our law and this place more than that he has actually brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place,we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days,1
4612,ACT,21,NRSV,for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with him in the city and they supposed that paul had brought him into the temple,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love,1
4613,ACT,21,NRSV,then all the city was aroused and the people rushed together,and he said to her what do you want,1
4614,ACT,21,NRSV,they seized paul and dragged him out of the temple and immediately the doors were shut,he said to it may no one ever eat fruit from you again,1
4615,ACT,21,NRSV,while they were trying to kill him word came to the tribune of the cohort that all jerusalem was in an uproar,those who are spiritual discern all things and they are themselves subject to no one elses scrutiny,1
4616,ACT,21,NRSV,immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them,and his disciples said to him you see the crowd pressing in on you how can you say who touched me,1
4617,ACT,21,NRSV,when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication,1
4618,ACT,21,NRSV,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done,then pilate wondered if he were already dead and summoning the centurion he asked him whether he had been dead for some time,1
4619,ACT,21,NRSV,some in the crowd shouted one thing some another and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar he ordered him to be brought into the barracks,apart from the law sin lies dead,1
4620,ACT,21,NRSV,when paul came to the steps the violence of the mob was so great that he had to be carried by the soldiers,and the ten horns that you saw they and the beast will hate the whore they will make her desolate and naked they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,1
4621,ACT,21,NRSV,the crowd that followed kept shouting away with him just as paul was about to be brought into the barracks he said to the tribune may i say something to you,in his right hand he held seven stars and from his mouth came a sharp twoedged sword and his face was like the sun shining with full force,1
4622,ACT,21,NRSV,the tribune replied do you know greek,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1
4623,ACT,21,NRSV,then you are not the egyptian who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness,they compelled a passerby who was coming in from the country to carry his cross it was simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus,1
4624,ACT,21,NRSV,paul replied i am a jew from tarsus in cilicia a citizen of an important city i beg you let me speak to the people,and if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another who will give you what is your own,1
4625,ACT,21,NRSV,when he had given him permission paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence and when there was a great hush he addressed them in the hebrew language saying,what then are we to say about these things,1
4626,ACT,22,NRSV,brothers and fathers listen to the defense that i now make before you,so jesus called them and said to them you know that among the gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them,1
4627,ACT,22,NRSV,when they heard him addressing them in hebrew they became even more quiet,someone asked him lord will only a few be saved,1
4628,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said i am a jew born in tarsus in cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel educated strictly according to our ancestral law being zealous for god just as all of you are today,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them,1
4629,ACT,22,NRSV,i persecuted this way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me,but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty,1
4630,ACT,22,NRSV,from them i also received letters to the brothers in damascus and i went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to jerusalem for punishment,but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to the emperoreven though i had no charge to bring against my nation,1
4631,ACT,22,NRSV,while i was on my way and approaching damascus about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me,the eye is the lamp of the body,1
4632,ACT,22,NRSV,i fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me saul saul why are you persecuting me,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah remains forever,1
4633,ACT,22,NRSV,i answered who are you lord,but if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it out of consideration for the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience i mean the others conscience not your own,1
4634,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are persecuting,should we sin because we are not under law but under grace,1
4635,ACT,22,NRSV,now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast,1
4636,ACT,22,NRSV,i asked what am i to do lord,now it is not necessary for me to write you about the ministry to the saints for i know your eagerness which is the subject of my boasting about you to the people of macedonia saying that achaia has been ready since last year and your zeal has stirred up most of them,1
4637,ACT,22,NRSV,the lord said to me get up and go to damascus there you will be told everything that has been assigned to you to do,for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death,1
4638,ACT,22,NRSV,since i could not see because of the brightness of that light those who were with me took my hand and led me to damascus,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost and so are the skins but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins,1
4639,ACT,22,NRSV,a certain ananias who was a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the jews living there came to me and standing beside me he said brother saul regain your sight in that very hour i regained my sight and saw him,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well,1
4640,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said the god of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will to see the righteous one and to hear his own voice for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,1
4641,ACT,22,NRSV,and now why do you delay,there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love,1
4642,ACT,22,NRSV,get up be baptized and have your sins washed away calling on his name,but now i am coming to you and i speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves,1
4643,ACT,22,NRSV,after i had returned to jerusalem and while i was praying in the temple i fell into a trance and saw jesus saying to me hurry and get out of jerusalem quickly because they will not accept your testimony about me,then all the disciples deserted him and fled,1
4644,ACT,22,NRSV,and i said lord they themselves know that in every synagogue i imprisoned and beat those who believed in you,see i am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves,1
4645,ACT,22,NRSV,and while the blood of your witness stephen was shed i myself was standing by approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him,his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation,1
4646,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles,and he said truly i tell you no prophet is accepted in the prophets hometown,1
4647,ACT,22,NRSV,up to this point they listened to him but then they shouted away with such a fellow from the earth for he should not be allowed to live,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god,1
4648,ACT,22,NRSV,and while they were shouting throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks and ordered him to be examined by flogging to find out the reason for this outcry against him,the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask is this not the man who used to sit and beg,1
4649,ACT,22,NRSV,but when they had tied him up with thongs paul said to the centurion who was standing by is it legal for you to flog a roman citizen who is uncondemned,by faith jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of joseph bowing in worship over the top of his staff,1
4650,ACT,22,NRSV,when the centurion heard that he went to the tribune and said to him what are you about to do,what i am saying in regard to this boastful confidence i am saying not with the lords authority but as a fool since many boast according to human standards i will also boast,1
4651,ACT,22,NRSV,this man is a roman citizen,through the spirit they told paul not to go on to jerusalem,1
4652,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune came and asked paul tell me are you a roman citizen,immediately she fell down at his feet and died,1
4653,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune answered it cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer,1
4654,ACT,22,NRSV,paul said but i was born a citizen,nathanael replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel jesus answered do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree,1
4655,ACT,22,NRSV,immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him and the tribune also was afraid for he realized that paul was a roman citizen and that he had bound him,then he said to them is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to kill,1
4656,ACT,22,NRSV,since he wanted to find out what paul was being accused of by the jews the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet,all must test their own work then that work rather than their neighbors work will become a cause for pride,1
4657,ACT,22,NRSV,he brought paul down and had him stand before them,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed,1
4658,ACT,23,NRSV,while paul was looking intently at the council he said brothers up to this day i have lived my life with a clear conscience before god,the swineherds ran off and on going into the town they told the whole story about what had happened to the demoniacs,1
4659,ACT,23,NRSV,then the high priest ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth,jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me,1
4660,ACT,23,NRSV,at this paul said to him god will strike you you whitewashed wall are you sitting there to judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck,then joseph bought a linen cloth and taking down the body wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock,1
4661,ACT,23,NRSV,those standing nearby said do you dare to insult gods high priest,i am not aware of anything against myself but i am not thereby acquitted,1
4662,ACT,23,NRSV,and paul said i did not realize brothers that he was high priest for it is written you shall not speak evil of a leader of your people,then pilate took jesus and had him flogged,1
4663,ACT,23,NRSV,when paul noticed that some were sadducees and others were pharisees he called out in the council brothers i am a pharisee a son of pharisees,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,1
4664,ACT,23,NRSV,i am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead,when jesus said to them i am he they stepped back and fell to the ground,1
4665,ACT,23,NRSV,when he said this a dissension began between the pharisees and the sadducees and the assembly was divided,listen i paul am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you,1
4666,ACT,23,NRSV,the sadducees say that there is no resurrection or angel or spirit but the pharisees acknowledge all three then a great clamor arose and certain scribes of the pharisees group stood up and contended we find nothing wrong with this man,he brought paul down and had him stand before them,1
4667,ACT,23,NRSV,what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him,to those under the law i became as one under the law though i myself am not under the law so that i might win those under the law,1
4668,ACT,23,NRSV,when the dissension became violent the tribune fearing that they would tear paul to pieces ordered the soldiers to go down take him by force and bring him into the barracks,as he stepped out on land a man of the city who had demons met him,1
4669,ACT,23,NRSV,that night the lord stood near him and said keep up your courage for just as you have testified for me in jerusalem so you must bear witness also in rome,thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins but gods wrath has overtaken them at last,1
4670,ACT,23,NRSV,in the morning the jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed paul,thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors and has remembered his holy covenant the oath that he swore to our ancestor abraham to grant us that we being rescued from the hands of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days,1
4671,ACT,23,NRSV,there were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy,sell your possessions and give alms,1
4672,ACT,23,NRSV,they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed paul,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,1
4673,ACT,23,NRSV,now then you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case,so they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to iconium,1
4674,ACT,23,NRSV,and we are ready to do away with him before he arrives,and the servant was healed in that hour,1
4675,ACT,23,NRSV,now the son of pauls sister heard about the ambush so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told paul,jesus straightened up and said to her woman where are they,1
4676,ACT,23,NRSV,paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the tribune for he has something to report to him,the day was drawing to a close and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and get provisions for we are here in a deserted place,1
4677,ACT,23,NRSV,so he took him brought him to the tribune and said the prisoner paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you he has something to tell you,and after they had appointed elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had come to believe,1
4678,ACT,23,NRSV,the tribune took him by the hand drew him aside privately and asked what is it that you have to report to me,the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were spellbound by what they heard,1
4679,ACT,23,NRSV,he answered the jews have agreed to ask you to bring paul down to the council tomorrow as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into his case,for they speak bombastic nonsense and with licentious desires of the flesh they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error,1
4680,ACT,23,NRSV,but do not be persuaded by them for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him,the people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this and after they had taken bail from jason and the others they let them go,1
4681,ACT,23,NRSV,they have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him,is the law then opposed to the promises of god,1
4682,ACT,23,NRSV,they are ready now and are waiting for your consent,but the angel said to me why are you so amazed,1
4683,ACT,23,NRSV,so the tribune dismissed the young man ordering him tell no one that you have informed me of this,they went away and found a colt tied near a door outside in the street,1
4684,ACT,23,NRSV,then he summoned two of the centurions and said get ready to leave by nine oclock tonight for caesarea with two hundred soldiers seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen,but now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to god the advantage you get is sanctification,1
4685,ACT,23,NRSV,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor,so she went home found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone,1
4686,ACT,23,NRSV,he wrote a letter to this effect claudius lysias to his excellency the governor felix greetings,and jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them can they,1
4687,ACT,23,NRSV,this man was seized by the jews and was about to be killed by them but when i had learned that he was a roman citizen i came with the guard and rescued him,he said to them you say that i am,1
4688,ACT,23,NRSV,since i wanted to know the charge for which they accused him i had him brought to their council,now concerning the matters about which you wrote it is well for a man not to touch a woman,1
4689,ACT,23,NRSV,i found that he was accused concerning questions of their law but was charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment,he did not wish to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him,1
4690,ACT,23,NRSV,when i was informed that there would be a plot against the man i sent him to you at once ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him,the purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor abraham had before he was circumcised,1
4691,ACT,23,NRSV,so the soldiers according to their instructions took paul and brought him during the night to antipatris,remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show every courtesy to everyone,1
4692,ACT,23,NRSV,the next day they let the horsemen go on with him while they returned to the barracks,you are those who have stood by me in my trials and i confer on you just as my father has conferred on me a kingdom so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,1
4693,ACT,23,NRSV,when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they presented paul also before him,jesus said to them truly i tell you at the renewal of all things when the son of man is seated on the throne of his glory you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,1
4694,ACT,23,NRSV,on reading the letter he asked what province he belonged to and when he learned that he was from cilicia he said i will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive,although you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy for you are receiving the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls,1
4695,ACT,23,NRSV,then he ordered that he be kept under guard in herods headquarters,but when the pharisees heard it they said it is only by beelzebul the ruler of the demons that this fellow casts out the demons,1
4696,ACT,24,NRSV,five days later the high priest ananias came down with some elders and an attorney a certain tertullus and they reported their case against paul to the governor,for who has known the mind of the lord so as to instruct him,1
4697,ACT,24,NRSV,when paul had been summoned tertullus began to accuse him saying your excellency because of you we have long enjoyed peace and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight,but the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating,1
4698,ACT,24,NRSV,we welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account,1
4699,ACT,24,NRSV,but to detain you no further i beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness,jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid because i know where i have come from and where i am going but you do not know where i come from or where i am going,1
4700,ACT,24,NRSV,we have in fact found this man a pestilent fellow an agitator among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes,by faith joseph at the end of his life made mention of the exodus of the israelites and gave instructions about his burial,1
4701,ACT,24,NRSV,he even tried to profane the temple and so we seized him,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded,1
4702,ACT,24,NRSV,by examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder,1
4703,ACT,24,NRSV,the jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true,then all the people of the surrounding country of the gerasenes asked jesus to leave them for they were seized with great fear,1
4704,ACT,24,NRSV,when the governor motioned to him to speak paul replied i cheerfully make my defense knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation,they were astounded at his teaching because he spoke with authority,1
4705,ACT,24,NRSV,as you can find out it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship in jerusalem,accursed children they have left the straight road and have gone astray following the road of balaam son of bosor who loved the wages of doing wrong but was rebuked for his own transgression a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophets madness,1
4706,ACT,24,NRSV,they did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city,it sounds rather strange to us so we would like to know what it means,1
4707,ACT,24,NRSV,neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor,1
4708,ACT,24,NRSV,but this i admit to you that according to the way which they call a sect i worship the god of our ancestors believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets,but i ask have they not heard,1
4709,ACT,24,NRSV,i have a hope in goda hope that they themselves also acceptthat there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous,everyone who does not abide in the teaching of christ but goes beyond it does not have god whoever abides in the teaching has both the father and the son,1
4710,ACT,24,NRSV,therefore i do my best always to have a clear conscience toward god and all people,when they came to jesus they appealed to him earnestly saying he is worthy of having you do this for him for he loves our people and it is he who built our synagogue for us,1
4711,ACT,24,NRSV,now after some years i came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices,let both of them grow together until the harvest and at harvest time i will tell the reapers collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn,1
4712,ACT,24,NRSV,while i was doing this they found me in the temple completing the rite of purification without any crowd or disturbance,i am reminded of your sincere faith a faith that lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and now i am sure lives in you,1
4713,ACT,24,NRSV,but there were some jews from asiathey ought to be here before you to make an accusation if they have anything against me,and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith,1
4714,ACT,24,NRSV,or let these men here tell what crime they had found when i stood before the council unless it was this one sentence that i called out while standing before them it is about the resurrection of the dead that i am on trial before you today,then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs,1
4715,ACT,24,NRSV,but felix who was rather well informed about the way adjourned the hearing with the comment when lysias the tribune comes down i will decide your case,and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,1
4716,ACT,24,NRSV,then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs,you brood of vipers how can you speak good things when you are evil,1
4717,ACT,24,NRSV,some days later when felix came with his wife drusilla who was jewish he sent for paul and heard him speak concerning faith in christ jesus,finally brothers and sisters we ask and urge you in the lord jesus that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please god as in fact you are doing you should do so more and more,1
4718,ACT,24,NRSV,and as he discussed justice selfcontrol and the coming judgment felix became frightened and said go away for the present when i have an opportunity i will send for you,when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch,1
4719,ACT,24,NRSV,at the same time he hoped that money would be given him by paul and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him,whoever is from god hears the words of god,1
4720,ACT,24,NRSV,after two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and since he wanted to grant the jews a favor felix left paul in prison,when the high priest and those with him arrived they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought,1
4721,ACT,25,NRSV,three days after festus had arrived in the province he went up from caesarea to jerusalem where the chief priests and the leaders of the jews gave him a report against paul,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first,1
4722,ACT,25,NRSV,they appealed to him and requested as a favor to them against paul to have him transferred to jerusalem,on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold their faces were like human faces their hair like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth they had scales like iron breastplates and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle,1
4723,ACT,25,NRSV,they were in fact planning an ambush to kill him along the way,he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly and argued persuasively about the kingdom of god,1
4724,ACT,25,NRSV,festus replied that paul was being kept at caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly,these are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast they will make war on the lamb and the lamb will conquer them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those with him are called and chosen and faithful,1
4725,ACT,25,NRSV,so he said let those of you who have the authority come down with me and if there is anything wrong about the man let them accuse him,for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and they say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds,1
4726,ACT,25,NRSV,after he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days he went down to caesarea the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered paul to be brought,then i heard a loud voice in heaven proclaiming now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his messiah for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down who accuses them day and night before our god,1
4727,ACT,25,NRSV,when he arrived the jews who had gone down from jerusalem surrounded him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove,grace be with all of you,1
4728,ACT,25,NRSV,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor,if you walk in the darkness you do not know where you are going,1
4729,ACT,25,NRSV,but festus wishing to do the jews a favor asked paul do you wish to go up to jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them,1
4730,ACT,25,NRSV,paul said i am appealing to the emperors tribunal this is where i should be tried,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,1
4731,ACT,25,NRSV,i have done no wrong to the jews as you very well know,but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive opinions,1
4732,ACT,25,NRSV,now if i am in the wrong and have committed something for which i deserve to die i am not trying to escape death but if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can turn me over to them,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth,1
4733,ACT,25,NRSV,then festus after he had conferred with his council replied you have appealed to the emperor to the emperor you will go,then opening their treasure chests they offered him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh,1
4734,ACT,25,NRSV,after several days had passed king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea to welcome festus,just so i tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents,1
4735,ACT,25,NRSV,since they were staying there several days festus laid pauls case before the king saying there is a man here who was left in prison by felix,it is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound such as the flute or the harp,1
4736,ACT,25,NRSV,when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us,1
4737,ACT,25,NRSV,i told them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge,tell me so that i may believe in him,1
4738,ACT,25,NRSV,so when they met here i lost no time but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing,1
4739,ACT,25,NRSV,when the accusers stood up they did not charge him with any of the crimes that i was expecting,he gave her his hand and helped her up,1
4740,ACT,25,NRSV,instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain jesus who had died but whom paul asserted to be alive,for what have i to do with judging those outside,1
4741,ACT,25,NRSV,since i was at a loss how to investigate these questions i asked whether he wished to go to jerusalem and be tried there on these charges,but in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year,1
4742,ACT,25,NRSV,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink,1
4743,ACT,25,NRSV,agrippa said to festus i would like to hear the man myself,he answered you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself,1
4744,ACT,25,NRSV,tomorrow he said you will hear him,as they left the council they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name,1
4745,ACT,25,NRSV,so on the next day agrippa and bernice came with great pomp and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city,but of israel he says all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people,1
4746,ACT,25,NRSV,then festus gave the order and paul was brought in,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,1
4747,ACT,25,NRSV,and festus said king agrippa and all here present with us you see this man about whom the whole jewish community petitioned me both in jerusalem and here shouting that he ought not to live any longer,when he heard that jesus had come from judea to galilee he went and begged him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,1
4748,ACT,25,NRSV,but i found that he had done nothing deserving death and when he appealed to his imperial majesty i decided to send him,but i do not count my life of any value to myself if only i may finish my course and the ministry that i received from the lord jesus to testify to the good news of gods grace,1
4749,ACT,25,NRSV,but i have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him,and once more he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they did not know what to say to him,1
4750,ACT,25,NRSV,therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that after we have examined him i may have something to write for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him,greet rufus chosen in the lord and greet his mothera mother to me also,1
4751,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul you have permission to speak for yourself,the angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls,1
4752,ACT,26,NRSV,then paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself i consider myself fortunate that it is before you king agrippa i am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the jews because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the jews therefore i beg of you to listen to me patiently,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us,1
4753,ACT,26,NRSV,all the jews know my way of life from my youth a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in jerusalem,and the spirit is the one that testifies for the spirit is the truth,1
4754,ACT,26,NRSV,they have known for a long time if they are willing to testify that i have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a pharisee,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god,1
4755,ACT,26,NRSV,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night,we have four men who are under a vow,1
4756,ACT,26,NRSV,it is for this hope your excellency that i am accused by jews why is it thought incredible by any of you that god raises the dead,peter answered the messiah of god,1
4757,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed i myself was convinced that i ought to do many things against the name of jesus of nazareth,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1
4758,ACT,26,NRSV,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,1
4759,ACT,26,NRSV,by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to blaspheme and since i was so furiously enraged at them i pursued them even to foreign cities,but peter said to him may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain gods gift with money you have no part or share in this for your heart is not right before god,1
4760,ACT,26,NRSV,with this in mind i was traveling to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests when at midday along the road your excellency i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions,you have already been cleansed by the word that i have spoken to you,1
4761,ACT,26,NRSV,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory,1
4762,ACT,26,NRSV,it hurts you to kick against the goads,so when they met here i lost no time but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought,1
4763,ACT,26,NRSV,i asked who are you lord,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,1
4764,ACT,26,NRSV,the lord answered i am jesus whom you are persecuting,then looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him ephphatha that is be opened,1
4765,ACT,26,NRSV,but get up and stand on your feet for i have appeared to you for this purpose to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which i will appear to you,like good stewards of the manifold grace of god serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received,1
4766,ACT,26,NRSV,i will rescue you from your people and from the gentilesto whom i am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me,truly i tell you not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down,1
4767,ACT,26,NRSV,after that king agrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but declared first to those in damascus then in jerusalem and throughout the countryside of judea and also to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do deeds consistent with repentance,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,1
4768,ACT,26,NRSV,for this reason the jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me,he set this aside nailing it to the cross,1
4769,ACT,26,NRSV,to this day i have had help from god and so i stand here testifying to both small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would take place that the messiah must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the gentiles,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea,1
4770,ACT,26,NRSV,while he was making this defense festus exclaimed you are out of your mind paul too much learning is driving you insane but paul said i am not out of my mind most excellent festus but i am speaking the sober truth,he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful in you,1
4771,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed the king knows about these things and to him i speak freely for i am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice for this was not done in a corner,yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies,1
4772,ACT,26,NRSV,king agrippa do you believe the prophets,then jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last,1
4773,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul are you so quickly persuading me to become a christian,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink,1
4774,ACT,26,NRSV,paul replied whether quickly or not i pray to god that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as i amexcept for these chains,while they were talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you,1
4775,ACT,26,NRSV,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment,so they came to him in a body and after winning over blastus the kings chamberlain they asked for a reconciliation because their country depended on the kings country for food,1
4776,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to festus this man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor,i wrapped it up in a piece of cloth for i was afraid of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow,1
4777,ACT,27,NRSV,when it was decided that we were to sail for italy they transferred paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the augustan cohort named julius,but whoever hates another believer is in the darkness walks in the darkness and does not know the way to go because the darkness has brought on blindness,1
4778,ACT,27,NRSV,embarking on a ship of adramyttium that was about to set sail to the ports along the coast of asia we put to sea accompanied by aristarchus a macedonian from thessalonica,but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth,1
4779,ACT,27,NRSV,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for,when the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy and he fell on the ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth,1
4780,ACT,27,NRSV,putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of cyprus because the winds were against us,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,1
4781,ACT,27,NRSV,after we had sailed across the sea that is off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia,the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become a loaf of bread,1
4782,ACT,27,NRSV,there the centurion found an alexandrian ship bound for italy and put us on board,slaves obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as you obey christ not only while being watched and in order to please them but as slaves of christ doing the will of god from the heart,1
4783,ACT,27,NRSV,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone,peter said to him even though all become deserters i will not,1
4784,ACT,27,NRSV,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea,what has become of the goodwill you felt,1
4785,ACT,27,NRSV,since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous because even the fast had already gone by paul advised them saying sirs i can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives,it is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are virgins these follow the lamb wherever he goes,1
4786,ACT,27,NRSV,but the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what paul said,and jesus said you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother also you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1
4787,ACT,27,NRSV,since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach phoenix where they could spend the winter,those who believe in me even though they die will live and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die,1
4788,ACT,27,NRSV,it was a harbor of crete facing southwest and northwest,for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp,1
4789,ACT,27,NRSV,when a moderate south wind began to blow they thought they could achieve their purpose so they weighed anchor and began to sail past crete close to the shore,the tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity it stains the whole body sets on fire the cycle of nature and is itself set on fire by hell,1
4790,ACT,27,NRSV,but soon a violent wind called the northeaster rushed down from crete,then joseph got up took the child and his mother by night and went to egypt and remained there until the death of herod,1
4791,ACT,27,NRSV,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven,by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin,1
4792,ACT,27,NRSV,by running under the lee of a small island called cauda we were scarcely able to get the ships boat under control,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1
4793,ACT,27,NRSV,after hoisting it up they took measures to undergird the ship then fearing that they would run on the syrtis they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven,in speaking of a new covenant he has made the first one obsolete,1
4794,ACT,27,NRSV,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money,1
4795,ACT,27,NRSV,when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small tempest raged all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned,for we know the one who said vengeance is mine i will repay,1
4796,ACT,27,NRSV,since they had been without food for a long time paul then stood up among them and said men you should have listened to me and not have set sail from crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss,and we do this so that we may not be outwitted by satan for we are not ignorant of his designs,1
4797,ACT,27,NRSV,i urge you now to keep up your courage for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship,for if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries,1
4798,ACT,27,NRSV,for last night there stood by me an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i worship and he said do not be afraid paul you must stand before the emperor and indeed god has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you,now he is god not of the dead but of the living for to him all of them are alive,1
4799,ACT,27,NRSV,so keep up your courage men for i have faith in god that it will be exactly as i have been told,if it bears fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down,1
4800,ACT,27,NRSV,but we will have to run aground on some island,pray also for me so that when i speak a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains,1
4801,ACT,27,NRSV,when the fourteenth night had come as we were drifting across the sea of adria about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land,after we had reached safety we then learned that the island was called malta,1
4802,ACT,27,NRSV,so they took soundings and found twenty fathoms a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms,all of them said let him be crucified then he asked why what evil has he done,1
4803,ACT,27,NRSV,fearing that we might run on the rocks they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come,for you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us we were not idle when we were with you and we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you,1
4804,ACT,27,NRSV,but when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow paul said to the centurion and the soldiers unless these men stay in the ship you cannot be saved,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves,1
4805,ACT,27,NRSV,then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them,1
4806,ACT,27,NRSV,just before daybreak paul urged all of them to take some food saying today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and remaining without food having eaten nothing,he called out with a mighty voice fallen fallen is babylon the great it has become a dwelling place of demons a haunt of every foul spirit a haunt of every foul bird a haunt of every foul and hateful beast,1
4807,ACT,27,NRSV,therefore i urge you to take some food for it will help you survive for none of you will lose a hair from your heads,how can we thank god enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our god because of you,1
4808,ACT,27,NRSV,after he had said this he took bread and giving thanks to god in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover,1
4809,ACT,27,NRSV,then all of them were encouraged and took food for themselves,but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison doors brought them out and said go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life,1
4810,ACT,27,NRSV,we were in all two hundred seventysix persons in the ship after they had satisfied their hunger they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
4811,ACT,27,NRSV,in the morning they did not recognize the land but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if they could,you also see and hear that not only in ephesus but in almost the whole of asia this paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods,1
4812,ACT,27,NRSV,so they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea,i went up in response to a revelation,1
4813,ACT,27,NRSV,at the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steeringoars then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach,he proclaimed the one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals,1
4814,ACT,27,NRSV,but striking a reef they ran the ship aground the bow stuck and remained immovable but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves,even tax collectors came to be baptized and they asked him teacher what should we do,1
4815,ACT,27,NRSV,the soldiers plan was to kill the prisoners so that none might swim away and escape but the centurion wishing to save paul kept them from carrying out their plan,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,1
4816,ACT,27,NRSV,he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land and the rest to follow some on planks and others on pieces of the ship,day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me,1
4817,ACT,27,NRSV,and so it was that all were brought safely to land,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god,1
4818,ACT,28,NRSV,after we had reached safety we then learned that the island was called malta,how have you been worse off than the other churches except that i myself did not burden you,1
4819,ACT,28,NRSV,the natives showed us unusual kindness,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you,1
4820,ACT,28,NRSV,since it had begun to rain and was cold they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us around it,do you not realize that jesus christ is in youunless indeed you fail to meet the test i hope you will find out that we have not failed,1
4821,ACT,28,NRSV,paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law,1
4822,ACT,28,NRSV,when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand they said to one another this man must be a murderer though he has escaped from the sea justice has not allowed him to live,no one comes to the father except through me,1
4823,ACT,28,NRSV,he however shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm,pilate replied i am not a jew am i,1
4824,ACT,28,NRSV,they were expecting him to swell up or drop dead but after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing unusual had happened to him they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god,the great dragon was thrown down that ancient serpent who is called the devil and satan the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him,1
4825,ACT,28,NRSV,now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island named publius who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days,but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king,1
4826,ACT,28,NRSV,it so happened that the father of publius lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery,if i partake with thankfulness why should i be denounced because of that for which i give thanks,1
4827,ACT,28,NRSV,paul visited him and cured him by praying and putting his hands on him,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life,1
4828,ACT,28,NRSV,after this happened the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured,so deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own selves because you have become very dear to us,1
4829,ACT,28,NRSV,they bestowed many honors on us and when we were about to sail they put on board all the provisions we needed,now those who were scattered went from place to place proclaiming the word,1
4830,ACT,28,NRSV,three months later we set sail on a ship that had wintered at the island an alexandrian ship with the twin brothers as its figurehead,when the seven days were almost completed the jews from asia who had seen him in the temple stirred up the whole crowd,1
4831,ACT,28,NRSV,we put in at syracuse and stayed there for three days then we weighed anchor and came to rhegium,indeed we call blessed those who showed endurance,1
4832,ACT,28,NRSV,after one day there a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to puteoli,then the disciples returned to their homes,1
4833,ACT,28,NRSV,there we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days,a certain woman named lydia a worshiper of god was listening to us she was from the city of thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth,1
4834,ACT,28,NRSV,and so we came to rome,when it was evening there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who was also a disciple of jesus,1
4835,ACT,28,NRSV,the believers from there when they heard of us came as far as the forum of appius and three taverns to meet us,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside,1
4836,ACT,28,NRSV,on seeing them paul thanked god and took courage,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,1
4837,ACT,28,NRSV,when we came into rome paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him,for all must carry their own loads,1
4838,ACT,28,NRSV,three days later he called together the local leaders of the jews,then jesus filled with the power of the spirit returned to galilee and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country,1
4839,ACT,28,NRSV,when they had assembled he said to them brothers though i had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors yet i was arrested in jerusalem and handed over to the romans,but let none of you suffer as a murderer a thief a criminal or even as a mischief maker,1
4840,ACT,28,NRSV,when they had examined me the romans wanted to release me because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case,and the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning they will stand far off in fear of her torment and say alas alas the great city babylon the mighty city for in one hour your judgment has come,1
4841,ACT,28,NRSV,but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to the emperoreven though i had no charge to bring against my nation,yes and i will continue to rejoice for i know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ this will turn out for my deliverance,1
4842,ACT,28,NRSV,for this reason therefore i have asked to see you and speak with you since it is for the sake of the hope of israel that i am bound with this chain,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,1
4843,ACT,28,NRSV,they replied we have received no letters from judea about you and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you,he came out and went as was his custom to the mount of olives and the disciples followed him,1
4844,ACT,28,NRSV,but we would like to hear from you what you think for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against,and many believed in him there,1
4845,ACT,28,NRSV,after they had set a day to meet with him they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers,and so said all the disciples,1
4846,ACT,28,NRSV,from morning until evening he explained the matter to them testifying to the kingdom of god and trying to convince them about jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets,for truly i tell you until heaven and earth pass away not one letter not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished,1
4847,ACT,28,NRSV,some were convinced by what he had said while others refused to believe,we have therefore sent judas and silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth,1
4848,ACT,28,NRSV,so they disagreed with each other and as they were leaving paul made one further statement the holy spirit was right in saying to your ancestors through the prophet isaiah go to this people and say you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive,this is the third time i am coming to you,1
4849,ACT,28,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did and heard the children crying out in the temple hosanna to the son of david they became angry and said to him do you hear what these are saying,1
4850,ACT,28,NRSV,let it be known to you then that this salvation of god has been sent to the gentiles they will listen,now a certain man was ill lazarus of bethany the village of mary and her sister martha,1
4851,ACT,28,NRSV,he lived there two whole years at his own expense and welcomed all who came to him proclaiming the kingdom of god and teaching about the lord jesus christ with all boldness and without hindrance,but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return,1
4852,ROM,1,NRSV,paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow afterward,1
4853,ROM,1,NRSV,first i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you because your faith is proclaimed throughout the world,consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them,1
4854,ROM,1,NRSV,for god whom i serve with my spirit by announcing the gospel of his son is my witness that without ceasing i remember you always in my prayers asking that by gods will i may somehow at last succeed in coming to you,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him,1
4855,ROM,1,NRSV,for i am longing to see you so that i may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you or rather so that we may be mutually encouraged by each others faith both yours and mine,but when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat,1
4856,ROM,1,NRSV,i want you to know brothers and sisters that i have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented in order that i may reap some harvest among you as i have among the rest of the gentiles,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments,1
4857,ROM,1,NRSV,i am a debtor both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish hence my eagerness to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in rome,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were amazed and recognized them as companions of jesus,1
4858,ROM,1,NRSV,for i am not ashamed of the gospel it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and also to the greek,now jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book,1
4859,ROM,1,NRSV,for in it the righteousness of god is revealed through faith for faith as it is written the one who is righteous will live by faith,philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed the messiah to them,1
4860,ROM,1,NRSV,for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those who by their wickedness suppress the truth,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place,1
4861,ROM,1,NRSV,for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them,for you do not go in yourselves and when others are going in you stop them,1
4862,ROM,1,NRSV,ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature invisible though they are have been understood and seen through the things he has made,of these things we cannot speak now in detail,1
4863,ROM,1,NRSV,so they are without excuse for though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep,1
4864,ROM,1,NRSV,claiming to be wise they became fools and they exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or fourfooted animals or reptiles,you know for yourselves that i worked with my own hands to support myself and my companions,1
4865,ROM,1,NRSV,therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the degrading of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen,they shouted in reply not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a bandit,1
4866,ROM,1,NRSV,for this reason god gave them up to degrading passions,david himself calls him lord so how can he be his son,1
4867,ROM,1,NRSV,their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural and in the same way also the men giving up natural intercourse with women were consumed with passion for one another,this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of god but the children of the promise are counted as descendants,1
4868,ROM,1,NRSV,men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error,those who say i love god and hate their brothers or sisters are liars for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen cannot love god whom they have not seen,1
4869,ROM,1,NRSV,and since they did not see fit to acknowledge god god gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done,he said to them but who do you say that i am,1
4870,ROM,1,NRSV,they were filled with every kind of wickedness evil covetousness malice,then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and on my return i would have received what was my own with interest,1
4871,ROM,1,NRSV,full of envy murder strife deceit craftiness they are gossips slanderers godhaters insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil rebellious toward parents foolish faithless heartless ruthless,in former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that is the gentiles have become fellow heirs members of the same body and sharers in the promise in christ jesus through the gospel,1
4872,ROM,1,NRSV,they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to dieyet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death,1
4873,ROM,2,NRSV,therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things,there were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy,1
4874,ROM,2,NRSV,you say we know that gods judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth,for ever since our ancestors died all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation they deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of god heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished,1
4875,ROM,2,NRSV,do you imagine whoever you are that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself you will escape the judgment of god,the hand of the lord was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord,1
4876,ROM,2,NRSV,or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience,and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit,1
4877,ROM,2,NRSV,do you not realize that gods kindness is meant to lead you to repentance,he said all this quite openly,1
4878,ROM,2,NRSV,but by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when gods righteous judgment will be revealed,stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality,1
4879,ROM,2,NRSV,for he will repay according to each ones deeds to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life while for those who are selfseeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness there will be wrath and fury,do not even eat with such a one,1
4880,ROM,2,NRSV,there will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil the jew first and also the greek but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good the jew first and also the greek,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus,1
4881,ROM,2,NRSV,all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the futureall belong to you and you belong to christ and christ belongs to god,1
4882,ROM,2,NRSV,for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in gods sight but the doers of the law who will be justified,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,1
4883,ROM,2,NRSV,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves,how could you fail to perceive that i was not speaking about bread,1
4884,ROM,2,NRSV,they show that what the law requires is written on their hearts to which their own conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them on the day when according to my gospel god through jesus christ will judge the secret thoughts of all,but if that wicked slave says to himself my master is delayed and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know,1
4885,ROM,2,NRSV,but if you call yourself a jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to god and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness a corrector of the foolish a teacher of children having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth you then that teach others will you not teach yourself,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,1
4886,ROM,2,NRSV,while you preach against stealing do you steal,when he had finished speaking he knelt down with them all and prayed,1
4887,ROM,2,NRSV,you that forbid adultery do you commit adultery,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,1
4888,ROM,2,NRSV,you that abhor idols do you rob temples,wives in the same way accept the authority of your husbands so that even if some of them do not obey the word they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct when they see the purity and reverence of your lives,1
4889,ROM,2,NRSV,you that boast in the law do you dishonor god by breaking the law,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,1
4890,ROM,2,NRSV,for as it is written the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you,you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions,1
4891,ROM,2,NRSV,circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law but if you break the law your circumcision has become uncircumcision,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you,1
4892,ROM,2,NRSV,so if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews,1
4893,ROM,2,NRSV,then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law,and if you belong to christ then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to the promise,1
4894,ROM,2,NRSV,for a person is not a jew who is one outwardly nor is true circumcision something external and physical,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,1
4895,ROM,2,NRSV,rather a person is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heartit is spiritual and not literal,the lord is not slow about his promise as some think of slowness but is patient with you not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance,1
4896,ROM,2,NRSV,such a person receives praise not from others but from god,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given,1
4897,ROM,3,NRSV,then what advantage has the jew,peace be to the whole community and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ,1
4898,ROM,3,NRSV,or what is the value of circumcision,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead,1
4899,ROM,3,NRSV,for in the first place the jews were entrusted with the oracles of god,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction,1
4900,ROM,3,NRSV,will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of god,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid,1
4901,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means although everyone is a liar let god be proved true as it is written so that you may be justified in your words and prevail in your judging,and the twentyfour elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who is seated on the throne saying amen,1
4902,ROM,3,NRSV,but if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of god what should we say,and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one buys their cargo anymore cargo of gold silver jewels and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet all kinds of scented wood all articles of ivory all articles of costly wood bronze iron and marble cinnamon spice incense myrrh frankincense wine olive oil choice flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and chariots slavesand human lives,1
4903,ROM,3,NRSV,that god is unjust to inflict wrath on us,jesus said to him if you are ableall things can be done for the one who believes,1
4904,ROM,3,NRSV,i speak in a human way by no means for then how could god judge the world,children it is the last hour as you have heard that antichrist is coming so now many antichrists have come,1
4905,ROM,3,NRSV,but if through my falsehood gods truthfulness abounds to his glory why am i still being condemned as a sinner,and i will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below blood and fire and smoky mist,1
4906,ROM,3,NRSV,and why not say as some people slander us by saying that we say let us do evil so that good may come,then he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile,1
4907,ROM,3,NRSV,their condemnation is deserved what then,after his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of god,1
4908,ROM,3,NRSV,no not at all for we have already charged that all both jews and greeks are under the power of sin as it is written there is no one who is righteous not even one there is no one who has understanding there is no one who seeks god,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory,1
4909,ROM,3,NRSV,all have turned aside together they have become worthless there is no one who shows kindness there is not even one,and when jesus had been baptized just as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him,1
4910,ROM,3,NRSV,their throats are opened graves they use their tongues to deceive,then jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so also the fish as much as they wanted,1
4911,ROM,3,NRSV,the venom of vipers is under their lips,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like,1
4912,ROM,3,NRSV,their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness,the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life,1
4913,ROM,3,NRSV,their feet are swift to shed blood ruin and misery are in their paths and the way of peace they have not known,those who speak in a tongue build up themselves but those who prophesy build up the church,1
4914,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no fear of god before their eyes,i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end,1
4915,ROM,3,NRSV,now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to god,and how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him,1
4916,ROM,3,NRSV,for no human being will be justified in his sight by deeds prescribed by the law for through the law comes the knowledge of sin,todays trouble is enough for today,1
4917,ROM,3,NRSV,but now apart from law the righteousness of god has been disclosed and is attested by the law and the prophets the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like,1
4918,ROM,3,NRSV,for there is no distinction since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god they are now justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood effective through faith,yet she will be saved through childbearing provided they continue in faith and love and holiness with modesty,1
4919,ROM,3,NRSV,he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus,was it before or after he had been circumcised,1
4920,ROM,3,NRSV,no but by the law of faith,but the advocate the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you,1
4921,ROM,3,NRSV,for we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law,she was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs in the agony of giving birth,1
4922,ROM,3,NRSV,or is god the god of jews only,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin,1
4923,ROM,3,NRSV,is he not the god of gentiles also,now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him,1
4924,ROM,3,NRSV,yes of gentiles also since god is one and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith,now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love love one another deeply from the heart,1
4925,ROM,3,NRSV,do we then overthrow the law by this faith,gods love was revealed among us in this way god sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him,1
4926,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means on the contrary we uphold the law,and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good,1
4927,ROM,4,NRSV,what then are we to say was gained by abraham our ancestor according to the flesh,his wife was a descendant of aaron and her name was elizabeth,1
4928,ROM,4,NRSV,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god,for there is no distinction between jew and greek the same lord is lord of all and is generous to all who call on him,1
4929,ROM,4,NRSV,for what does the scripture say,now i desire to remind you though you are fully informed that the lord who once for all saved a people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe,1
4930,ROM,4,NRSV,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,then i fell down at his feet to worship him but he said to me you must not do that i am a fellow servant with you and your comrades who hold the testimony of jesus,1
4931,ROM,4,NRSV,now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due,his parents said this because they were afraid of the jews for the jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed jesus to be the messiah would be put out of the synagogue,1
4932,ROM,4,NRSV,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness,but the throne of god and of the lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads,1
4933,ROM,4,NRSV,so also david speaks of the blessedness of those to whom god reckons righteousness apart from works blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the one against whom the lord will not reckon sin,for this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news so that you may obtain the glory of our lord jesus christ,1
4934,ROM,4,NRSV,is this blessedness then pronounced only on the circumcised or also on the uncircumcised,and they were all together in solomons portico,1
4935,ROM,4,NRSV,we say faith was reckoned to abraham as righteousness,so do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is,1
4936,ROM,4,NRSV,how then was it reckoned to him,therefore whoever resists authority resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment,1
4937,ROM,4,NRSV,was it before or after he had been circumcised,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name,1
4938,ROM,4,NRSV,it was not after but before he was circumcised,so do not let your good be spoken of as evil,1
4939,ROM,4,NRSV,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery,1
4940,ROM,4,NRSV,the purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor abraham had before he was circumcised,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,1
4941,ROM,4,NRSV,for the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1
4942,ROM,4,NRSV,if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void,but god turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness o house of israel,1
4943,ROM,4,NRSV,for the law brings wrath but where there is no law neither is there violation,among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joseph and the mother of the sons of zebedee,1
4944,ROM,4,NRSV,for this reason it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of abraham for he is the father of all of us as it is written i have made you the father of many nationsin the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist,when he saw jesus he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god,1
4945,ROM,4,NRSV,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be,then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his messiah and he will reign forever and ever,1
4946,ROM,4,NRSV,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb,did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit,1
4947,ROM,4,NRSV,no distrust made him waver concerning the promise of god but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to god being fully convinced that god was able to do what he had promised,long ago god spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken to us by a son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom he also created the worlds,1
4948,ROM,4,NRSV,therefore his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness,truly i tell you no sign will be given to this generation,1
4949,ROM,4,NRSV,now the words it was reckoned to him were written not for his sake alone but for ours also,but i received mercy because i had acted ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in christ jesus,1
4950,ROM,4,NRSV,it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification,long ago god spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken to us by a son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom he also created the worlds,1
4951,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god,as they went from town to town they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem,1
4952,ROM,5,NRSV,and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us,but if there is no one to interpret let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to god,1
4953,ROM,5,NRSV,for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly,once when jesus was praying alone with only the disciples near him he asked them who do the crowds say that i am,1
4954,ROM,5,NRSV,indeed rarely will anyone die for a righteous personthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die,then he said to the disciple here is your mother,1
4955,ROM,5,NRSV,but god proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners christ died for us,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him,1
4956,ROM,5,NRSV,much more surely then now that we have been justified by his blood will we be saved through him from the wrath of god,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life,1
4957,ROM,5,NRSV,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life,for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves,1
4958,ROM,5,NRSV,but more than that we even boast in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation,therefore we ought to support such people so that we may become coworkers with the truth,1
4959,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and death came through sin and so death spread to all because all have sinned sin was indeed in the world before the law but sin is not reckoned when there is no law,they were afraid and amazed and said to one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him,1
4960,ROM,5,NRSV,yet death exercised dominion from adam to moses even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of adam who is a type of the one who was to come,his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow,1
4961,ROM,5,NRSV,but the free gift is not like the trespass,they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed paul,1
4962,ROM,5,NRSV,for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many,so he summoned him and said to him what is this that i hear about you,1
4963,ROM,5,NRSV,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1
4964,ROM,5,NRSV,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,for this reason the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he was not only breaking the sabbath but was also calling god his own father thereby making himself equal to god,1
4965,ROM,5,NRSV,if because of the one mans trespass death exercised dominion through that one much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man jesus christ,no one was able to give him an answer nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions,1
4966,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all,they were saying is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know,1
4967,ROM,5,NRSV,for just as by the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one mans obedience the many will be made righteous,to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity,1
4968,ROM,5,NRSV,but law came in with the result that the trespass multiplied but where sin increased grace abounded all the more so that just as sin exercised dominion in death so grace might also exercise dominion through justification leading to eternal life through jesus christ our lord,after he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word that jesus had spoken,1
4969,ROM,6,NRSV,what then are we to say,by faith moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth because they saw that the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the kings edict,1
4970,ROM,6,NRSV,should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound,they stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes then they suddenly confronted him seized him and brought him before the council,1
4971,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,and immediately they left their nets and followed him,1
4972,ROM,6,NRSV,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death,yet jesus did not say to him that he would not die but if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,1
4973,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life,and he said to him you have given the right answer do this and you will live,1
4974,ROM,6,NRSV,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his,that evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons,1
4975,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed and we might no longer be enslaved to sin,jesus answered if i have spoken wrongly testify to the wrong,1
4976,ROM,6,NRSV,for whoever has died is freed from sin,no one will snatch them out of my hand,1
4977,ROM,6,NRSV,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him,but if the unbelieving partner separates let it be so in such a case the brother or sister is not bound,1
4978,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him,do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you,1
4979,ROM,6,NRSV,the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god,then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her children those who keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus,1
4980,ROM,6,NRSV,so you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to god in christ jesus,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me,1
4981,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies to make you obey their passions,we have renounced the shameful things that one hides we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify gods word but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of god,1
4982,ROM,6,NRSV,no longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness but present yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and present your members to god as instruments of righteousness,again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,1
4983,ROM,6,NRSV,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace,i reprove and discipline those whom i love,1
4984,ROM,6,NRSV,should we sin because we are not under law but under grace,if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell,1
4985,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are,1
4986,ROM,6,NRSV,but thanks be to god that you having once been slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted and that you having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness,but felix who was rather well informed about the way adjourned the hearing with the comment when lysias the tribune comes down i will decide your case,1
4987,ROM,6,NRSV,i am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations,when the governor motioned to him to speak paul replied i cheerfully make my defense knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation,1
4988,ROM,6,NRSV,for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification,jesus said to him stand up take your mat and walk,1
4989,ROM,6,NRSV,when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness,with the spirit and power of elijah he will go before him to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the lord,1
4990,ROM,6,NRSV,so what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed,and a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him,1
4991,ROM,6,NRSV,the end of those things is death,since he was a prophet he knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne,1
4992,ROM,6,NRSV,but now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to god the advantage you get is sanctification,for though i am absent in body yet i am with you in spirit and i rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in christ,1
4993,ROM,6,NRSV,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,he has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty,1
4994,ROM,7,NRSV,do you not know brothers and sisters for i am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only during that persons lifetime,some of them were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a great many of the devout greeks and not a few of the leading women,1
4995,ROM,7,NRSV,thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband,while he was still speaking to the crowds his mother and his brothers were standing outside wanting to speak to him,1
4996,ROM,7,NRSV,accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,1
4997,ROM,7,NRSV,but if her husband dies she is free from that law and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress,jesus said to them the light is with you for a little longer,1
4998,ROM,7,NRSV,in the same way my friends you have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god,i also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to jesus and for the word of god,1
4999,ROM,7,NRSV,while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death,when he had seen the vision we immediately tried to cross over to macedonia being convinced that god had called us to proclaim the good news to them,1
5000,ROM,7,NRSV,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit,it was indeed written for our sake for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop,1
5001,ROM,7,NRSV,by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin,he did not know what to say for they were terrified,1
5002,ROM,7,NRSV,i would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet,they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to dieyet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them,1
5003,ROM,7,NRSV,but sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness,we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ,1
5004,ROM,7,NRSV,apart from the law sin lies dead,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison,1
5005,ROM,7,NRSV,i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me,so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out spoke to the woman who guarded the gate and brought peter in,1
5006,ROM,7,NRSV,for sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment deceived me and through it killed me,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified,1
5007,ROM,7,NRSV,so the law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good,so also when you see all these things you know that he is near at the very gates,1
5008,ROM,7,NRSV,did what is good then bring death to me,zechariah said to the angel how will i know that this is so,1
5009,ROM,7,NRSV,by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid,1
5010,ROM,7,NRSV,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold into slavery under sin,but when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow paul said to the centurion and the soldiers unless these men stay in the ship you cannot be saved,1
5011,ROM,7,NRSV,i do not understand my own actions,so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth,1
5012,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do what i want but i do the very thing i hate,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe,1
5013,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good,the earth shook and the rocks were split,1
5014,ROM,7,NRSV,but in fact it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me,you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess,1
5015,ROM,7,NRSV,for i know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh,certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law,1
5016,ROM,7,NRSV,i can will what is right but i cannot do it,whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this that god is true,1
5017,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do the good i want but the evil i do not want is what i do,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach,1
5018,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price,1
5019,ROM,7,NRSV,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,for to begin with when you come together as a church i hear that there are divisions among you and to some extent i believe it,1
5020,ROM,7,NRSV,for i delight in the law of god in my inmost self but i see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members,when the harvest time had come he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce,1
5021,ROM,7,NRSV,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death,jesus said to him you have seen him and the one speaking with you is he,1
5022,ROM,7,NRSV,thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then with my mind i am a slave to the law of god but with my flesh i am a slave to the law of sin,immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him and the tribune also was afraid for he realized that paul was a roman citizen and that he had bound him,1
5023,ROM,8,NRSV,there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus,he answered it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs,1
5024,ROM,8,NRSV,for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death,all who believed were together and had all things in common they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all as any had need,1
5025,ROM,8,NRSV,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin he condemned sin in the flesh so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit,but the lord is faithful he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one,1
5026,ROM,8,NRSV,for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit,get mark and bring him with you for he is useful in my ministry,1
5027,ROM,8,NRSV,to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,1
5028,ROM,8,NRSV,for this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods lawindeed it cannot and those who are in the flesh cannot please god,but if some of the branches were broken off and you a wild olive shoot were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree do not boast over the branches,1
5029,ROM,8,NRSV,but you are not in the flesh you are in the spirit since the spirit of god dwells in you,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name,1
5030,ROM,8,NRSV,anyone who does not have the spirit of christ does not belong to him,rather a person is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heartit is spiritual and not literal,1
5031,ROM,8,NRSV,but if christ is in you though the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness,you know the message he sent to the people of israel preaching peace by jesus christhe is lord of all,1
5032,ROM,8,NRSV,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit that dwells in you,and all of them ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full,1
5033,ROM,8,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live,tell her then to help me,1
5034,ROM,8,NRSV,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god,not that i am referring to being in need for i have learned to be content with whatever i have,1
5035,ROM,8,NRSV,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption,the second angel blew his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea,1
5036,ROM,8,NRSV,when we cry abba father it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right,1
5037,ROM,8,NRSV,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us,do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing rather let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is very precious in gods sight,1
5038,ROM,8,NRSV,for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god,gods love was revealed among us in this way god sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him,1
5039,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies,they bound him led him away and handed him over to pilate the governor,1
5040,ROM,8,NRSV,for in hope we were saved,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover,1
5041,ROM,8,NRSV,now hope that is seen is not hope,if those to whom the word of god came were called godsand the scripture cannot be annulled can you say that the one whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because i said i am gods son,1
5042,ROM,8,NRSV,for who hopes for what is seen,if you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters you will be a good servant of christ jesus nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed,1
5043,ROM,8,NRSV,but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience,he abolishes the first in order to establish the second,1
5044,ROM,8,NRSV,likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but that very spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb,1
5045,ROM,8,NRSV,and god who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god,the first said to him i have bought a piece of land and i must go out and see it please accept my regrets,1
5046,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that all things work together for good for those who love god who are called according to his purpose,when they heard him addressing them in hebrew they became even more quiet,1
5047,ROM,8,NRSV,for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord,1
5048,ROM,8,NRSV,and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,1
5049,ROM,8,NRSV,what then are we to say about these things,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money,1
5050,ROM,8,NRSV,if god is for us who is against us,he went away again across the jordan to the place where john had been baptizing earlier and he remained there,1
5051,ROM,8,NRSV,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit,1
5052,ROM,8,NRSV,who will bring any charge against gods elect,immediately they regained their sight and followed him,1
5053,ROM,8,NRSV,it is christ jesus who died yes who was raised who is at the right hand of god who indeed intercedes for us,so you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors for they killed them and you build their tombs,1
5054,ROM,8,NRSV,who will separate us from the love of christ,it so happened that the father of publius lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery,1
5055,ROM,8,NRSV,will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,when it comes it finds it swept and put in order,1
5056,ROM,8,NRSV,as it is written for your sake we are being killed all day long we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves,1
5057,ROM,8,NRSV,no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us,and all of them were amazed,1
5058,ROM,8,NRSV,for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head,1
5059,ROM,9,NRSV,i am speaking the truth in christi am not lying my conscience confirms it by the holy spirit i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart,when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together peter sat among them,1
5060,ROM,9,NRSV,for i could wish that i myself were accursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my own people my kindred according to the flesh,from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain,1
5061,ROM,9,NRSV,they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah who is over all god blessed forever,for just as woman came from man so man comes through woman but all things come from god,1
5062,ROM,9,NRSV,it is not as though the word of god had failed,and the angel said to me write this blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb,1
5063,ROM,9,NRSV,for not all israelites truly belong to israel and not all of abrahams children are his true descendants but it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,1
5064,ROM,9,NRSV,this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of god but the children of the promise are counted as descendants,jesus answered those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance,1
5065,ROM,9,NRSV,for this is what the promise said about this time i will return and sarah shall have a son,thus he has given us through these things his precious and very great promises so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become participants of the divine nature,1
5066,ROM,9,NRSV,nor is that all something similar happened to rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband our ancestor isaac,see what love the father has given us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are,1
5067,ROM,9,NRSV,even before they had been born or had done anything good or bad so that gods purpose of election might continue not by works but by his call she was told the elder shall serve the younger,now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of services but the same lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone,1
5068,ROM,9,NRSV,as it is written i have loved jacob but i have hated esau,john said to him teacher we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he was not following us,1
5069,ROM,9,NRSV,what then are we to say,whatever town or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave,1
5070,ROM,9,NRSV,is there injustice on gods part,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son,1
5071,ROM,9,NRSV,by no means for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion,to those outside the law i became as one outside the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so that i might win those outside the law,1
5072,ROM,9,NRSV,so it depends not on human will or exertion but on god who shows mercy,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first,1
5073,ROM,9,NRSV,for the scripture says to pharaoh i have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth,so when i have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected i will set out by way of you to spain and i know that when i come to you i will come in the fullness of the blessing of christ,1
5074,ROM,9,NRSV,so then he has mercy on whomever he chooses and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses,there we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days,1
5075,ROM,9,NRSV,you will say to me then why then does he still find fault,i am a debtor both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish hence my eagerness to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in rome,1
5076,ROM,9,NRSV,for who can resist his will,so it is with the resurrection of the dead,1
5077,ROM,9,NRSV,but who indeed are you a human being to argue with god,we have in fact found this man a pestilent fellow an agitator among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes,1
5078,ROM,9,NRSV,will what is molded say to the one who molds it why have you made me like this,pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers,1
5079,ROM,9,NRSV,has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use,bring me a denarius and let me see it,1
5080,ROM,9,NRSV,what if god desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy which he has prepared beforehand for glory including us whom he has called not from the jews only but also from the gentiles,those who do not believe in god have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that god has given concerning his son,1
5081,ROM,9,NRSV,as indeed he says in hosea those who were not my people i will call my people and her who was not beloved i will call beloved,and he said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,1
5082,ROM,9,NRSV,and in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people there they shall be called children of the living god,clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch as you really are unleavened,1
5083,ROM,9,NRSV,and isaiah cries out concerning israel though the number of the children of israel were like the sand of the sea only a remnant of them will be saved for the lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively,greet those in the lord who belong to the family of narcissus,1
5084,ROM,9,NRSV,and as isaiah predicted if the lord of hosts had not left survivors to us we would have fared like sodom and been made like gomorrah,now you have observed my teaching my conduct my aim in life my faith my patience my love my steadfastness my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in antioch iconium and lystra,1
5085,ROM,9,NRSV,what then are we to say,we ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain,1
5086,ROM,9,NRSV,gentiles who did not strive for righteousness have attained it that is righteousness through faith but israel who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law did not succeed in fulfilling that law,this punishment by the majority is enough for such a person so now instead you should forgive and console him so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow,1
5087,ROM,9,NRSV,because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith but as if it were based on works,and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon,1
5088,ROM,9,NRSV,they have stumbled over the stumbling stone as it is written see i am laying in zion a stone that will make people stumble a rock that will make them fall and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame,now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the night in prayer to god,1
5089,ROM,10,NRSV,brothers and sisters my hearts desire and prayer to god for them is that they may be saved,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,1
5090,ROM,10,NRSV,i can testify that they have a zeal for god but it is not enlightened,but he said to them you give them something to eat,1
5091,ROM,10,NRSV,for being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from god and seeking to establish their own they have not submitted to gods righteousness,first of all you must understand this that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and indulging their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming,1
5092,ROM,10,NRSV,for christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes,while he was speaking a pharisee invited him to dine with him so he went in and took his place at the table,1
5093,ROM,10,NRSV,moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law that the person who does these things will live by them,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was eager to do,1
5094,ROM,10,NRSV,but the righteousness that comes from faith says do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven,then the one who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more talents saying master you handed over to me five talents see i have made five more talents,1
5095,ROM,10,NRSV,that is to bring christ down or who will descend into the abyss,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,1
5096,ROM,10,NRSV,that is to bring christ up from the dead,i am the vine you are the branches,1
5097,ROM,10,NRSV,the word is near you on your lips and in your heart that is the word of faith that we proclaim because if you confess with your lips that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved,who can forgive sins but god alone,1
5098,ROM,10,NRSV,for one believes with the heart and so is justified and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved,he found philip and said to him follow me,1
5099,ROM,10,NRSV,the scripture says no one who believes in him will be put to shame,so also our beloved brother paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him speaking of this as he does in all his letters,1
5100,ROM,10,NRSV,for there is no distinction between jew and greek the same lord is lord of all and is generous to all who call on him,make every effort to send zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way and see that they lack nothing,1
5101,ROM,10,NRSV,for everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute,1
5102,ROM,10,NRSV,but how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were amazed and recognized them as companions of jesus,1
5103,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband is the head of his wife and god is the head of christ,1
5104,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him,a third of the sea became blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed,1
5105,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor,1
5106,ROM,10,NRSV,as it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news but not all have obeyed the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message,from noon on darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,1
5107,ROM,10,NRSV,so faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes through the word of christ,for this reason the father loves me because i lay down my life in order to take it up again,1
5108,ROM,10,NRSV,but i ask have they not heard,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years and though she had spent all she had on physicians no one could cure her,1
5109,ROM,10,NRSV,indeed they have for their voice has gone out to all the earth and their words to the ends of the world,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,1
5110,ROM,10,NRSV,again i ask did israel not understand,david himself calls him lord so how can he be his son,1
5111,ROM,10,NRSV,first moses says i will make you jealous of those who are not a nation with a foolish nation i will make you angry,anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge but anyone who loves god is known by him,1
5112,ROM,10,NRSV,then isaiah is so bold as to say i have been found by those who did not seek me i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me,he looked around at them with anger he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man stretch out your hand,1
5113,ROM,10,NRSV,but of israel he says all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people,he was destined before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake,1
5114,ROM,11,NRSV,i ask then has god rejected his people,do not lag in zeal be ardent in spirit serve the lord,1
5115,ROM,11,NRSV,by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin,there he found a man named aeneas who had been bedridden for eight years for he was paralyzed,1
5116,ROM,11,NRSV,god has not rejected his people whom he foreknew,and he will send them immediately,1
5117,ROM,11,NRSV,do you not know what the scripture says of elijah how he pleads with god against israel,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,1
5118,ROM,11,NRSV,lord they have killed your prophets they have demolished your altars i alone am left and they are seeking my life,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray,1
5119,ROM,11,NRSV,but what is the divine reply to him,i can will what is right but i cannot do it,1
5120,ROM,11,NRSV,i have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,1
5121,ROM,11,NRSV,so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace,salt is good but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored,1
5122,ROM,11,NRSV,but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign,1
5123,ROM,11,NRSV,israel failed to obtain what it was seeking,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me,1
5124,ROM,11,NRSV,the elect obtained it but the rest were hardened as it is written god gave them a sluggish spirit eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear down to this very day,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for,1
5125,ROM,11,NRSV,and david says let their table become a snare and a trap a stumbling block and a retribution for them let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see and keep their backs forever bent,what then did you go out to see,1
5126,ROM,11,NRSV,so i ask have they stumbled so as to fall,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region,1
5127,ROM,11,NRSV,by no means but through their stumbling salvation has come to the gentiles so as to make israel jealous,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem,1
5128,ROM,11,NRSV,now if their stumbling means riches for the world and if their defeat means riches for gentiles how much more will their full inclusion mean now i am speaking to you gentiles,every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god,1
5129,ROM,11,NRSV,inasmuch then as i am an apostle to the gentiles i glorify my ministry in order to make my own people jealous and thus save some of them,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine,1
5130,ROM,11,NRSV,for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead if the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy then the whole batch is holy and if the root is holy then the branches also are holy,have you come to destroy us,1
5131,ROM,11,NRSV,but if some of the branches were broken off and you a wild olive shoot were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree do not boast over the branches,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,1
5132,ROM,11,NRSV,if you do boast remember that it is not you that support the root but the root that supports you,then he went home and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat,1
5133,ROM,11,NRSV,you will say branches were broken off so that i might be grafted in,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
5134,ROM,11,NRSV,they were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand only through faith,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god,1
5135,ROM,11,NRSV,so do not become proud but stand in awe,then i saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth,1
5136,ROM,11,NRSV,for if god did not spare the natural branches perhaps he will not spare you,then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor david hosanna in the highest heaven then he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve,1
5137,ROM,11,NRSV,note then the kindness and the severity of god severity toward those who have fallen but gods kindness toward you provided you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off,i do not give to you as the world gives,1
5138,ROM,11,NRSV,and even those of israel if they do not persist in unbelief will be grafted in for god has the power to graft them in again,we destroy arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of god and we take every thought captive to obey christ,1
5139,ROM,11,NRSV,for if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped,1
5140,ROM,11,NRSV,so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters i want you to understand this mystery a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of the gentiles has come in,when he had entered he said to them why do you make a commotion and weep,1
5141,ROM,11,NRSV,and so all israel will be saved as it is written out of zion will come the deliverer he will banish ungodliness from jacob,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be,1
5142,ROM,11,NRSV,and this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins,formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me,1
5143,ROM,11,NRSV,as regards the gospel they are enemies of god for your sake but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their ancestors for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable,with all of these take the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one,1
5144,ROM,11,NRSV,just as you were once disobedient to god but have now received mercy because of their disobedience so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they too may now receive mercy,when he heard this he was shocked and went away grieving for he had many possessions,1
5145,ROM,11,NRSV,for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all,then peter remembered and said to him rabbi look the fig tree that you cursed has withered,1
5146,ROM,11,NRSV,o the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways for who has known the mind of the lord,someone from the crowd answered him teacher i brought you my son he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak and whenever it seizes him it dashes him down and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid and i asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do so,1
5147,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has been his counselor,when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas also the books and above all the parchments,1
5148,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has given a gift to him to receive a gift in return,from this we know that it is the last hour,1
5149,ROM,11,NRSV,for from him and through him and to him are all things,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village,1
5150,ROM,11,NRSV,to him be the glory forever,from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute,1
5151,ROM,12,NRSV,i appeal to you therefore brothers and sisters by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual worship,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,1
5152,ROM,12,NRSV,do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of godwhat is good and acceptable and perfect,this continued for two years so that all the residents of asia both jews and greeks heard the word of the lord,1
5153,ROM,12,NRSV,for by the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has assigned,he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy,1
5154,ROM,12,NRSV,for as in one body we have many members and not all the members have the same function so we who are many are one body in christ and individually we are members one of another,in him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for god,1
5155,ROM,12,NRSV,we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness,figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush,1
5156,ROM,12,NRSV,let love be genuine hate what is evil hold fast to what is good love one another with mutual affection outdo one another in showing honor,and why do you not judge for yourselves what is right,1
5157,ROM,12,NRSV,do not lag in zeal be ardent in spirit serve the lord,then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,1
5158,ROM,12,NRSV,rejoice in hope be patient in suffering persevere in prayer,truly i tell you i will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god,1
5159,ROM,12,NRSV,contribute to the needs of the saints extend hospitality to strangers,he also said to the crowds when you see a cloud rising in the west you immediately say it is going to rain and so it happens,1
5160,ROM,12,NRSV,bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse them,do you have eyes and fail to see,1
5161,ROM,12,NRSV,rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep,since i am convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith so that i may share abundantly in your boasting in christ jesus when i come to you again,1
5162,ROM,12,NRSV,live in harmony with one another do not be haughty but associate with the lowly do not claim to be wiser than you are,this was not because we do not have that right but in order to give you an example to imitate,1
5163,ROM,12,NRSV,do not repay anyone evil for evil but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all,jesus said to him you have seen him and the one speaking with you is he,1
5164,ROM,12,NRSV,if it is possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with all,ask those who heard what i said to them they know what i said,1
5165,ROM,12,NRSV,beloved never avenge yourselves but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord,it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce,1
5166,ROM,12,NRSV,no if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads,then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first,1
5167,ROM,12,NRSV,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,of these things we cannot speak now in detail,1
5168,ROM,13,NRSV,let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those authorities that exist have been instituted by god,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder,1
5169,ROM,13,NRSV,therefore whoever resists authority resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well,1
5170,ROM,13,NRSV,for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad,as you therefore have received christ jesus the lord continue to live your lives in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith just as you were taught abounding in thanksgiving,1
5171,ROM,13,NRSV,do you wish to have no fear of the authority,the second angel poured his bowl into the sea and it became like the blood of a corpse and every living thing in the sea died,1
5172,ROM,13,NRSV,then do what is good and you will receive its approval for it is gods servant for your good,for this reason since the day we heard it we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of gods will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding so that you may lead lives worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of god,1
5173,ROM,13,NRSV,but if you do what is wrong you should be afraid for the authority does not bear the sword in vain it is the servant of god to execute wrath on the wrongdoer,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,1
5174,ROM,13,NRSV,therefore one must be subject not only because of wrath but also because of conscience,again he began to teach beside the sea,1
5175,ROM,13,NRSV,for the same reason you also pay taxes for the authorities are gods servants busy with this very thing,he also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables,1
5176,ROM,13,NRSV,pay to all what is due themtaxes to whom taxes are due revenue to whom revenue is due respect to whom respect is due honor to whom honor is due,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away,1
5177,ROM,13,NRSV,owe no one anything except to love one another for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law,when a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him he said in a parable a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell on the path and was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up,1
5178,ROM,13,NRSV,the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word love your neighbor as yourself,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,1
5179,ROM,13,NRSV,love does no wrong to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law,a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,1
5180,ROM,13,NRSV,besides this you know what time it is how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep,this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all,1
5181,ROM,13,NRSV,for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers the night is far gone the day is near,i stand in the presence of god and i have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news,1
5182,ROM,13,NRSV,let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light let us live honorably as in the day not in reveling and drunkenness not in debauchery and licentiousness not in quarreling and jealousy,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth,1
5183,ROM,13,NRSV,instead put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires,now they had been sent from the pharisees,1
5184,ROM,14,NRSV,welcome those who are weak in faith but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions,but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her,1
5185,ROM,14,NRSV,some believe in eating anything while the weak eat only vegetables,peter answered him you are the messiah,1
5186,ROM,14,NRSV,those who eat must not despise those who abstain and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat for god has welcomed them,all things are lawful for me but i will not be dominated by anything,1
5187,ROM,14,NRSV,who are you to pass judgment on servants of another,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints,1
5188,ROM,14,NRSV,it is before their own lord that they stand or fall,one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him,1
5189,ROM,14,NRSV,and they will be upheld for the lord is able to make them stand,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,1
5190,ROM,14,NRSV,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,1
5191,ROM,14,NRSV,let all be fully convinced in their own minds,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire,1
5192,ROM,14,NRSV,those who observe the day observe it in honor of the lord,take care that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you in heaven their angels continually see the face of my father in heaven,1
5193,ROM,14,NRSV,also those who eat eat in honor of the lord since they give thanks to god while those who abstain abstain in honor of the lord and give thanks to god,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons,1
5194,ROM,14,NRSV,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,1
5195,ROM,14,NRSV,if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords,while peter was kept in prison the church prayed fervently to god for him,1
5196,ROM,14,NRSV,for to this end christ died and lived again so that he might be lord of both the dead and the living,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way,1
5197,ROM,14,NRSV,why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt,1
5198,ROM,14,NRSV,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,and he said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,1
5199,ROM,14,NRSV,for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god,for herod had arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because john had been telling him it is not lawful for you to have her,1
5200,ROM,14,NRSV,for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god,then jesus said to him put your sword back into its place for all who take the sword will perish by the sword,1
5201,ROM,14,NRSV,so then each of us will be accountable to god,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1
5202,ROM,14,NRSV,let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another but resolve instead never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of another,for one believes with the heart and so is justified and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved,1
5203,ROM,14,NRSV,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god,1
5204,ROM,14,NRSV,if your brother or sister is being injured by what you eat you are no longer walking in love,you will be enriched in every way for your great generosity which will produce thanksgiving to god through us for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to god,1
5205,ROM,14,NRSV,do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom christ died,but if someone stands firm in his resolve being under no necessity but having his own desire under control and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee he will do well,1
5206,ROM,14,NRSV,so do not let your good be spoken of as evil,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin,1
5207,ROM,14,NRSV,for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit,then jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal,1
5208,ROM,14,NRSV,the one who thus serves christ is acceptable to god and has human approval,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,1
5209,ROM,14,NRSV,let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding,but gods firm foundation stands bearing this inscription the lord knows those who are his and let everyone who calls on the name of the lord turn away from wickedness,1
5210,ROM,14,NRSV,do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god,the high priest stood up and said have you no answer,1
5211,ROM,14,NRSV,everything is indeed clean but it is wrong for you to make others fall by what you eat it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother or sister stumble,and when he had stepped out of the boat immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him,1
5212,ROM,14,NRSV,the faith that you have have as your own conviction before god,so also when you see these things taking place you know that the kingdom of god is near,1
5213,ROM,14,NRSV,blessed are those who have no reason to condemn themselves because of what they approve,do not be astonished brothers and sisters that the world hates you,1
5214,ROM,14,NRSV,but those who have doubts are condemned if they eat because they do not act from faith for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts,1
5215,ROM,15,NRSV,we who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves,where do you get that living water,1
5216,ROM,15,NRSV,each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor,i will send my beloved son perhaps they will respect him,1
5217,ROM,15,NRSV,for christ did not please himself but as it is written the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me,the third woe is coming very soon,1
5218,ROM,15,NRSV,for whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope,when he was sitting on the mount of olives opposite the temple peter james john and andrew asked him privately tell us when will this be and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished,1
5219,ROM,15,NRSV,may the god of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another in accordance with christ jesus so that together you may with one voice glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ,the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john who testified to the word of god and to the testimony of jesus christ even to all that he saw,1
5220,ROM,15,NRSV,welcome one another therefore just as christ has welcomed you for the glory of god,if therefore demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them bring charges there against one another,1
5221,ROM,15,NRSV,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god,1
5222,ROM,15,NRSV,as it is written therefore i will confess you among the gentiles and sing praises to your name and again he says rejoice o gentiles with his people and again praise the lord all you gentiles and let all the peoples praise him and again isaiah says the root of jesse shall come the one who rises to rule the gentiles in him the gentiles shall hope,jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me,1
5223,ROM,15,NRSV,may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy spirit,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money,1
5224,ROM,15,NRSV,i myself feel confident about you my brothers and sisters that you yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another,and i will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days wearing sackcloth,1
5225,ROM,15,NRSV,nevertheless on some points i have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder because of the grace given me by god to be a minister of christ jesus to the gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of god so that the offering of the gentiles may be acceptable sanctified by the holy spirit,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,1
5226,ROM,15,NRSV,in christ jesus then i have reason to boast of my work for god,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction,1
5227,ROM,15,NRSV,for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the gentiles by word and deed by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and as far around as illyricum i have fully proclaimed the good news of christ,jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing what abraham did but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god,1
5228,ROM,15,NRSV,thus i make it my ambition to proclaim the good news not where christ has already been named so that i do not build on someone elses foundation but as it is written those who have never been told of him shall see and those who have never heard of him shall understand,the first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is from heaven,1
5229,ROM,15,NRSV,this is the reason that i have so often been hindered from coming to you,for many gave false testimony against him and their testimony did not agree,1
5230,ROM,15,NRSV,but now with no further place for me in these regions i desire as i have for many years to come to you when i go to spain,but we have the mind of christ,1
5231,ROM,15,NRSV,for i do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you once i have enjoyed your company for a little while,they went on from there and passed through galilee,1
5232,ROM,15,NRSV,at present however i am going to jerusalem in a ministry to the saints for macedonia and achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at jerusalem,and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus,1
5233,ROM,15,NRSV,they were pleased to do this and indeed they owe it to them for if the gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings they ought also to be of service to them in material things,but more than that we even boast in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation,1
5234,ROM,15,NRSV,so when i have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected i will set out by way of you to spain and i know that when i come to you i will come in the fullness of the blessing of christ,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,1
5235,ROM,15,NRSV,i appeal to you brothers and sisters by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit to join me in earnest prayer to god on my behalf that i may be rescued from the unbelievers in judea and that my ministry to jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints so that by gods will i may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord,1
5236,ROM,15,NRSV,the god of peace be with all of you,he said where have you laid him,1
5237,ROM,16,NRSV,i commend to you our sister phoebe a deacon of the church at cenchreae so that you may welcome her in the lord as is fitting for the saints and help her in whatever she may require from you for she has been a benefactor of many and of myself as well,then he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man and you will not see it,1
5238,ROM,16,NRSV,greet prisca and aquila who work with me in christ jesus and who risked their necks for my life to whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles,and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit,1
5239,ROM,16,NRSV,greet also the church in their house,and i will show you a still more excellent way,1
5240,ROM,16,NRSV,greet my beloved epaenetus who was the first convert in asia for christ,so when peter went up to jerusalem the circumcised believers criticized him saying why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them,1
5241,ROM,16,NRSV,greet mary who has worked very hard among you,now there were seven brothers among us the first married and died childless leaving the widow to his brother,1
5242,ROM,16,NRSV,greet andronicus and junia my relatives who were in prison with me they are prominent among the apostles and they were in christ before i was,festus replied that paul was being kept at caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly,1
5243,ROM,16,NRSV,greet ampliatus my beloved in the lord,examine yourselves and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup,1
5244,ROM,16,NRSV,greet urbanus our coworker in christ and my beloved stachys,he it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds,1
5245,ROM,16,NRSV,greet apelles who is approved in christ,aquila and prisca together with the church in their house greet you warmly in the lord,1
5246,ROM,16,NRSV,greet those who belong to the family of aristobulus,drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman,1
5247,ROM,16,NRSV,greet those in the lord who belong to the family of narcissus,when he heard that jesus had come from judea to galilee he went and begged him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,1
5248,ROM,16,NRSV,greet those workers in the lord tryphaena and tryphosa,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit,1
5249,ROM,16,NRSV,greet the beloved persis who has worked hard in the lord,and in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people there they shall be called children of the living god,1
5250,ROM,16,NRSV,greet rufus chosen in the lord and greet his mothera mother to me also,when he went out about nine oclock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and he said to them you also go into the vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right,1
5251,ROM,16,NRSV,greet asyncritus phlegon hermes patrobas hermas and the brothers and sisters who are with them,but the angel said to me why are you so amazed,1
5252,ROM,16,NRSV,greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them,that same day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea,1
5253,ROM,16,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss,last of all the woman herself died,1
5254,ROM,16,NRSV,all the churches of christ greet you,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me has not been in vain,1
5255,ROM,16,NRSV,i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them,for it was attested before he was taken away that he had pleased god,1
5256,ROM,16,NRSV,for such people do not serve our lord christ but their own appetites and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the simpleminded,and he was amazed at their unbelief,1
5257,ROM,16,NRSV,for while your obedience is known to all so that i rejoice over you i want you to be wise in what is good and guileless in what is evil,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything,1
5258,ROM,16,NRSV,the god of peace will shortly crush satan under your feet,so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing tychicus will tell you everything,1
5259,ROM,16,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you,and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning,1
5260,ROM,16,NRSV,timothy my coworker greets you so do lucius and jason and sosipater my relatives,you are witnesses of these things,1
5261,ROM,16,NRSV,i tertius the writer of this letter greet you in the lord,so then each of us will be accountable to god,1
5262,ROM,16,NRSV,gaius who is host to me and to the whole church greets you,all who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves will be exalted,1
5263,ROM,16,NRSV,erastus the city treasurer and our brother quartus greet you,after this paul left athens and went to corinth,1
5264,ROM,16,NRSV,now to god who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages but is now disclosed and through the prophetic writings is made known to all the gentiles according to the command of the eternal god to bring about the obedience of faith to the only wise god through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever amen,but the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart a good conscience and sincere faith,1
5265,1CO,1,NRSV,paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and our brother sosthenes to the church of god that is in corinth to those who are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our lord jesus christ both their lord and ours grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,the jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,1
5266,1CO,1,NRSV,i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind just as the testimony of christ has been strengthened among you so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ,but jesus answered them my father is still working and i also am working,1
5267,1CO,1,NRSV,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing,1
5268,1CO,1,NRSV,god is faithful by him you were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord,he replied what is impossible for mortals is possible for god,1
5269,1CO,1,NRSV,now i appeal to you brothers and sisters by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose,how much longer must i put up with you,1
5270,1CO,1,NRSV,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters,and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people that is from their kindred though these also are descended from abraham,1
5271,1CO,1,NRSV,what i mean is that each of you says i belong to paul or i belong to apollos or i belong to cephas or i belong to christ,how can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is god,1
5272,1CO,1,NRSV,or were you baptized in the name of paul,he left that place and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him,1
5273,1CO,1,NRSV,i thank god that i baptized none of you except crispus and gaius so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name,for we are in danger of being charged with rioting today since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion,1
5274,1CO,1,NRSV,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power,he is the reflection of gods glory and the exact imprint of gods very being and he sustains all things by his powerful word,1
5275,1CO,1,NRSV,for the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god,if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your mind,1
5276,1CO,1,NRSV,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart,when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices,1
5277,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the one who is wise,from them i also received letters to the brothers in damascus and i went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to jerusalem for punishment,1
5278,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the debater of this age,and in his name the gentiles will hope,1
5279,1CO,1,NRSV,has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world,you cannot serve god and wealth,1
5280,1CO,1,NRSV,for since in the wisdom of god the world did not know god through wisdom god decided through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe,jesus went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people,1
5281,1CO,1,NRSV,for jews demand signs and greeks desire wisdom but we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles but to those who are the called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter,1
5282,1CO,1,NRSV,for gods foolishness is wiser than human wisdom and gods weakness is stronger than human strength,they said lord look here are two swords,1
5283,1CO,1,NRSV,consider your own call brothers and sisters not many of you were wise by human standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus was not yet glorified,1
5284,1CO,1,NRSV,but god chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise god chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong god chose what is low and despised in the world things that are not to reduce to nothing things that are so that no one might boast in the presence of god,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound had been healed,1
5285,1CO,1,NRSV,he is the source of your life in christ jesus who became for us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption in order that as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lord,they cried out in a loud voice saying salvation belongs to our god who is seated on the throne and to the lamb and all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped god singing amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our god forever and ever amen,1
5286,1CO,2,NRSV,when i came to you brothers and sisters i did not come proclaiming the mystery of god to you in lofty words or wisdom,then one of the elders addressed me saying who are these robed in white and where have they come from,1
5287,1CO,2,NRSV,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified,he brought them up into the house and set food before them and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in god,1
5288,1CO,2,NRSV,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,and to what should i compare it,1
5289,1CO,2,NRSV,my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of god,a leper came to him begging him and kneeling he said to him if you choose you can make me clean,1
5290,1CO,2,NRSV,yet among the mature we do speak wisdom though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are doomed to perish,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb,1
5291,1CO,2,NRSV,but we speak gods wisdom secret and hidden which god decreed before the ages for our glory,he is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at mount sinai and with our ancestors and he received living oracles to give to us,1
5292,1CO,2,NRSV,none of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory,three times i was beaten with rods,1
5293,1CO,2,NRSV,but as it is written what no eye has seen nor ear heard nor the human heart conceived what god has prepared for those who love him these things god has revealed to us through the spirit for the spirit searches everything even the depths of god,let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent we will also do when present,1
5294,1CO,2,NRSV,for what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within,in damascus the governor under king aretas guarded the city of damascus in order to seize me but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands,1
5295,1CO,2,NRSV,so also no one comprehends what is truly gods except the spirit of god,rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep,1
5296,1CO,2,NRSV,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is from god so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by god,love has been perfected among us in this that we may have boldness on the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world,1
5297,1CO,2,NRSV,and we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the spirit interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual,you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone,1
5298,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of gods spirit for they are foolishness to them and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned,i have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you my brother,1
5299,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are spiritual discern all things and they are themselves subject to no one elses scrutiny,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast,1
5300,1CO,2,NRSV,for who has known the mind of the lord so as to instruct him,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1
5301,1CO,2,NRSV,but we have the mind of christ,very truly i tell you when you were younger you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished,1
5302,1CO,3,NRSV,and so brothers and sisters i could not speak to you as spiritual people but rather as people of the flesh as infants in christ,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you,1
5303,1CO,3,NRSV,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food,but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and cried out for they all saw him and were terrified,1
5304,1CO,3,NRSV,even now you are still not ready for you are still of the flesh,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh,1
5305,1CO,3,NRSV,for as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not of the flesh and behaving according to human inclinations,how can you say show us the father,1
5306,1CO,3,NRSV,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human,then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back sealed with seven seals and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals,1
5307,1CO,3,NRSV,servants through whom you came to believe as the lord assigned to each,so deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own selves because you have become very dear to us,1
5308,1CO,3,NRSV,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth,guard the good treasure entrusted to you with the help of the holy spirit living in us,1
5309,1CO,3,NRSV,so neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything but only god who gives the growth,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet,1
5310,1CO,3,NRSV,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each,for this we declare to you by the word of the lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the lord will by no means precede those who have died,1
5311,1CO,3,NRSV,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman,1
5312,1CO,3,NRSV,according to the grace of god given to me like a skilled master builder i laid a foundation and someone else is building on it,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery,1
5313,1CO,3,NRSV,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,then jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham,1
5314,1CO,3,NRSV,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,the sadducees say that there is no resurrection or angel or spirit but the pharisees acknowledge all three then a great clamor arose and certain scribes of the pharisees group stood up and contended we find nothing wrong with this man,1
5315,1CO,3,NRSV,now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw the work of each builder will become visible for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test what sort of work each has done,then he asked them you see all these do you not,1
5316,1CO,3,NRSV,if what has been built on the foundation survives the builder will receive a reward,neither has herod for he sent him back to us,1
5317,1CO,3,NRSV,if the work is burned up the builder will suffer loss the builder will be saved but only as through fire,then he led them out as far as bethany and lifting up his hands he blessed them,1
5318,1CO,3,NRSV,do you not know that you are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells in you,now there was an ethiopian eunuch a court official of the candace queen of the ethiopians in charge of her entire treasury,1
5319,1CO,3,NRSV,if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person,i have sent tychicus to ephesus,1
5320,1CO,3,NRSV,for gods temple is holy and you are that temple,and the pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying this fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them,1
5321,1CO,3,NRSV,if you think that you are wise in this age you should become fools so that you may become wise,so if you think you are standing watch out that you do not fall,1
5322,1CO,3,NRSV,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god,he came to us and took pauls belt bound his own feet and hands with it and said thus says the holy spirit this is the way the jews in jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles,1
5323,1CO,3,NRSV,for it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile,for gods temple is holy and you are that temple,1
5324,1CO,3,NRSV,so let no one boast about human leaders,holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one,1
5325,1CO,3,NRSV,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the futureall belong to you and you belong to christ and christ belongs to god,and the one with the two talents also came forward saying master you handed over to me two talents see i have made two more talents,1
5326,1CO,4,NRSV,think of us in this way as servants of christ and stewards of gods mysteries,as jesus came out of the temple and was going away his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple,1
5327,1CO,4,NRSV,moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy,he began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone,1
5328,1CO,4,NRSV,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court,jesus said take away the stone,1
5329,1CO,4,NRSV,i do not even judge myself,since he wanted to find out what paul was being accused of by the jews the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet,1
5330,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not aware of anything against myself but i am not thereby acquitted,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later,1
5331,1CO,4,NRSV,it is the lord who judges me,now by this we may be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments,1
5332,1CO,4,NRSV,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart,then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray,1
5333,1CO,4,NRSV,then each one will receive commendation from god,jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to those who are called who are beloved in god the father and kept safe for jesus christ may mercy peace and love be yours in abundance,1
5334,1CO,4,NRSV,i have applied all this to apollos and myself for your benefit brothers and sisters so that you may learn through us the meaning of the saying nothing beyond what is written so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another,besides that they learn to be idle gadding about from house to house and they are not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say,1
5335,1CO,4,NRSV,for who sees anything different in you,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit,1
5336,1CO,4,NRSV,what do you have that you did not receive,when the young man heard this word he went away grieving for he had many possessions,1
5337,1CO,4,NRSV,and if you received it why do you boast as if it were not a gift,how does gods love abide in anyone who has the worlds goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help,1
5338,1CO,4,NRSV,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near,1
5339,1CO,4,NRSV,we are fools for the sake of christ but you are wise in christ,and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband,1
5340,1CO,4,NRSV,we are weak but you are strong,the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with all of you,1
5341,1CO,4,NRSV,you are held in honor but we in disrepute,the dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven,1
5342,1CO,4,NRSV,to the present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless and we grow weary from the work of our own hands,i will write on you the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem that comes down from my god out of heaven and my own new name,1
5343,1CO,4,NRSV,when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure when slandered we speak kindly,blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled,1
5344,1CO,4,NRSV,we have become like the rubbish of the world the dregs of all things to this very day,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,1
5345,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not writing this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly,1
5346,1CO,4,NRSV,for though you might have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers,so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters i want you to understand this mystery a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of the gentiles has come in,1
5347,1CO,4,NRSV,indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel,and i lay down my life for the sheep,1
5348,1CO,4,NRSV,i appeal to you then be imitators of me,after two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and since he wanted to grant the jews a favor felix left paul in prison,1
5349,1CO,4,NRSV,for this reason i sent you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath,1
5350,1CO,4,NRSV,but some of you thinking that i am not coming to you have become arrogant,you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment,1
5351,1CO,4,NRSV,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name,1
5352,1CO,4,NRSV,for the kingdom of god depends not on talk but on power,i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love,1
5353,1CO,4,NRSV,am i to come to you with a stick or with love in a spirit of gentleness,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1
5354,1CO,5,NRSV,it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that is not found even among pagans for a man is living with his fathers wife,you therefore beloved since you are forewarned beware that you are not carried away with the error of the lawless and lose your own stability,1
5355,1CO,5,NRSV,and you are arrogant should you not rather have mourned so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you,some sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no children the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1
5356,1CO,5,NRSV,for though absent in body i am present in spirit and as if present i have already pronounced judgment in the name of the lord jesus on the man who has done such a thing,and no one after drinking old wine desires new wine but says the old is good,1
5357,1CO,5,NRSV,when you are assembled and my spirit is present with the power of our lord jesus you are to hand this man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the lord,and jesus increased in wisdom and in years and in divine and human favor,1
5358,1CO,5,NRSV,your boasting is not a good thing,david himself by the holy spirit declared the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet,1
5359,1CO,5,NRSV,do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,i myself did not know him but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you see the spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the holy spirit,1
5360,1CO,5,NRSV,clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch as you really are unleavened,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true,1
5361,1CO,5,NRSV,for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,1
5362,1CO,5,NRSV,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,on one occasion when jesus was going to the house of a leader of the pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath they were watching him closely,1
5363,1CO,5,NRSV,i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral persons not at all meaning the immoral of this world or the greedy and robbers or idolaters since you would then need to go out of the world,when jesus had received the wine he said it is finished,1
5364,1CO,5,NRSV,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber,then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat,1
5365,1CO,5,NRSV,do not even eat with such a one,the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective,1
5366,1CO,5,NRSV,for what have i to do with judging those outside,now when jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all waiting for him,1
5367,1CO,5,NRSV,is it not those who are inside that you are to judge,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,1
5368,1CO,5,NRSV,drive out the wicked person from among you,and to the angel of the church in pergamum write these are the words of him who has the sharp twoedged sword i know where you are living where satans throne is,1
5369,1CO,6,NRSV,when any of you has a grievance against another do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it before the saints,do bear with me i feel a divine jealousy for you for i promised you in marriage to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to christ,1
5370,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that the saints will judge the world,when he reached the place he said to them pray that you may not come into the time of trial,1
5371,1CO,6,NRSV,and if the world is to be judged by you are you incompetent to try trivial cases,the nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,1
5372,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that we are to judge angelsto say nothing of ordinary matters,and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning,1
5373,1CO,6,NRSV,if you have ordinary cases then do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church,i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg,1
5374,1CO,6,NRSV,i say this to your shame,when they heard this they said heaven forbid but he looked at them and said what then does this text mean the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,1
5375,1CO,6,NRSV,can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another but a believer goes to court against a believer and before unbelievers at that,for this reason jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters saying i will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters in the midst of the congregation i will praise you,1
5376,1CO,6,NRSV,in fact to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you,of course there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment for we brought nothing into the world so that we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with these,1
5377,1CO,6,NRSV,but you yourselves wrong and defraudand believers at that,but others said how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs,1
5378,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god,then i saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it the earth and the heaven fled from his presence and no place was found for them,1
5379,1CO,6,NRSV,do not be deceived fornicators idolaters adulterers male prostitutes sodomites thieves the greedy drunkards revilers robbersnone of these will inherit the kingdom of god,there will be two women grinding meal together one will be taken and the other left,1
5380,1CO,6,NRSV,and this is what some of you used to be,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband,1
5381,1CO,6,NRSV,but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised,1
5382,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but not all things are beneficial,but the magician elymas for that is the translation of his name opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith,1
5383,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but i will not be dominated by anything,jesus said to them the light is with you for a little longer,1
5384,1CO,6,NRSV,food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food and god will destroy both one and the other,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me,1
5385,1CO,6,NRSV,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me,1
5386,1CO,6,NRSV,and god raised the lord and will also raise us by his power,and they filled them up to the brim,1
5387,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that your bodies are members of christ,i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them,1
5388,1CO,6,NRSV,should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about,1
5389,1CO,6,NRSV,never do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her,i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,1
5390,1CO,6,NRSV,for it is said the two shall be one flesh,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,1
5391,1CO,6,NRSV,but anyone united to the lord becomes one spirit with him,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,1
5392,1CO,6,NRSV,shun fornication every sin that a person commits is outside the body but the fornicator sins against the body itself,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,1
5393,1CO,6,NRSV,or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from god and that you are not your own,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore,1
5394,1CO,6,NRSV,for you were bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body,as soon as he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john whose other name was mark where many had gathered and were praying,1
5395,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning the matters about which you wrote it is well for a man not to touch a woman,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt,1
5396,1CO,7,NRSV,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband,it has the glory of god and a radiance like a very rare jewel like jasper clear as crystal,1
5397,1CO,7,NRSV,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband,and a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him,1
5398,1CO,7,NRSV,for the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does,so they went out and proclaimed that all should repent,1
5399,1CO,7,NRSV,do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer and then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down,1
5400,1CO,7,NRSV,this i say by way of concession not of command,and when the chief shepherd appears you will win the crown of glory that never fades away,1
5401,1CO,7,NRSV,i wish that all were as i myself am,but the throne of god and of the lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads,1
5402,1CO,7,NRSV,but each has a particular gift from god one having one kind and another a different kind,now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting and people came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast,1
5403,1CO,7,NRSV,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am,and are not all his sisters with us,1
5404,1CO,7,NRSV,but if they are not practicing selfcontrol they should marry,they took the body of jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths according to the burial custom of the jews,1
5405,1CO,7,NRSV,for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion,the eye is the lamp of the body,1
5406,1CO,7,NRSV,to the married i give this commandnot i but the lordthat the wife should not separate from her husband but if she does separate let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and that the husband should not divorce his wife,now a bishop must be above reproach married only once temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money,1
5407,1CO,7,NRSV,to the rest i sayi and not the lordthat if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1
5408,1CO,7,NRSV,and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her she should not divorce him,now there were seven brothers the first married and died childless then the second and the third married her and so in the same way all seven died childless,1
5409,1CO,7,NRSV,for the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband,for the seven had married her,1
5410,1CO,7,NRSV,otherwise your children would be unclean but as it is they are holy,when he had said this he died,1
5411,1CO,7,NRSV,but if the unbelieving partner separates let it be so in such a case the brother or sister is not bound,in christ jesus then i have reason to boast of my work for god,1
5412,1CO,7,NRSV,it is to peace that god has called you,but one is tempted by ones own desire being lured and enticed by it then when that desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and that sin when it is fully grown gives birth to death,1
5413,1CO,7,NRSV,wife for all you know you might save your husband,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles,1
5414,1CO,7,NRSV,husband for all you know you might save your wife,he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out,1
5415,1CO,7,NRSV,however that may be let each of you lead the life that the lord has assigned to which god called you,but who indeed are you a human being to argue with god,1
5416,1CO,7,NRSV,this is my rule in all the churches,for nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light,1
5417,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,greet my beloved epaenetus who was the first convert in asia for christ,1
5418,1CO,7,NRSV,let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly,1
5419,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised,prompted by her mother she said give me the head of john the baptist here on a platter,1
5420,1CO,7,NRSV,circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but obeying the commandments of god is everything,for truly i tell you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you,1
5421,1CO,7,NRSV,let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called,and suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting,1
5422,1CO,7,NRSV,were you a slave when called,from them i also received letters to the brothers in damascus and i went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to jerusalem for punishment,1
5423,1CO,7,NRSV,do not be concerned about it,all who are with me send greetings to you,1
5424,1CO,7,NRSV,even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever,to that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints,1
5425,1CO,7,NRSV,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,1
5426,1CO,7,NRSV,you were bought with a price do not become slaves of human masters,it is by your holding fast to the word of life that i can boast on the day of christ that i did not run in vain or labor in vain,1
5427,1CO,7,NRSV,in whatever condition you were called brothers and sisters there remain with god,for it is indeed just of god to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus,1
5428,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning virgins i have no command of the lord but i give my opinion as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy,fear came over all their neighbors and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of judea,1
5429,1CO,7,NRSV,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account,1
5430,1CO,7,NRSV,are you bound to a wife,so he told them this parable which one of you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them does not leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it,1
5431,1CO,7,NRSV,do not seek to be free,now this is an allegory these women are two covenants,1
5432,1CO,7,NRSV,are you free from a wife,the father judges no one but has given all judgment to the son so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father,1
5433,1CO,7,NRSV,but if you marry you do not sin and if a virgin marries she does not sin,later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen,1
5434,1CO,7,NRSV,yet those who marry will experience distress in this life and i would spare you that,on that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you,1
5435,1CO,7,NRSV,i mean brothers and sisters the appointed time has grown short from now on let even those who have wives be as though they had none and those who mourn as though they were not mourning and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they had no possessions and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it,then peter said can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the holy spirit just as we have,1
5436,1CO,7,NRSV,for the present form of this world is passing away,then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom,1
5437,1CO,7,NRSV,i want you to be free from anxieties,i appeal to you therefore brothers and sisters by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual worship,1
5438,1CO,7,NRSV,the unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the lord how to please the lord but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please his wife and his interests are divided,for certain intruders have stolen in among you people who long ago were designated for this condemnation as ungodly who pervert the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ,1
5439,1CO,7,NRSV,and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband,he came to what was his own and his own people did not accept him,1
5440,1CO,7,NRSV,i say this for your own benefit not to put any restraint upon you but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the lord,do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,1
5441,1CO,7,NRSV,if anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancee if his passions are strong and so it has to be let him marry as he wishes it is no sin,i am writing to you fathers because you know him who is from the beginning,1
5442,1CO,7,NRSV,but if someone stands firm in his resolve being under no necessity but having his own desire under control and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee he will do well,as you enter the house greet it,1
5443,1CO,7,NRSV,so then he who marries his fiancee does well and he who refrains from marriage will do better,so the slave returned and reported this to his master,1
5444,1CO,7,NRSV,a wife is bound as long as her husband lives,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,1
5445,1CO,7,NRSV,but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes only in the lord,but jesus perceiving their thoughts said why do you think evil in your hearts,1
5446,1CO,7,NRSV,but in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is,then they brought him to the ship,1
5447,1CO,7,NRSV,and i think that i too have the spirit of god,for you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us we were not idle when we were with you and we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you,1
5448,1CO,8,NRSV,now concerning food sacrificed to idols we know that all of us possess knowledge,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,1
5449,1CO,8,NRSV,knowledge puffs up but love builds up,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,1
5450,1CO,8,NRSV,anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge but anyone who loves god is known by him,anyone who does not have the spirit of christ does not belong to him,1
5451,1CO,8,NRSV,hence as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that no idol in the world really exists and that there is no god but one,jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty,1
5452,1CO,8,NRSV,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist,therefore his parents said he is of age ask him,1
5453,1CO,8,NRSV,it is not everyone however who has this knowledge,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,1
5454,1CO,8,NRSV,since some have become so accustomed to idols until now they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1
5455,1CO,8,NRSV,food will not bring us close to god,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,1
5456,1CO,8,NRSV,we are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do,for time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice obtained promises shut the mouths of lions quenched raging fire escaped the edge of the sword won strength out of weakness became mighty in war put foreign armies to flight,1
5457,1CO,8,NRSV,but take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak,for god is my witness how i long for all of you with the compassion of christ jesus,1
5458,1CO,8,NRSV,for if others see you who possess knowledge eating in the temple of an idol might they not since their conscience is weak be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons,1
5459,1CO,8,NRSV,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed,i commend to you our sister phoebe a deacon of the church at cenchreae so that you may welcome her in the lord as is fitting for the saints and help her in whatever she may require from you for she has been a benefactor of many and of myself as well,1
5460,1CO,8,NRSV,but when you thus sin against members of your family and wound their conscience when it is weak you sin against christ,surely he will not come to the festival will he,1
5461,1CO,8,NRSV,therefore if food is a cause of their falling i will never eat meat so that i may not cause one of them to fall,beloved i am writing you no new commandment but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word that you have heard,1
5462,1CO,9,NRSV,have i not seen jesus our lord,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,1
5463,1CO,9,NRSV,are you not my work in the lord,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,1
5464,1CO,9,NRSV,if i am not an apostle to others at least i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,1
5465,1CO,9,NRSV,this is my defense to those who would examine me,come lord jesus the grace of the lord jesus be with all the saints,1
5466,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to our food and drink,therefore he has also said in another psalm you will not let your holy one experience corruption,1
5467,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas,if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me,1
5468,1CO,9,NRSV,or is it only barnabas and i who have no right to refrain from working for a living,it is the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life they will wither away,1
5469,1CO,9,NRSV,who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service,when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day as was his custom,1
5470,1CO,9,NRSV,who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,1
5471,1CO,9,NRSV,or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,1
5472,1CO,9,NRSV,do i say this on human authority,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,1
5473,1CO,9,NRSV,does not the law also say the same,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,1
5474,1CO,9,NRSV,for it is written in the law of moses you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,after this i looked and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues robed in pure bright linen with golden sashes across their chests,1
5475,1CO,9,NRSV,is it for oxen that god is concerned,he has been raised he is not here,1
5476,1CO,9,NRSV,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet,1
5477,1CO,9,NRSV,it was indeed written for our sake for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals,1
5478,1CO,9,NRSV,if we have sown spiritual good among you is it too much if we reap your material benefits,i think that i am not in the least inferior to these superapostles,1
5479,1CO,9,NRSV,if others share this rightful claim on you do not we still more,but some of them joined him and became believers including dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them,1
5480,1CO,9,NRSV,nevertheless we have not made use of this right but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of christ,in his testimony about him he said i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who will carry out all my wishes,1
5481,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar,but all his acquaintances including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things,1
5482,1CO,9,NRSV,in the same way the lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel,after staying there for a considerable time paul said farewell to the believers and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila,1
5483,1CO,9,NRSV,but i have made no use of any of these rights nor am i writing this so that they may be applied in my case,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,1
5484,1CO,9,NRSV,indeed i would rather die than thatno one will deprive me of my ground for boasting if i proclaim the gospel this gives me no ground for boasting for an obligation is laid on me and woe to me if i do not proclaim the gospel for if i do this of my own will i have a reward but if not of my own will i am entrusted with a commission,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,1
5485,1CO,9,NRSV,just this that in my proclamation i may make the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel,then i saw thrones and those seated on them were given authority to judge,1
5486,1CO,9,NRSV,for though i am free with respect to all i have made myself a slave to all so that i might win more of them,now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side,1
5487,1CO,9,NRSV,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike,1
5488,1CO,9,NRSV,to those under the law i became as one under the law though i myself am not under the law so that i might win those under the law,but he said to them you give them something to eat,1
5489,1CO,9,NRSV,to those outside the law i became as one outside the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so that i might win those outside the law,there he became the father of two sons,1
5490,1CO,9,NRSV,to the weak i became weak so that i might win the weak,after agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard,1
5491,1CO,9,NRSV,i have become all things to all people that i might by all means save some,as he was going down his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive,1
5492,1CO,9,NRSV,i do it all for the sake of the gospel so that i may share in its blessings,and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband,1
5493,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that in a race the runners all compete but only one receives the prize,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask,1
5494,1CO,9,NRSV,run in such a way that you may win it,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,1
5495,1CO,9,NRSV,athletes exercise selfcontrol in all things they do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an imperishable one,but jesus said to them because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you,1
5496,1CO,9,NRSV,so i do not run aimlessly nor do i box as though beating the air but i punish my body and enslave it so that after proclaiming to others i myself should not be disqualified,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,1
5497,1CO,10,NRSV,i do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink,but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have died,1
5498,1CO,10,NRSV,for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ,i fear that when i come again my god may humble me before you and that i may have to mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced,1
5499,1CO,10,NRSV,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness,it opened for them of its own accord and they went outside and walked along a lane when suddenly the angel left him,1
5500,1CO,10,NRSV,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did,nicodemus who had at first come to jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds,1
5501,1CO,10,NRSV,do not become idolaters as some of them did as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play,jesus answered them the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified,1
5502,1CO,10,NRSV,we must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did and twentythree thousand fell in a single day,when jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king he withdrew again to the mountain by himself,1
5503,1CO,10,NRSV,we must not put christ to the test as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,peter went out and followed him he did not realize that what was happening with the angels help was real he thought he was seeing a vision,1
5504,1CO,10,NRSV,and do not complain as some of them did and were destroyed by the destroyer,this phrase yet once more indicates the removal of what is shakenthat is created thingsso that what cannot be shaken may remain,1
5505,1CO,10,NRSV,these things happened to them to serve as an example and they were written down to instruct us on whom the ends of the ages have come,then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first,1
5506,1CO,10,NRSV,so if you think you are standing watch out that you do not fall,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1
5507,1CO,10,NRSV,no testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,1
5508,1CO,10,NRSV,god is faithful and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever,1
5509,1CO,10,NRSV,therefore my dear friends flee from the worship of idols,then philip began to speak and starting with this scripture he proclaimed to him the good news about jesus,1
5510,1CO,10,NRSV,i speak as to sensible people judge for yourselves what i say,but he denied it saying woman i do not know him,1
5511,1CO,10,NRSV,the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a sharing in the blood of christ,so because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i am about to spit you out of my mouth,1
5512,1CO,10,NRSV,the bread that we break is it not a sharing in the body of christ,king herod heard of it for jesus name had become known,1
5513,1CO,10,NRSV,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread,they said to her you are out of your mind but she insisted that it was so,1
5514,1CO,10,NRSV,consider the people of israel are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,1
5515,1CO,10,NRSV,that food sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children,1
5516,1CO,10,NRSV,no i imply that what pagans sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to god,immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way,1
5517,1CO,10,NRSV,i do not want you to be partners with demons,as it is written he scatters abroad he gives to the poor his righteousness endures forever,1
5518,1CO,10,NRSV,you cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace,1
5519,1CO,10,NRSV,you cannot partake of the table of the lord and the table of demons,for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality,1
5520,1CO,10,NRSV,or are we provoking the lord to jealousy,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment,1
5521,1CO,10,NRSV,all things are lawful but not all things are beneficial,but if through my falsehood gods truthfulness abounds to his glory why am i still being condemned as a sinner,1
5522,1CO,10,NRSV,all things are lawful but not all things build up,grace be with all who have an undying love for our lord jesus christ,1
5523,1CO,10,NRSV,do not seek your own advantage but that of the other,she kept doing this for many days,1
5524,1CO,10,NRSV,eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience for the earth and its fullness are the lords,i am the root and the descendant of david the bright morning star,1
5525,1CO,10,NRSV,if an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience,this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son,1
5526,1CO,10,NRSV,but if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it out of consideration for the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience i mean the others conscience not your own,remember then what you received and heard obey it and repent,1
5527,1CO,10,NRSV,for why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone elses conscience,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god to the saints who are in ephesus and are faithful in christ jesus grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1
5528,1CO,10,NRSV,if i partake with thankfulness why should i be denounced because of that for which i give thanks,and you child will be called the prophet of the most high for you will go before the lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins,1
5529,1CO,10,NRSV,so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do everything for the glory of god,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd,1
5530,1CO,10,NRSV,give no offense to jews or to greeks or to the church of god just as i try to please everyone in everything i do not seeking my own advantage but that of many so that they may be saved,and he said to them to you has been given the secret of the kingdom of god but for those outside everything comes in parables in order that they may indeed look but not perceive and may indeed listen but not understand so that they may not turn again and be forgiven,1
5531,1CO,11,NRSV,be imitators of me as i am of christ,indeed i would rather die than thatno one will deprive me of my ground for boasting if i proclaim the gospel this gives me no ground for boasting for an obligation is laid on me and woe to me if i do not proclaim the gospel for if i do this of my own will i have a reward but if not of my own will i am entrusted with a commission,1
5532,1CO,11,NRSV,i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you,you have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter,1
5533,1CO,11,NRSV,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband is the head of his wife and god is the head of christ,in the days of his flesh jesus offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission,1
5534,1CO,11,NRSV,any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head disgraces his head but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved,he was well spoken of by the believers in lystra and iconium,1
5535,1CO,11,NRSV,for if a woman will not veil herself then she should cut off her hair but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved she should wear a veil,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea,1
5536,1CO,11,NRSV,for a man ought not to have his head veiled since he is the image and reflection of god but woman is the reflection of man,but peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them men of judea and all who live in jerusalem let this be known to you and listen to what i say,1
5537,1CO,11,NRSV,indeed man was not made from woman but woman from man,pilate answered what i have written i have written,1
5538,1CO,11,NRSV,neither was man created for the sake of woman but woman for the sake of man,they will tell you about everything here,1
5539,1CO,11,NRSV,for this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah remains forever,1
5540,1CO,11,NRSV,nevertheless in the lord woman is not independent of man or man independent of woman,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage,1
5541,1CO,11,NRSV,for just as woman came from man so man comes through woman but all things come from god,but i have made no use of any of these rights nor am i writing this so that they may be applied in my case,1
5542,1CO,11,NRSV,judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray to god with her head unveiled,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles,1
5543,1CO,11,NRSV,does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is degrading to him but if a woman has long hair it is her glory,when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted,1
5544,1CO,11,NRSV,for her hair is given to her for a covering,then you will begin to say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets,1
5545,1CO,11,NRSV,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god,for a man ought not to have his head veiled since he is the image and reflection of god but woman is the reflection of man,1
5546,1CO,11,NRSV,now in the following instructions i do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man,1
5547,1CO,11,NRSV,for to begin with when you come together as a church i hear that there are divisions among you and to some extent i believe it,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons,1
5548,1CO,11,NRSV,indeed there have to be factions among you for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine,let the word of christ dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs to god,1
5549,1CO,11,NRSV,when you come together it is not really to eat the lords supper,for we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law,1
5550,1CO,11,NRSV,for when the time comes to eat each of you goes ahead with your own supper and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk,when john heard in prison what the messiah was doing he sent word by his disciples and said to him are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another,1
5551,1CO,11,NRSV,what do you not have homes to eat and drink in,and when you see the south wind blowing you say there will be scorching heat and it happens,1
5552,1CO,11,NRSV,or do you show contempt for the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me,1
5553,1CO,11,NRSV,what should i say to you,see i am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves,1
5554,1CO,11,NRSV,in this matter i do not commend you for i received from the lord what i also handed on to you that the lord jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body that is for you,when the whole crowd saw him they were immediately overcome with awe and they ran forward to greet him,1
5555,1CO,11,NRSV,do this in remembrance of me,immediately while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders,1
5556,1CO,11,NRSV,in the same way he took the cup also after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood,for in those days there will be suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that god created until now no and never will be,1
5557,1CO,11,NRSV,do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me,i have said nothing in secret,1
5558,1CO,11,NRSV,for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes,setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land he gave a great shout like a lion roaring,1
5559,1CO,11,NRSV,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord,god is faithful and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it,1
5560,1CO,11,NRSV,examine yourselves and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup,let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others,1
5561,1CO,11,NRSV,for all who eat and drink without discerning the body eat and drink judgment against themselves,and to what should i compare it,1
5562,1CO,11,NRSV,for this reason many of you are weak and ill and some have died,truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,1
5563,1CO,11,NRSV,but if we judged ourselves we would not be judged,i john am the one who heard and saw these things,1
5564,1CO,11,NRSV,but when we are judged by the lord we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed,1
5565,1CO,11,NRSV,so then my brothers and sisters when you come together to eat wait for one another,everyone who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous,1
5566,1CO,11,NRSV,if you are hungry eat at home so that when you come together it will not be for your condemnation,woe to you who are full now for you will be hungry,1
5567,1CO,11,NRSV,about the other things i will give instructions when i come,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber,1
5568,1CO,12,NRSV,now concerning spiritual gifts brothers and sisters i do not want you to be uninformed,after they had set a day to meet with him they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers,1
5569,1CO,12,NRSV,you know that when you were pagans you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak,so take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents,1
5570,1CO,12,NRSV,therefore i want you to understand that no one speaking by the spirit of god ever says let jesus be cursed and no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit,every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,1
5571,1CO,12,NRSV,now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of services but the same lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone,husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word so as to present the church to himself in splendor without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kindyes so that she may be holy and without blemish,1
5572,1CO,12,NRSV,to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse,1
5573,1CO,12,NRSV,to one is given through the spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the one spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another the discernment of spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,1
5574,1CO,12,NRSV,all these are activated by one and the same spirit who allots to each one individually just as the spirit chooses,whoever does good is from god whoever does evil has not seen god,1
5575,1CO,12,NRSV,for just as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body though many are one body so it is with christ,but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written,1
5576,1CO,12,NRSV,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit,greet ampliatus my beloved in the lord,1
5577,1CO,12,NRSV,indeed the body does not consist of one member but of many,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,1
5578,1CO,12,NRSV,if the foot would say because i am not a hand i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body,for what the flesh desires is opposed to the spirit and what the spirit desires is opposed to the flesh for these are opposed to each other to prevent you from doing what you want,1
5579,1CO,12,NRSV,and if the ear would say because i am not an eye i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead,1
5580,1CO,12,NRSV,if the whole body were an eye where would the hearing be,confident of your obedience i am writing to you knowing that you will do even more than i say,1
5581,1CO,12,NRSV,if the whole body were hearing where would the sense of smell be,but they understood nothing about all these things in fact what he said was hidden from them and they did not grasp what was said,1
5582,1CO,12,NRSV,but as it is god arranged the members in the body each one of them as he chose,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish,1
5583,1CO,12,NRSV,if all were a single member where would the body be,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name,1
5584,1CO,12,NRSV,as it is there are many members yet one body,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet i will open my mouth to speak in parables i will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world,1
5585,1CO,12,NRSV,the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of you nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you,as jannes and jambres opposed moses so these people of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith also oppose the truth,1
5586,1CO,12,NRSV,on the contrary the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect whereas our more respectable members do not need this,they were expecting him to swell up or drop dead but after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing unusual had happened to him they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god,1
5587,1CO,12,NRSV,but god has so arranged the body giving the greater honor to the inferior member that there may be no dissension within the body but the members may have the same care for one another,then he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute and they distributed them to the crowd,1
5588,1CO,12,NRSV,if one member suffers all suffer together with it if one member is honored all rejoice together with it,in christ we have also obtained an inheritance having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will so that we who were the first to set our hope on christ might live for the praise of his glory,1
5589,1CO,12,NRSV,now you are the body of christ and individually members of it,i know them and they follow me,1
5590,1CO,12,NRSV,and god has appointed in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then deeds of power then gifts of healing forms of assistance forms of leadership various kinds of tongues,therefore god also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bend in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father,1
5591,1CO,12,NRSV,do all possess gifts of healing,when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him,1
5592,1CO,12,NRSV,but strive for the greater gifts,so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say,1
5593,1CO,12,NRSV,and i will show you a still more excellent way,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit,1
5594,1CO,13,NRSV,if i speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels but do not have love i am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal,the disciples said to him where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd,1
5595,1CO,13,NRSV,and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love i am nothing,for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many,1
5596,1CO,13,NRSV,if i give away all my possessions and if i hand over my body so that i may boast but do not have love i gain nothing,instead strive for his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well,1
5597,1CO,13,NRSV,love is patient love is kind love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude,but do not ignore this one fact beloved that with the lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day,1
5598,1CO,13,NRSV,it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice in wrongdoing but rejoices in the truth,then jesus cried aloud whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me,1
5599,1CO,13,NRSV,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him,1
5600,1CO,13,NRSV,but as for prophecies they will come to an end as for tongues they will cease as for knowledge it will come to an end,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,1
5601,1CO,13,NRSV,for we know only in part and we prophesy only in part but when the complete comes the partial will come to an end,for if god did not spare the natural branches perhaps he will not spare you,1
5602,1CO,13,NRSV,when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put an end to childish ways,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1
5603,1CO,13,NRSV,for now we see in a mirror dimly but then we will see face to face,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith the lord replied if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you,1
5604,1CO,13,NRSV,now i know only in part then i will know fully even as i have been fully known,when he had removed him he made david their king,1
5605,1CO,13,NRSV,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate,1
5606,1CO,14,NRSV,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you,1
5607,1CO,14,NRSV,for those who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to god for nobody understands them since they are speaking mysteries in the spirit,and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us,1
5608,1CO,14,NRSV,on the other hand those who prophesy speak to other people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation,from his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of god the almighty,1
5609,1CO,14,NRSV,those who speak in a tongue build up themselves but those who prophesy build up the church,you that abhor idols do you rob temples,1
5610,1CO,14,NRSV,now i would like all of you to speak in tongues but even more to prophesy,jesus said to them come and have breakfast,1
5611,1CO,14,NRSV,one who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may be built up,for this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead so that though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged they might live in the spirit as god does,1
5612,1CO,14,NRSV,now brothers and sisters if i come to you speaking in tongues how will i benefit you unless i speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching,a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was already being swamped,1
5613,1CO,14,NRSV,it is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound such as the flute or the harp,in the days of king herod of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of abijah,1
5614,1CO,14,NRSV,if they do not give distinct notes how will anyone know what is being played,my brothers and sisters whenever you face trials of any kind consider it nothing but joy because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its full effect so that you may be mature and complete lacking in nothing,1
5615,1CO,14,NRSV,and if the bugle gives an indistinct sound who will get ready for battle,no one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends,1
5616,1CO,14,NRSV,so with yourselves if in a tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible how will anyone know what is being said,then the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching,1
5617,1CO,14,NRSV,for you will be speaking into the air,then the high priest asked him are these things so,1
5618,1CO,14,NRSV,there are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world and nothing is without sound,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years and though she had spent all she had on physicians no one could cure her,1
5619,1CO,14,NRSV,if then i do not know the meaning of a sound i will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman,1
5620,1CO,14,NRSV,so with yourselves since you are eager for spiritual gifts strive to excel in them for building up the church,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves,1
5621,1CO,14,NRSV,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret,you know the message he sent to the people of israel preaching peace by jesus christhe is lord of all,1
5622,1CO,14,NRSV,for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive,these are the ways you also once followed when you were living that life,1
5623,1CO,14,NRSV,i will pray with the spirit but i will pray with the mind also i will sing praise with the spirit but i will sing praise with the mind also,because you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hates you,1
5624,1CO,14,NRSV,otherwise if you say a blessing with the spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the amen to your thanksgiving since the outsider does not know what you are saying,so they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening,1
5625,1CO,14,NRSV,for you may give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up,then he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are persecuting,1
5626,1CO,14,NRSV,i thank god that i speak in tongues more than all of you nevertheless in church i would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others also than ten thousand words in a tongue,after the reading of the law and the prophets the officials of the synagogue sent them a message saying brothers if you have any word of exhortation for the people give it,1
5627,1CO,14,NRSV,brothers and sisters do not be children in your thinking rather be infants in evil but in thinking be adults,then all of them seized sosthenes the official of the synagogue and beat him in front of the tribunal,1
5628,1CO,14,NRSV,in the law it is written by people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners i will speak to this people yet even then they will not listen to me says the lord,blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted,1
5629,1CO,14,NRSV,tongues then are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers,indeed they cannot die anymore because they are like angels and are children of god being children of the resurrection,1
5630,1CO,14,NRSV,if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your mind,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin,1
5631,1CO,14,NRSV,but if all prophesy an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all,woe to you blind guides who say whoever swears by the sanctuary is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath,1
5632,1CO,14,NRSV,after the secrets of the unbelievers heart are disclosed that person will bow down before god and worship him declaring god is really among you,do you not know brothers and sisters for i am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only during that persons lifetime,1
5633,1CO,14,NRSV,what should be done then my friends,for to me living is christ and dying is gain,1
5634,1CO,14,NRSV,when you come together each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation,should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave as i had mercy on you,1
5635,1CO,14,NRSV,let all things be done for building up,let the word of christ dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs to god,1
5636,1CO,14,NRSV,if anyone speaks in a tongue let there be only two or at most three and each in turn and let one interpret,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea,1
5637,1CO,14,NRSV,but if there is no one to interpret let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to god,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1
5638,1CO,14,NRSV,let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said,greet andronicus and junia my relatives who were in prison with me they are prominent among the apostles and they were in christ before i was,1
5639,1CO,14,NRSV,if a revelation is made to someone else sitting nearby let the first person be silent,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me,1
5640,1CO,14,NRSV,for you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged,so if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision,1
5641,1CO,14,NRSV,and the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets for god is a god not of disorder but of peace,the works that i do in my fathers name testify to me but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep,1
5642,1CO,14,NRSV,as in all the churches of the saints women should be silent in the churches,the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice,1
5643,1CO,14,NRSV,for they are not permitted to speak but should be subordinate as the law also says,so he went in to stay with them,1
5644,1CO,14,NRSV,if there is anything they desire to know let them ask their husbands at home,then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power,1
5645,1CO,14,NRSV,for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church,so i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may dwell in me,1
5646,1CO,14,NRSV,or did the word of god originate with you,but by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the godless,1
5647,1CO,14,NRSV,or are you the only ones it has reached anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must acknowledge that what i am writing to you is a command of the lord,the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for fortytwo months,1
5648,1CO,14,NRSV,anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized,whoever conquers will not be harmed by the second death,1
5649,1CO,14,NRSV,so my friends be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues but all things should be done decently and in order,one day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go across to the other side of the lake,1
5650,1CO,15,NRSV,now i would remind you brothers and sisters of the good news that i proclaimed to you which you in turn received in which also you stand through which also you are being saved if you hold firmly to the message that i proclaimed to youunless you have come to believe in vain,and we will do this if god permits,1
5651,1CO,15,NRSV,for i handed on to you as of first importance what i in turn had received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve, then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength,1
5652,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did,1
5653,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to james then to all the apostles,they were allowed to torture them for five months but not to kill them and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone,1
5654,1CO,15,NRSV,last of all as to one untimely born he appeared also to me,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living,1
5655,1CO,15,NRSV,for i am the least of the apostles unfit to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,1
5656,1CO,15,NRSV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me has not been in vain,but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days,1
5657,1CO,15,NRSV,on the contrary i worked harder than any of themthough it was not i but the grace of god that is with me,drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman,1
5658,1CO,15,NRSV,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe,now brothers and sisters if i come to you speaking in tongues how will i benefit you unless i speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching,1
5659,1CO,15,NRSV,now if christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound had been healed,1
5660,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain,jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband,1
5661,1CO,15,NRSV,we are even found to be misrepresenting god because we testified of god that he raised christwhom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised,for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification,1
5662,1CO,15,NRSV,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified,1
5663,1CO,15,NRSV,if christ has not been raised your faith is futile and you are still in your sins,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation,1
5664,1CO,15,NRSV,then those also who have died in christ have perished,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep,1
5665,1CO,15,NRSV,if for this life only we have hoped in christ we are of all people most to be pitied,when his disciples james and john saw it they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them,1
5666,1CO,15,NRSV,but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have died,at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples were hungry and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat,1
5667,1CO,15,NRSV,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ,where then did these weeds come from,1
5668,1CO,15,NRSV,but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at his coming those who belong to christ,so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him because he was going to pass that way,1
5669,1CO,15,NRSV,then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1
5670,1CO,15,NRSV,for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven,1
5671,1CO,15,NRSV,the last enemy to be destroyed is death,jesus said i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind,1
5672,1CO,15,NRSV,for god has put all things in subjection under his feet,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1
5673,1CO,15,NRSV,but when it says all things are put in subjection it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him,but i say to you do not resist an evildoer,1
5674,1CO,15,NRSV,when all things are subjected to him then the son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him so that god may be all in all,after that he must be let out for a little while,1
5675,1CO,15,NRSV,otherwise what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,1
5676,1CO,15,NRSV,if the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized on their behalf,then they asked him where lord,1
5677,1CO,15,NRSV,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour,now herod the ruler heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen,1
5678,1CO,15,NRSV,i die every day that is as certain brothers and sisters as my boasting of youa boast that i make in christ jesus our lord,but the wise replied no there will not be enough for you and for us you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves,1
5679,1CO,15,NRSV,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it,and the fact that the dead are raised moses himself showed in the story about the bush where he speaks of the lord as the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,1
5680,1CO,15,NRSV,if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die,and jesus answered him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven,1
5681,1CO,15,NRSV,do not be deceived bad company ruins good morals,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory,1
5682,1CO,15,NRSV,come to a sober and right mind and sin no more for some people have no knowledge of god,the friends who are with me greet you,1
5683,1CO,15,NRSV,i say this to your shame,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did,1
5684,1CO,15,NRSV,but someone will ask how are the dead raised,you are aware that all who are in asia have turned away from me including phygelus and hermogenes,1
5685,1CO,15,NRSV,with what kind of body do they come,david thus calls him lord so how can he be his son,1
5686,1CO,15,NRSV,fool what you sow does not come to life unless it dies,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life,1
5687,1CO,15,NRSV,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain,and pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother,1
5688,1CO,15,NRSV,but god gives it a body as he has chosen and to each kind of seed its own body,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus,1
5689,1CO,15,NRSV,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish,i left you behind in crete for this reason so that you should put in order what remained to be done and should appoint elders in every town as i directed you someone who is blameless married only once whose children are believers not accused of debauchery and not rebellious,1
5690,1CO,15,NRSV,there are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one thing and that of the earthly is another,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy,1
5691,1CO,15,NRSV,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory,those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered,1
5692,1CO,15,NRSV,so it is with the resurrection of the dead,and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all,1
5693,1CO,15,NRSV,what is sown is perishable what is raised is imperishable,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor,1
5694,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory,you are indeed doing what your father does,1
5695,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in weakness it is raised in power,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1
5696,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown a physical body it is raised a spiritual body,beloved if our hearts do not condemn us we have boldness before god and we receive from him whatever we ask because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him,1
5697,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is a physical body there is also a spiritual body,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also and jason has entertained them as guests,1
5698,1CO,15,NRSV,thus it is written the first man adam became a living being the last adam became a lifegiving spirit,as to his raising him from the dead no more to return to corruption he has spoken in this way i will give you the holy promises made to david,1
5699,1CO,15,NRSV,but it is not the spiritual that is first but the physical and then the spiritual,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished,1
5700,1CO,15,NRSV,the first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is from heaven,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down,1
5701,1CO,15,NRSV,as was the man of dust so are those who are of the dust and as is the man of heaven so are those who are of heaven,but i tell you on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you,1
5702,1CO,15,NRSV,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven,but if i do them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i am in the father,1
5703,1CO,15,NRSV,what i am saying brothers and sisters is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away,1
5704,1CO,15,NRSV,listen i will tell you a mystery we will not all die but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee,1
5705,1CO,15,NRSV,for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed,three times i was shipwrecked for a night and a day i was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from bandits danger from my own people danger from gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers and sisters in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night hungry and thirsty often without food cold and naked,1
5706,1CO,15,NRSV,for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him,1
5707,1CO,15,NRSV,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory,every day he was teaching in the temple and at night he would go out and spend the night on the mount of olives as it was called,1
5708,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your victory,day after day i sat in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me,1
5709,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your sting,how is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart,1
5710,1CO,15,NRSV,the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed,1
5711,1CO,15,NRSV,but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,1
5712,1CO,15,NRSV,therefore my beloved be steadfast immovable always excelling in the work of the lord because you know that in the lord your labor is not in vain,nothing accursed will be found there any more,1
5713,1CO,16,NRSV,now concerning the collection for the saints you should follow the directions i gave to the churches of galatia,jesus went through one town and village after another teaching as he made his way to jerusalem,1
5714,1CO,16,NRSV,on the first day of every week each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn so that collections need not be taken when i come,let your speech always be gracious seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone,1
5715,1CO,16,NRSV,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,1
5716,1CO,16,NRSV,if it seems advisable that i should go also they will accompany me,we do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters of the affliction we experienced in asia for we were so utterly unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself,1
5717,1CO,16,NRSV,i will visit you after passing through macedoniafor i intend to pass through macedonia and perhaps i will stay with you or even spend the winter so that you may send me on my way wherever i go,woe to you pharisees for you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,1
5718,1CO,16,NRSV,i do not want to see you now just in passing for i hope to spend some time with you if the lord permits,if the foot would say because i am not a hand i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body,1
5719,1CO,16,NRSV,but i will stay in ephesus until pentecost for a wide door for effective work has opened to me and there are many adversaries,jesus answered is it not written in your law i said you are gods,1
5720,1CO,16,NRSV,if timothy comes see that he has nothing to fear among you for he is doing the work of the lord just as i am therefore let no one despise him,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,1
5721,1CO,16,NRSV,send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am expecting him with the brothers,can a demon open the eyes of the blind,1
5722,1CO,16,NRSV,now concerning our brother apollos i strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers but he was not at all willing to come now,i myself paul appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of christi who am humble when face to face with you but bold toward you when i am away i ask that when i am present i need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards,1
5723,1CO,16,NRSV,he will come when he has the opportunity,the friends who are with me greet you,1
5724,1CO,16,NRSV,keep alert stand firm in your faith be courageous be strong,let a woman learn in silence with full submission,1
5725,1CO,16,NRSV,let all that you do be done in love,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,1
5726,1CO,16,NRSV,now brothers and sisters you know that members of the household of stephanas were the first converts in achaia and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints i urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people and of everyone who works and toils with them,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover,1
5727,1CO,16,NRSV,i rejoice at the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus because they have made up for your absence for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours,when jesus had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him saying lord if you choose you can make me clean,1
5728,1CO,16,NRSV,so give recognition to such persons,then jesus answered her woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish,1
5729,1CO,16,NRSV,the churches of asia send greetings,they answered him no he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some,1
5730,1CO,16,NRSV,aquila and prisca together with the church in their house greet you warmly in the lord,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me,1
5731,1CO,16,NRSV,all the brothers and sisters send greetings,for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years,1
5732,1CO,16,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss,a certain woman named lydia a worshiper of god was listening to us she was from the city of thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth,1
5733,1CO,16,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,and they praised the god of israel,1
5734,1CO,16,NRSV,let anyone be accursed who has no love for the lord,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world,1
5735,1CO,16,NRSV,our lord come the grace of the lord jesus be with you,but thanks be to god who put in the heart of titus the same eagerness for you that i myself have,1
5736,1CO,16,NRSV,my love be with all of you in christ jesus,paul said but i was born a citizen,1
5737,2CO,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the church of god that is in corinth including all the saints throughout achaia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,therefore i sent for you immediately and you have been kind enough to come,1
5738,2CO,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all consolation who consoles us in all our affliction so that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction with the consolation with which we ourselves are consoled by god,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints,1
5739,2CO,1,NRSV,for just as the sufferings of christ are abundant for us so also our consolation is abundant through christ,but jesus came and touched them saying get up and do not be afraid,1
5740,2CO,1,NRSV,if we are being afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation if we are being consoled it is for your consolation which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,1
5741,2CO,1,NRSV,our hope for you is unshaken for we know that as you share in our sufferings so also you share in our consolation,from morning until evening he explained the matter to them testifying to the kingdom of god and trying to convince them about jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets,1
5742,2CO,1,NRSV,we do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters of the affliction we experienced in asia for we were so utterly unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name,1
5743,2CO,1,NRSV,indeed we felt that we had received the sentence of death so that we would rely not on ourselves but on god who raises the dead,then jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so also the fish as much as they wanted,1
5744,2CO,1,NRSV,he who rescued us from so deadly a peril will continue to rescue us on him we have set our hope that he will rescue us again as you also join in helping us by your prayers so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many,so if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out,1
5745,2CO,1,NRSV,indeed this is our boast the testimony of our conscience we have behaved in the world with frankness and godly sincerity not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of godand all the more toward you,other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain,1
5746,2CO,1,NRSV,for we write you nothing other than what you can read and also understand i hope you will understand until the end as you have already understood us in partthat on the day of the lord jesus we are your boast even as you are our boast,now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized he left judea and started back to galilee,1
5747,2CO,1,NRSV,since i was sure of this i wanted to come to you first so that you might have a double favor i wanted to visit you on my way to macedonia and to come back to you from macedonia and have you send me on to judea,so we have known and believe the love that god has for us,1
5748,2CO,1,NRSV,was i vacillating when i wanted to do this,if then there is any encouragement in christ any consolation from love any sharing in the spirit any compassion and sympathy make my joy complete be of the same mind having the same love being in full accord and of one mind,1
5749,2CO,1,NRSV,do i make my plans according to ordinary human standards ready to say yes yes and no no at the same time,tomorrow he said you will hear him,1
5750,2CO,1,NRSV,as surely as god is faithful our word to you has not been yes and no for the son of god jesus christ whom we proclaimed among you silvanus and timothy and i was not yes and no but in him it is always yes,tell me so that i may believe in him,1
5751,2CO,1,NRSV,for in him every one of gods promises is a yes,when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled back,1
5752,2CO,1,NRSV,for this reason it is through him that we say the amen to the glory of god,he answered i tell you if these were silent the stones would shout out,1
5753,2CO,1,NRSV,but it is god who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts as a first installment,the beast that you saw was and is not and is about to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to destruction,1
5754,2CO,1,NRSV,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth,likewise tell the older women to be reverent in behavior not to be slanderers or slaves to drink they are to teach what is good so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children to be selfcontrolled chaste good managers of the household kind being submissive to their husbands so that the word of god may not be discredited,1
5755,2CO,1,NRSV,i do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith rather we are workers with you for your joy because you stand firm in the faith,to everyone who conquers and continues to do my works to the end i will give authority over the nations to rule them with an iron rod as when clay pots are shattered even as i also received authority from my father,1
5756,2CO,2,NRSV,so i made up my mind not to make you another painful visit,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1
5757,2CO,2,NRSV,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,1
5758,2CO,2,NRSV,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you,what deeds of power are being done by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us,1
5759,2CO,2,NRSV,for i wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that i have for you,he intended to pass them by,1
5760,2CO,2,NRSV,but if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but to some extentnot to exaggerate itto all of you,and there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds,1
5761,2CO,2,NRSV,this punishment by the majority is enough for such a person so now instead you should forgive and console him so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow,and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith,1
5762,2CO,2,NRSV,so i urge you to reaffirm your love for him,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism,1
5763,2CO,2,NRSV,i wrote for this reason to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything,they put him to death by hanging him on a tree but god raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear not to all the people but to us who were chosen by god as witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead,1
5764,2CO,2,NRSV,anyone whom you forgive i also forgive,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house,1
5765,2CO,2,NRSV,what i have forgiven if i have forgiven anything has been for your sake in the presence of christ,so they took the money and did as they were directed,1
5766,2CO,2,NRSV,and we do this so that we may not be outwitted by satan for we are not ignorant of his designs,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right,1
5767,2CO,2,NRSV,when i came to troas to proclaim the good news of christ a door was opened for me in the lord but my mind could not rest because i did not find my brother titus there,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me,1
5768,2CO,2,NRSV,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,but truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god,1
5769,2CO,2,NRSV,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings,1
5770,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are the aroma of christ to god among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing to the one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life,and all ate and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish,1
5771,2CO,2,NRSV,who is sufficient for these things,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,1
5772,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are not peddlers of gods word like so many but in christ we speak as persons of sincerity as persons sent from god and standing in his presence,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before,1
5773,2CO,3,NRSV,are we beginning to commend ourselves again,do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world,1
5774,2CO,3,NRSV,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you,1
5775,2CO,3,NRSV,you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts to be known and read by all and you show that you are a letter of christ prepared by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,1
5776,2CO,3,NRSV,such is the confidence that we have through christ toward god,rejoice then you heavens and those who dwell in them but woe to the earth and the sea for the devil has come down to you with great wrath because he knows that his time is short so when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child,1
5777,2CO,3,NRSV,not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us our competence is from god who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not of letter but of spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds he also adds i will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more,1
5778,2CO,3,NRSV,now if the ministry of death chiseled in letters on stone tablets came in glory so that the people of israel could not gaze at moses face because of the glory of his face a glory now set aside how much more will the ministry of the spirit come in glory,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,1
5779,2CO,3,NRSV,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets,1
5780,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day when they hear the reading of the old covenant that same veil is still there since only in christ is it set aside,beloved do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good,1
5781,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed,let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of god and the teaching may not be blasphemed,1
5782,2CO,3,NRSV,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom,when he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor he told them a parable,1
5783,2CO,3,NRSV,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit,on the first day of every week each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn so that collections need not be taken when i come,1
5784,2CO,4,NRSV,therefore since it is by gods mercy that we are engaged in this ministry we do not lose heart,for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are yet without sin,1
5785,2CO,4,NRSV,we have renounced the shameful things that one hides we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify gods word but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of god,jesus answered him are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things,1
5786,2CO,4,NRSV,and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing,avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith,1
5787,2CO,4,NRSV,in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god,at the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds then he and his entire family were baptized without delay,1
5788,2CO,4,NRSV,for we do not proclaim ourselves we proclaim jesus christ as lord and ourselves as your slaves for jesus sake,he said i have sinned by betraying innocent blood,1
5789,2CO,4,NRSV,for it is the god who said let light shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ,they went through the region of phrygia and galatia having been forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in asia,1
5790,2CO,4,NRSV,but we have this treasure in clay jars so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to god and does not come from us,i have applied all this to apollos and myself for your benefit brothers and sisters so that you may learn through us the meaning of the saying nothing beyond what is written so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another,1
5791,2CO,4,NRSV,we are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not driven to despair persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed always carrying in the body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be made visible in our bodies,when it comes it finds it swept and put in order,1
5792,2CO,4,NRSV,for while we live we are always being given up to death for jesus sake so that the life of jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven,1
5793,2CO,4,NRSV,so death is at work in us but life in you,is not this the carpenters son,1
5794,2CO,4,NRSV,but just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripturei believed and so i spokewe also believe and so we speak because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus will raise us also with jesus and will bring us with you into his presence,there is no fear of god before their eyes,1
5795,2CO,4,NRSV,yes everything is for your sake so that grace as it extends to more and more people may increase thanksgiving to the glory of god,now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized he left judea and started back to galilee,1
5796,2CO,4,NRSV,so we do not lose heart,but he replied no for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them,1
5797,2CO,4,NRSV,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,she was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight,1
5798,2CO,4,NRSV,for this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal,but they kept asking him then how were your eyes opened,1
5799,2CO,5,NRSV,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity,1
5800,2CO,5,NRSV,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus,1
5801,2CO,5,NRSV,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life,then they said what further testimony do we need,1
5802,2CO,5,NRSV,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee,the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each one to his home and you will leave me alone,1
5803,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness,1
5804,2CO,5,NRSV,yes we do have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord,when paul had been summoned tertullus began to accuse him saying your excellency because of you we have long enjoyed peace and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight,1
5805,2CO,5,NRSV,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,and he called them to him and spoke to them in parables how can satan cast out satan,1
5806,2CO,5,NRSV,for all of us must appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body whether good or evil,on one occasion when jesus was going to the house of a leader of the pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath they were watching him closely,1
5807,2CO,5,NRSV,therefore knowing the fear of the lord we try to persuade others but we ourselves are well known to god and i hope that we are also well known to your consciences,he said to them but who do you say that i am,1
5808,2CO,5,NRSV,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death,1
5809,2CO,5,NRSV,for if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right mind it is for you,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us,1
5810,2CO,5,NRSV,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment,1
5811,2CO,5,NRSV,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them,in the morning when he returned to the city he was hungry,1
5812,2CO,5,NRSV,from now on therefore we regard no one from a human point of view even though we once knew christ from a human point of view we know him no longer in that way,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1
5813,2CO,5,NRSV,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover,1
5814,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god,the elder to the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not only i but also all who know the truth because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the fathers son in truth and love,1
5815,2CO,5,NRSV,for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,1
5816,2CO,6,NRSV,as we work together with him we urge you also not to accept the grace of god in vain,when they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them,1
5817,2CO,6,NRSV,for he says at an acceptable time i have listened to you and on a day of salvation i have helped you,jesus replied a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and fell into the hands of robbers who stripped him beat him and went away leaving him half dead,1
5818,2CO,6,NRSV,see now is the acceptable time see now is the day of salvation we are putting no obstacle in anyones way so that no fault may be found with our ministry but as servants of god we have commended ourselves in every way through great endurance in afflictions hardships calamities beatings imprisonments riots labors sleepless nights hunger by purity knowledge patience kindness holiness of spirit genuine love truthful speech and the power of god with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left in honor and dishonor in ill repute and good repute,from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force,1
5819,2CO,6,NRSV,we are treated as impostors and yet are true as unknown and yet are well known as dying and seewe are alive as punished and yet not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing everything,then they asked him where lord,1
5820,2CO,6,NRSV,we have spoken frankly to you corinthians our heart is wide open to you,but the word of god is not chained,1
5821,2CO,6,NRSV,there is no restriction in our affections but only in yours,coming from the throne are flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches which are the seven spirits of god and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass like crystal,1
5822,2CO,6,NRSV,in returni speak as to childrenopen wide your hearts also,i have been a fool you forced me to it,1
5823,2CO,6,NRSV,do not be mismatched with unbelievers,for the seven had married her,1
5824,2CO,6,NRSV,for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart,1
5825,2CO,6,NRSV,or what fellowship is there between light and darkness,but when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they would not believe it,1
5826,2CO,6,NRSV,what agreement does christ have with beliar,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants,1
5827,2CO,6,NRSV,or what does a believer share with an unbeliever,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true,1
5828,2CO,6,NRSV,what agreement has the temple of god with idols,if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you,1
5829,2CO,6,NRSV,for we are the temple of the living god as god said i will live in them and walk among them and i will be their god and they shall be my people,woe to them for they go the way of cain and abandon themselves to balaams error for the sake of gain and perish in korahs rebellion,1
5830,2CO,6,NRSV,therefore come out from them and be separate from them says the lord and touch nothing unclean then i will welcome you and i will be your father and you shall be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty,and why do you worry about clothing,1
5831,2CO,7,NRSV,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1
5832,2CO,7,NRSV,make room in your hearts for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love,1
5833,2CO,7,NRSV,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together,he said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at capernaum,1
5834,2CO,7,NRSV,i often boast about you i have great pride in you i am filled with consolation i am overjoyed in all our affliction,in our prayers for you we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ for we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints because of the hope laid up for you in heaven,1
5835,2CO,7,NRSV,for even when we came into macedonia our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted in every waydisputes without and fears within,why do you not understand what i say,1
5836,2CO,7,NRSV,but god who consoles the downcast consoled us by the arrival of titus and not only by his coming but also by the consolation with which he was consoled about you as he told us of your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that i rejoiced still more,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,1
5837,2CO,7,NRSV,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard,1
5838,2CO,7,NRSV,now i rejoice not because you were grieved but because your grief led to repentance for you felt a godly grief so that you were not harmed in any way by us,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me,1
5839,2CO,7,NRSV,for godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret but worldly grief produces death,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast,1
5840,2CO,7,NRSV,for see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what zeal what punishment at every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter,jesus said to her your brother will rise again,1
5841,2CO,7,NRSV,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god,for three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth,1
5842,2CO,7,NRSV,in addition to our own consolation we rejoiced still more at the joy of titus because his mind has been set at rest by all of you,listen the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you kept back by fraud cry out and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts,1
5843,2CO,7,NRSV,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well,let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision,1
5844,2CO,7,NRSV,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat,1
5845,2CO,7,NRSV,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you,when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god,1
5846,2CO,8,NRSV,we want you to know brothers and sisters about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,1
5847,2CO,8,NRSV,for as i can testify they voluntarily gave according to their means and even beyond their means begging us earnestly for the privilege of sharing in this ministry to the saints and this not merely as we expected they gave themselves first to the lord and by the will of god to us so that we might urge titus that as he had already made a beginning so he should also complete this generous undertaking among you,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place,1
5848,2CO,8,NRSV,now as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in utmost eagerness and in our love for you so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking,so when they had come together they asked him lord is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to israel,1
5849,2CO,8,NRSV,i do not say this as a command but i am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others,jesus answered them very truly i tell you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin,1
5850,2CO,8,NRSV,for you know the generous act of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that by his poverty you might become rich,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home,1
5851,2CO,8,NRSV,and in this matter i am giving my advice it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something now finish doing it so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means,so do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows,1
5852,2CO,8,NRSV,for if the eagerness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one hasnot according to what one does not have,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days,1
5853,2CO,8,NRSV,i do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you but it is a question of a fair balance between your present abundance and their need so that their abundance may be for your need in order that there may be a fair balance,having started with the spirit are you now ending with the flesh,1
5854,2CO,8,NRSV,as it is written the one who had much did not have too much and the one who had little did not have too little,we also testify for him and you know that our testimony is true,1
5855,2CO,8,NRSV,but thanks be to god who put in the heart of titus the same eagerness for you that i myself have,for if the eagerness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one hasnot according to what one does not have,1
5856,2CO,8,NRSV,for he not only accepted our appeal but since he is more eager than ever he is going to you of his own accord,now therefore why are you putting god to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear,1
5857,2CO,8,NRSV,with him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his proclaiming the good news and not only that but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this generous undertaking for the glory of the lord himself and to show our goodwill,he said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you became believers,1
5858,2CO,8,NRSV,we intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering for we intend to do what is right not only in the lords sight but also in the sight of others,it was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him,1
5859,2CO,8,NRSV,and with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found eager in many matters but who is now more eager than ever because of his great confidence in you,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region,1
5860,2CO,8,NRSV,as for titus he is my partner and coworker in your service as for our brothers they are messengers of the churches the glory of christ,and they said to him lord he has ten pounds i tell you to all those who have more will be given but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1
5861,2CO,8,NRSV,therefore openly before the churches show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you,peace i leave with you my peace i give to you,1
5862,2CO,9,NRSV,now it is not necessary for me to write you about the ministry to the saints for i know your eagerness which is the subject of my boasting about you to the people of macedonia saying that achaia has been ready since last year and your zeal has stirred up most of them,jesus asked them how many loaves have you,1
5863,2CO,9,NRSV,but i am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you may not prove to have been empty in this case so that you may be ready as i said you would be otherwise if some macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready we would be humiliatedto say nothing of youin this undertaking,you have the words of eternal life,1
5864,2CO,9,NRSV,so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for this bountiful gift that you have promised so that it may be ready as a voluntary gift and not as an extortion,worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy,1
5865,2CO,9,NRSV,the point is this the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully,and while the blood of your witness stephen was shed i myself was standing by approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him,1
5866,2CO,9,NRSV,each of you must give as you have made up your mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming,1
5867,2CO,9,NRSV,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work,for all of us make many mistakes,1
5868,2CO,9,NRSV,as it is written he scatters abroad he gives to the poor his righteousness endures forever,then jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves,1
5869,2CO,9,NRSV,he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness,they came to life and reigned with christ a thousand years,1
5870,2CO,9,NRSV,you will be enriched in every way for your great generosity which will produce thanksgiving to god through us for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to god,he also measured its wall one hundred fortyfour cubits by human measurement which the angel was using,1
5871,2CO,9,NRSV,through the testing of this ministry you glorify god by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of god that he has given you,but he answered them you give them something to eat,1
5872,2CO,9,NRSV,thanks be to god for his indescribable gift,and they came and said to him teacher we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with truth,1
5873,2CO,10,NRSV,i myself paul appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of christi who am humble when face to face with you but bold toward you when i am away i ask that when i am present i need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards,then they spat in his face and struck him and some slapped him saying prophesy to us you messiah who is it that struck you,1
5874,2CO,10,NRSV,indeed we live as human beings but we do not wage war according to human standards for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human but they have divine power to destroy strongholds,he said to him teacher i have kept all these since my youth,1
5875,2CO,10,NRSV,we destroy arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of god and we take every thought captive to obey christ,but they went away and spread the news about him throughout that district,1
5876,2CO,10,NRSV,we are ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete,no one will snatch them out of my hand,1
5877,2CO,10,NRSV,look at what is before your eyes,they have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him,1
5878,2CO,10,NRSV,if you are confident that you belong to christ remind yourself of this that just as you belong to christ so also do we,and he went away and began to proclaim in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed,1
5879,2CO,10,NRSV,now even if i boast a little too much of our authority which the lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down i will not be ashamed of it,from that time on jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,1
5880,2CO,10,NRSV,i do not want to seem as though i am trying to frighten you with my letters,immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd,1
5881,2CO,10,NRSV,for they say his letters are weighty and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible,while he clung to peter and john all the people ran together to them in the portico called solomons portico utterly astonished,1
5882,2CO,10,NRSV,let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent we will also do when present,and there will be no more night they need no light of lamp or sun for the lord god will be their light and they will reign forever and ever,1
5883,2CO,10,NRSV,we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves,for truly i tell you until heaven and earth pass away not one letter not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished,1
5884,2CO,10,NRSV,but when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another they do not show good sense,each of you however should love his wife as himself and a wife should respect her husband,1
5885,2CO,10,NRSV,we however will not boast beyond limits but will keep within the field that god has assigned to us to reach out even as far as you,now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the night in prayer to god,1
5886,2CO,10,NRSV,for we were not overstepping our limits when we reached you we were the first to come all the way to you with the good news of christ,anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle,1
5887,2CO,10,NRSV,we do not boast beyond limits that is in the labors of others but our hope is that as your faith increases our sphere of action among you may be greatly enlarged so that we may proclaim the good news in lands beyond you without boasting of work already done in someone elses sphere of action,you have laid up treasure for the last days,1
5888,2CO,10,NRSV,let the one who boasts boast in the lord,so they answered jesus we do not know,1
5889,2CO,10,NRSV,for it is not those who commend themselves that are approved but those whom the lord commends,for there is no distinction between jew and greek the same lord is lord of all and is generous to all who call on him,1
5890,2CO,11,NRSV,i wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness,their throats are opened graves they use their tongues to deceive,1
5891,2CO,11,NRSV,do bear with me i feel a divine jealousy for you for i promised you in marriage to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to christ,peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time do you love me,1
5892,2CO,11,NRSV,but i am afraid that as the serpent deceived eve by its cunning your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to christ,when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul,1
5893,2CO,11,NRSV,for if someone comes and proclaims another jesus than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you submit to it readily enough,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right,1
5894,2CO,11,NRSV,i think that i am not in the least inferior to these superapostles,through the spirit they told paul not to go on to jerusalem,1
5895,2CO,11,NRSV,i may be untrained in speech but not in knowledge certainly in every way and in all things we have made this evident to you,we are weak but you are strong,1
5896,2CO,11,NRSV,did i commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted because i proclaimed gods good news to you free of charge,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea,1
5897,2CO,11,NRSV,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you,then he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and stay awake with me,1
5898,2CO,11,NRSV,and when i was with you and was in need i did not burden anyone for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from macedonia,now the disciples had forgotten to bring any bread and they had only one loaf with them in the boat,1
5899,2CO,11,NRSV,so i refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way,so he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,1
5900,2CO,11,NRSV,as the truth of christ is in me this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of achaia,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me,1
5901,2CO,11,NRSV,because i do not love you,so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing tychicus will tell you everything,1
5902,2CO,11,NRSV,god knows i do and what i do i will also continue to do in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about,take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls,1
5903,2CO,11,NRSV,for such boasters are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ,she went out and said to her mother what should i ask for,1
5904,2CO,11,NRSV,and no wonder even satan disguises himself as an angel of light,they did so and made them all sit down,1
5905,2CO,11,NRSV,so it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness,as he stepped out on land a man of the city who had demons met him,1
5906,2CO,11,NRSV,their end will match their deeds,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean,1
5907,2CO,11,NRSV,i repeat let no one think that i am a fool but if you do then accept me as a fool so that i too may boast a little,as indeed he says in hosea those who were not my people i will call my people and her who was not beloved i will call beloved,1
5908,2CO,11,NRSV,what i am saying in regard to this boastful confidence i am saying not with the lords authority but as a fool since many boast according to human standards i will also boast,but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent our ancestors there on their first visit,1
5909,2CO,11,NRSV,for you gladly put up with fools being wise yourselves for you put up with it when someone makes slaves of you or preys upon you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or gives you a slap in the face,and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the lord,1
5910,2CO,11,NRSV,to my shame i must say we were too weak for that but whatever anyone dares to boast ofi am speaking as a fooli also dare to boast of that,peace to all of you who are in christ,1
5911,2CO,11,NRSV,i am talking like a madmani am a better one with far greater labors far more imprisonments with countless floggings and often near death,and the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one,1
5912,2CO,11,NRSV,five times i have received from the jews the forty lashes minus one,when the festival was ended and they started to return the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but his parents did not know it,1
5913,2CO,11,NRSV,three times i was beaten with rods,in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan,1
5914,2CO,11,NRSV,three times i was shipwrecked for a night and a day i was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from bandits danger from my own people danger from gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers and sisters in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night hungry and thirsty often without food cold and naked,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me,1
5915,2CO,11,NRSV,and besides other things i am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches,there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love,1
5916,2CO,11,NRSV,who is weak and i am not weak,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ,1
5917,2CO,11,NRSV,who is made to stumble and i am not indignant,tychicus will tell you all the news about me he is a beloved brother a faithful minister and a fellow servant in the lord,1
5918,2CO,11,NRSV,if i must boast i will boast of the things that show my weakness,how have you been worse off than the other churches except that i myself did not burden you,1
5919,2CO,11,NRSV,the god and father of the lord jesus blessed be he forever knows that i do not lie,your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you will name him john,1
5920,2CO,11,NRSV,in damascus the governor under king aretas guarded the city of damascus in order to seize me but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands,blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe,1
5921,2CO,12,NRSV,it is necessary to boast nothing is to be gained by it but i will go on to visions and revelations of the lord,peter began to say to him look we have left everything and followed you,1
5922,2CO,12,NRSV,i know a person in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heavenwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows,isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him,1
5923,2CO,12,NRSV,and i know that such a personwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows was caught up into paradise and heard things that are not to be told that no mortal is permitted to repeat,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,1
5924,2CO,12,NRSV,on behalf of such a one i will boast but on my own behalf i will not boast except of my weaknesses,this will give you an opportunity to testify,1
5925,2CO,12,NRSV,but if i wish to boast i will not be a fool for i will be speaking the truth,now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding and the demons begged jesus to let them enter these,1
5926,2CO,12,NRSV,but i refrain from it so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me even considering the exceptional character of the revelations,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,1
5927,2CO,12,NRSV,therefore to keep me from being too elated a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to torment me to keep me from being too elated,now the festival of unleavened bread which is called the passover was near,1
5928,2CO,12,NRSV,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness,but i am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you may not prove to have been empty in this case so that you may be ready as i said you would be otherwise if some macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready we would be humiliatedto say nothing of youin this undertaking,1
5929,2CO,12,NRSV,so i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may dwell in me,since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach phoenix where they could spend the winter,1
5930,2CO,12,NRSV,therefore i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for the sake of christ for whenever i am weak then i am strong,he said where have you laid him,1
5931,2CO,12,NRSV,i have been a fool you forced me to it,and the man sprang up and began to walk,1
5932,2CO,12,NRSV,indeed you should have been the ones commending me for i am not at all inferior to these superapostles even though i am nothing,for we are the temple of the living god as god said i will live in them and walk among them and i will be their god and they shall be my people,1
5933,2CO,12,NRSV,the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience signs and wonders and mighty works,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1
5934,2CO,12,NRSV,how have you been worse off than the other churches except that i myself did not burden you,now there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon this man was righteous and devout looking forward to the consolation of israel and the holy spirit rested on him,1
5935,2CO,12,NRSV,forgive me this wrong here i am ready to come to you this third time,on his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed king of kings and lord of lords,1
5936,2CO,12,NRSV,and i will not be a burden because i do not want what is yours but you for children ought not to lay up for their parents but parents for their children,she never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day,1
5937,2CO,12,NRSV,i will most gladly spend and be spent for you,then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off,1
5938,2CO,12,NRSV,if i love you more am i to be loved less,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying god forbid it lord this must never happen to you,1
5939,2CO,12,NRSV,let it be assumed that i did not burden you,as for us brothers and sisters when for a short time we were made orphans by being separated from youin person not in heartwe longed with great eagerness to see you face to face,1
5940,2CO,12,NRSV,nevertheless you say since i was crafty i took you in by deceit,now we command you beloved in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us,1
5941,2CO,12,NRSV,did i take advantage of you through any of those whom i sent to you,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,1
5942,2CO,12,NRSV,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him,but among them were some men of cyprus and cyrene who on coming to antioch spoke to the hellenists also proclaiming the lord jesus,1
5943,2CO,12,NRSV,titus did not take advantage of you did he,the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom and the favor of god was upon him,1
5944,2CO,12,NRSV,did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit,for we ourselves were once foolish disobedient led astray slaves to various passions and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy despicable hating one another,1
5945,2CO,12,NRSV,did we not take the same steps,he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him can you see anything,1
5946,2CO,12,NRSV,have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you,let no evil talk come out of your mouths but only what is useful for building up as there is need so that your words may give grace to those who hear,1
5947,2CO,12,NRSV,we are speaking in christ before god,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven,1
5948,2CO,12,NRSV,everything we do beloved is for the sake of building you up,now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching himthat she is a sinner,1
5949,2CO,12,NRSV,for i fear that when i come i may find you not as i wish and that you may find me not as you wish i fear that there may perhaps be quarreling jealousy anger selfishness slander gossip conceit and disorder,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it,1
5950,2CO,12,NRSV,i fear that when i come again my god may humble me before you and that i may have to mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced,blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh,1
5951,2CO,13,NRSV,this is the third time i am coming to you,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,1
5952,2CO,13,NRSV,any charge must be sustained by the evidence of two or three witnesses,but if i wish to boast i will not be a fool for i will be speaking the truth,1
5953,2CO,13,NRSV,i warned those who sinned previously and all the others and i warn them now while absent as i did when present on my second visit that if i come again i will not be lenient since you desire proof that christ is speaking in me,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea,1
5954,2CO,13,NRSV,he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful in you,and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all,1
5955,2CO,13,NRSV,for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god,i am giving you these commands so that you may love one another,1
5956,2CO,13,NRSV,for we are weak in him but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of god,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing,1
5957,2CO,13,NRSV,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith,to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,1
5958,2CO,13,NRSV,do you not realize that jesus christ is in youunless indeed you fail to meet the test i hope you will find out that we have not failed,do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows,1
5959,2CO,13,NRSV,but we pray to god that you may not do anything wrongnot that we may appear to have met the test but that you may do what is right though we may seem to have failed,but gallio paid no attention to any of these things,1
5960,2CO,13,NRSV,for we cannot do anything against the truth but only for the truth,every sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and would try to convince jews and greeks,1
5961,2CO,13,NRSV,for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel,1
5962,2CO,13,NRSV,this is what we pray for that you may become perfect,but about that day and hour no one knows neither the angels of heaven nor the son but only the father,1
5963,2CO,13,NRSV,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down,are not all angels spirits in the divine service sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation,1
5964,2CO,13,NRSV,put things in order listen to my appeal agree with one another live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you,you do not realize that you are wretched pitiable poor blind and naked,1
5965,2CO,13,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss,there they gave a dinner for him,1
5966,2CO,13,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with all of you,for he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in christ but of suffering for him as well since you are having the same struggle that you saw i had and now hear that i still have,1
5967,GAL,1,NRSV,paul an apostlesent neither by human commission nor from human authorities but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the members of gods family who are with me to the churches of galatia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age according to the will of our god and father to whom be the glory forever and ever,the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep hear his voice,1
5968,GAL,1,NRSV,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ,both of them were righteous before god living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the lord,1
5969,GAL,1,NRSV,but even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you let that one be accursed as we have said before so now i repeat if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received let that one be accursed am i now seeking human approval or gods approval,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up,1
5970,GAL,1,NRSV,or am i trying to please people,after saying this he remained in galilee,1
5971,GAL,1,NRSV,if i were still pleasing people i would not be a servant of christ,for ever since our ancestors died all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation they deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of god heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished,1
5972,GAL,1,NRSV,for i want you to know brothers and sisters that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin for i did not receive it from a human source nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ,our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem,1
5973,GAL,1,NRSV,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism,he answered here i am lord,1
5974,GAL,1,NRSV,i was violently persecuting the church of god and was trying to destroy it,i have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete,1
5975,GAL,1,NRSV,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,1
5976,GAL,1,NRSV,but when god who had set me apart before i was born and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me so that i might proclaim him among the gentiles i did not confer with any human being nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me but i went away at once into arabia and afterwards i returned to damascus,he replied how can i unless someone guides me,1
5977,GAL,1,NRSV,then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit cephas and stayed with him fifteen days but i did not see any other apostle except james the lords brother,but jesus answered you do not know what you are asking,1
5978,GAL,1,NRSV,in what i am writing to you before god i do not lie then i went into the regions of syria and cilicia and i was still unknown by sight to the churches of judea that are in christ they only heard it said the one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy,the friends who are with me greet you,1
5979,GAL,1,NRSV,and they glorified god because of me,the word of god continued to spread the number of the disciples increased greatly in jerusalem and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith,1
5980,GAL,2,NRSV,then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus along with me,we have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right to eat,1
5981,GAL,2,NRSV,i went up in response to a revelation,he said to them this kind can come out only through prayer,1
5982,GAL,2,NRSV,then i laid before them though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders the gospel that i proclaim among the gentiles in order to make sure that i was not running or had not run in vain,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god,1
5983,GAL,2,NRSV,but even titus who was with me was not compelled to be circumcised though he was a greek,then simeon blessed them and said to his mother mary this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealedand a sword will pierce your own soul too,1
5984,GAL,2,NRSV,but because of false believers secretly brought in who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus so that they might enslave us we did not submit to them even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you,i have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in egypt and have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them,1
5985,GAL,2,NRSV,and from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders what they actually were makes no difference to me god shows no partialitythose leaders contributed nothing to me,by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin,1
5986,GAL,2,NRSV,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised,he sold a field that belonged to him then brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet,1
5987,GAL,2,NRSV,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was eager to do,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain,1
5988,GAL,2,NRSV,but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood selfcondemned for until certain people came from james he used to eat with the gentiles,the crowds were saying this is the prophet jesus from nazareth in galilee,1
5989,GAL,2,NRSV,but after they came he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction,when we heard this we and the people there urged him not to go up to jerusalem,1
5990,GAL,2,NRSV,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy,does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks,1
5991,GAL,2,NRSV,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,1
5992,GAL,2,NRSV,we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,1
5993,GAL,2,NRSV,and we have come to believe in christ jesus so that we might be justified by faith in christ and not by doing the works of the law because no one will be justified by the works of the law,when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul,1
5994,GAL,2,NRSV,but if in our effort to be justified in christ we ourselves have been found to be sinners is christ then a servant of sin,this calls for wisdom let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a person,1
5995,GAL,2,NRSV,certainly not but if i build up again the very things that i once tore down then i demonstrate that i am a transgressor,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,1
5996,GAL,2,NRSV,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god,this took place in bethany across the jordan where john was baptizing,1
5997,GAL,2,NRSV,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing,1
5998,GAL,2,NRSV,and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me,the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well,1
5999,GAL,2,NRSV,i do not nullify the grace of god for if justification comes through the law then christ died for nothing,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy,1
6000,GAL,3,NRSV,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you,they went to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i pray,1
6001,GAL,3,NRSV,it was before your eyes that jesus christ was publicly exhibited as crucified the only thing i want to learn from you is this did you receive the spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard,for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit,1
6002,GAL,3,NRSV,having started with the spirit are you now ending with the flesh,some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath,1
6003,GAL,3,NRSV,did you experience so much for nothingif it really was for nothing,if you do not have that discipline in which all children share then you are illegitimate and not his children,1
6004,GAL,3,NRSV,well then does god supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard,as he approached the gate of the town a man who had died was being carried out,1
6005,GAL,3,NRSV,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham,let us have an answer for those who sent us,1
6006,GAL,3,NRSV,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith declared the gospel beforehand to abraham saying all the gentiles shall be blessed in you,so let no one boast about human leaders,1
6007,GAL,3,NRSV,for this reason those who believe are blessed with abraham who believed,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart,1
6008,GAL,3,NRSV,for all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law,and thus abraham having patiently endured obtained the promise,1
6009,GAL,3,NRSV,now it is evident that no one is justified before god by the law for the one who is righteous will live by faith,claiming to be wise they became fools and they exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or fourfooted animals or reptiles,1
6010,GAL,3,NRSV,but the law does not rest on faith on the contrary whoever does the works of the law will live by them,all of them condemned him as deserving death,1
6011,GAL,3,NRSV,christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for usfor it is written cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree in order that in christ jesus the blessing of abraham might come to the gentiles so that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith,and when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you,1
6012,GAL,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters i give an example from daily life once a persons will has been ratified no one adds to it or annuls it,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd,1
6013,GAL,3,NRSV,now the promises were made to abraham and to his offspring it does not say and to offsprings as of many but it says and to your offspring that is to one person who is christ,and the spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness,1
6014,GAL,3,NRSV,my point is this the law which came four hundred thirty years later does not annul a covenant previously ratified by god so as to nullify the promise,and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you forever,1
6015,GAL,3,NRSV,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise,and let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs so that they may not be unproductive,1
6016,GAL,3,NRSV,it was added because of transgressions until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made and it was ordained through angels by a mediator,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus,1
6017,GAL,3,NRSV,now a mediator involves more than one party but god is one,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god,1
6018,GAL,3,NRSV,is the law then opposed to the promises of god,someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me,1
6019,GAL,3,NRSV,certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law,but i have a few things against you you have some there who hold to the teaching of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the people of israel so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice fornication,1
6020,GAL,3,NRSV,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,and as he talked with him he went in and found that many had assembled and he said to them you yourselves know that it is unlawful for a jew to associate with or to visit a gentile but god has shown me that i should not call anyone profane or unclean,1
6021,GAL,3,NRSV,now before faith came we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends,1
6022,GAL,3,NRSV,therefore the law was our disciplinarian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith,then the disciples returned to their homes,1
6023,GAL,3,NRSV,but now that faith has come we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian for in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith,then the twentyfour elders who sit on their thrones before god fell on their faces and worshiped god singing we give you thanks lord god almighty who are and who were for you have taken your great power and begun to reign,1
6024,GAL,3,NRSV,as many of you as were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ,when he was in jerusalem during the passover festival many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing,1
6025,GAL,3,NRSV,there is no longer jew or greek there is no longer slave or free there is no longer male and female for all of you are one in christ jesus,the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well,1
6026,GAL,3,NRSV,and if you belong to christ then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to the promise,as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil,1
6027,GAL,4,NRSV,my point is this heirs as long as they are minors are no better than slaves though they are the owners of all the property but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father,he called the crowd with his disciples and said to them if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me,1
6028,GAL,4,NRSV,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard,1
6029,GAL,4,NRSV,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor,1
6030,GAL,4,NRSV,and because you are children god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father so you are no longer a slave but a child and if a child then also an heir through god,after there had been much debate peter stood up and said to them my brothers you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that i should be the one through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers,1
6031,GAL,4,NRSV,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,all were amazed and perplexed saying to one another what does this mean,1
6032,GAL,4,NRSV,now however that you have come to know god or rather to be known by god how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits,do you not know that in a race the runners all compete but only one receives the prize,1
6033,GAL,4,NRSV,how can you want to be enslaved to them again,then they came and laid hands on jesus and arrested him,1
6034,GAL,4,NRSV,you are observing special days and months and seasons and years,now the woman was a gentile of syrophoenician origin,1
6035,GAL,4,NRSV,i am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted,for just as the sufferings of christ are abundant for us so also our consolation is abundant through christ,1
6036,GAL,4,NRSV,friends i beg you become as i am for i also have become as you are,so we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed,1
6037,GAL,4,NRSV,you have done me no wrong,then jesus told them plainly lazarus is dead,1
6038,GAL,4,NRSV,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,some began to spit on him to blindfold him and to strike him saying to him prophesy the guards also took him over and beat him,1
6039,GAL,4,NRSV,what has become of the goodwill you felt,then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven,1
6040,GAL,4,NRSV,for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery,1
6041,GAL,4,NRSV,have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth,every generous act of giving with every perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change,1
6042,GAL,4,NRSV,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,he considered the fact that god is able even to raise someone from the deadand figuratively speaking he did receive him back,1
6043,GAL,4,NRSV,it is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times and not only when i am present with you,then he began to say to them today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,1
6044,GAL,4,NRSV,my little children for whom i am again in the pain of childbirth until christ is formed in you i wish i were present with you now and could change my tone for i am perplexed about you,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring,1
6045,GAL,4,NRSV,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1
6046,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman,by faith he left egypt unafraid of the kings anger for he persevered as though he saw him who is invisible,1
6047,GAL,4,NRSV,one the child of the slave was born according to the flesh the other the child of the free woman was born through the promise,i write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life,1
6048,GAL,4,NRSV,now this is an allegory these women are two covenants,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me,1
6049,GAL,4,NRSV,one woman in fact is hagar from mount sinai bearing children for slavery,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me,1
6050,GAL,4,NRSV,now hagar is mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children,for it is from within from the human heart that evil intentions come fornication theft murder adultery avarice wickedness deceit licentiousness envy slander pride folly,1
6051,GAL,4,NRSV,but the other woman corresponds to the jerusalem above she is free and she is our mother,at present however i am going to jerusalem in a ministry to the saints for macedonia and achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at jerusalem,1
6052,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,instead one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and at once blood and water came out,1
6053,GAL,4,NRSV,now you my friends are children of the promise like isaac,for several days he was with the disciples in damascus and immediately he began to proclaim jesus in the synagogues saying he is the son of god,1
6054,GAL,4,NRSV,but just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the spirit so it is now also,for all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass,1
6055,GAL,4,NRSV,but what does the scripture say,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1
6056,GAL,4,NRSV,drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman,so he divided his property between them,1
6057,GAL,4,NRSV,so then friends we are children not of the slave but of the free woman,on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment,1
6058,GAL,5,NRSV,for freedom christ has set us free,so also our beloved brother paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him speaking of this as he does in all his letters,1
6059,GAL,5,NRSV,stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,1
6060,GAL,5,NRSV,listen i paul am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you,then they all shouted out together away with this fellow release barabbas for us this was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city and for murder pilate wanting to release jesus addressed them again but they kept shouting crucify crucify him a third time he said to them why what evil has he done,1
6061,GAL,5,NRSV,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law,they were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes,1
6062,GAL,5,NRSV,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace,with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah that says you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive,1
6063,GAL,5,NRSV,for through the spirit by faith we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness,the nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,1
6064,GAL,5,NRSV,for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything the only thing that counts is faith working through love,they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate in their presence,1
6065,GAL,5,NRSV,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,the glory that you have given me i have given them so that they may be one as we are one i in them and you in me that they may become completely one so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me,1
6066,GAL,5,NRSV,such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you,and all of them were amazed,1
6067,GAL,5,NRSV,a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,go therefore into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet,1
6068,GAL,5,NRSV,i am confident about you in the lord that you will not think otherwise,but in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is,1
6069,GAL,5,NRSV,but whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty,as he was now approaching the path down from the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise god joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen saying blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven some of the pharisees in the crowd said to him teacher order your disciples to stop,1
6070,GAL,5,NRSV,but my friends why am i still being persecuted if i am still preaching circumcision,what then is to be done,1
6071,GAL,5,NRSV,in that case the offense of the cross has been removed,while he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven suddenly two men in white robes stood by them,1
6072,GAL,5,NRSV,i wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves for you were called to freedom brothers and sisters only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for selfindulgence but through love become slaves to one another,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught,1
6073,GAL,5,NRSV,for the whole law is summed up in a single commandment you shall love your neighbor as yourself,so then he who marries his fiancee does well and he who refrains from marriage will do better,1
6074,GAL,5,NRSV,if however you bite and devour one another take care that you are not consumed by one another,immediately while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders,1
6075,GAL,5,NRSV,live by the spirit i say and do not gratify the desires of the flesh,these people however are like irrational animals mere creatures of instinct born to be caught and killed,1
6076,GAL,5,NRSV,for what the flesh desires is opposed to the spirit and what the spirit desires is opposed to the flesh for these are opposed to each other to prevent you from doing what you want,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them,1
6077,GAL,5,NRSV,but if you are led by the spirit you are not subject to the law,when the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy and he fell on the ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth,1
6078,GAL,5,NRSV,now the works of the flesh are obvious fornication impurity licentiousness idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousy anger quarrels dissensions factions envy drunkenness carousing and things like these,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become,1
6079,GAL,5,NRSV,i am warning you as i warned you before those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god,this is my message for you,1
6080,GAL,5,NRSV,by contrast the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness generosity faithfulness gentleness and selfcontrol,but if that wicked slave says to himself my master is delayed and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know,1
6081,GAL,5,NRSV,there is no law against such things,i will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her,1
6082,GAL,5,NRSV,and those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son,1
6083,GAL,5,NRSV,if we live by the spirit let us also be guided by the spirit,whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of god whoever serves must do so with the strength that god supplies so that god may be glorified in all things through jesus christ,1
6084,GAL,5,NRSV,let us not become conceited competing against one another envying one another,resist the devil and he will flee from you,1
6085,GAL,6,NRSV,my friends if anyone is detected in a transgression you who have received the spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness,so keep up your courage men for i have faith in god that it will be exactly as i have been told,1
6086,GAL,6,NRSV,take care that you yourselves are not tempted,and when jesus had been baptized just as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him,1
6087,GAL,6,NRSV,bear one anothers burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ,but someone will ask how are the dead raised,1
6088,GAL,6,NRSV,for if those who are nothing think they are something they deceive themselves,you were bought with a price do not become slaves of human masters,1
6089,GAL,6,NRSV,all must test their own work then that work rather than their neighbors work will become a cause for pride,when the believers learned of it they brought him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus,1
6090,GAL,6,NRSV,for all must carry their own loads,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him,1
6091,GAL,6,NRSV,those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened,1
6092,GAL,6,NRSV,do not be deceived god is not mocked for you reap whatever you sow,he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the pit and locked and sealed it over him so that he would deceive the nations no more until the thousand years were ended,1
6093,GAL,6,NRSV,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem,1
6094,GAL,6,NRSV,so let us not grow weary in doing what is right for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you,1
6095,GAL,6,NRSV,so then whenever we have an opportunity let us work for the good of all and especially for those of the family of faith,nor is that all something similar happened to rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband our ancestor isaac,1
6096,GAL,6,NRSV,see what large letters i make when i am writing in my own hand it is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcisedonly that they may not be persecuted for the cross of christ,then jesus answered her woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish,1
6097,GAL,6,NRSV,even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh,since he would not be persuaded we remained silent except to say the lords will be done,1
6098,GAL,6,NRSV,may i never boast of anything except the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,1
6099,GAL,6,NRSV,for neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything but a new creation is everything as for those who will follow this rulepeace be upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god,when a moderate south wind began to blow they thought they could achieve their purpose so they weighed anchor and began to sail past crete close to the shore,1
6100,GAL,6,NRSV,from now on let no one make trouble for me for i carry the marks of jesus branded on my body,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,1
6101,GAL,6,NRSV,may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers and sisters,yet even if i do judge my judgment is valid for it is not i alone who judge but i and the father who sent me,1
6102,EPH,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god to the saints who are in ephesus and are faithful in christ jesus grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,but to the rest of you in thyatira who do not hold this teaching who have not learned what some call the deep things of satan to you i say i do not lay on you any other burden only hold fast to what you have until i come,1
6103,EPH,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us in christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places just as he chose us in christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love,come to him a living stone though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in gods sight and like living stones let yourselves be built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ,1
6104,EPH,1,NRSV,he destined us for adoption as his children through jesus christ according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the beloved,and baptism which this prefigured now saves younot as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to god for a good conscience through the resurrection of jesus christ who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god with angels authorities and powers made subject to him,1
6105,EPH,1,NRSV,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,now if i am in the wrong and have committed something for which i deserve to die i am not trying to escape death but if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can turn me over to them,1
6106,EPH,1,NRSV,with all wisdom and insight he has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure that he set forth in christ as a plan for the fullness of time to gather up all things in him things in heaven and things on earth,others were saying these are not the words of one who has a demon,1
6107,EPH,1,NRSV,in christ we have also obtained an inheritance having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will so that we who were the first to set our hope on christ might live for the praise of his glory,do i say this on human authority,1
6108,EPH,1,NRSV,in him you also when you had heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and had believed in him were marked with the seal of the promised holy spirit this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as gods own people to the praise of his glory,but peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves then he went home amazed at what had happened,1
6109,EPH,1,NRSV,i have heard of your faith in the lord jesus and your love toward all the saints and for this reason i do not cease to give thanks for you as i remember you in my prayers,anyone who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses,1
6110,EPH,1,NRSV,i pray that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him so that with the eyes of your heart enlightened you may know what is the hope to which he has called you what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe according to the working of his great power,but filled with the holy spirit he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god,1
6111,EPH,1,NRSV,god put this power to work in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is named not only in this age but also in the age to come,when he opened the sixth seal i looked and there came a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale,1
6112,EPH,1,NRSV,and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all,i was in the spirit on the lords day and i heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches to ephesus to smyrna to pergamum to thyatira to sardis to philadelphia and to laodicea,1
6113,EPH,2,NRSV,you were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived following the course of this world following the ruler of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod had married her,1
6114,EPH,2,NRSV,all of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh following the desires of flesh and senses and we were by nature children of wrath like everyone else,so i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may dwell in me,1
6115,EPH,2,NRSV,but god who is rich in mercy out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him,1
6116,EPH,2,NRSV,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast,they came to jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind the very man who had had the legion and they were afraid,1
6117,EPH,2,NRSV,for we are what he has made us created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand to be our way of life,then paul answered what are you doing weeping and breaking my heart,1
6118,EPH,2,NRSV,so then remember that at one time you gentiles by birth called the uncircumcision by those who are called the circumcisiona physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands remember that you were at that time without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers to the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love,1
6119,EPH,2,NRSV,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb,1
6120,EPH,2,NRSV,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us,he had come to jerusalem to worship and was returning home seated in his chariot he was reading the prophet isaiah,1
6121,EPH,2,NRSV,he has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two thus making peace and might reconcile both groups to god in one body through the cross thus putting to death that hostility through it,and we are ready to do away with him before he arrives,1
6122,EPH,2,NRSV,so he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near for through him both of us have access in one spirit to the father,for it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things and your father knows that you need them,1
6123,EPH,2,NRSV,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,1
6124,EPH,2,NRSV,in him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for god,after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them,1
6125,EPH,3,NRSV,this is the reason that i paul am a prisoner for christ jesus for the sake of you gentiles for surely you have already heard of the commission of gods grace that was given me for you and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation as i wrote above in a few words a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of christ,john answered master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us,1
6126,EPH,3,NRSV,in former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that is the gentiles have become fellow heirs members of the same body and sharers in the promise in christ jesus through the gospel,but in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year,1
6127,EPH,3,NRSV,of this gospel i have become a servant according to the gift of gods grace that was given me by the working of his power,for it is obvious to all who live in jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them we cannot deny it,1
6128,EPH,3,NRSV,although i am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to me to bring to the gentiles the news of the boundless riches of christ and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in god who created all things so that through the church the wisdom of god in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places,but if all prophesy an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all,1
6129,EPH,3,NRSV,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him,then he called the crowd to him and said to them listen and understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles,1
6130,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray therefore that you may not lose heart over my sufferings for you they are your glory,judas not iscariot said to him lord how is it that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world,1
6131,EPH,3,NRSV,for this reason i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name,or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered,1
6132,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love,he then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away,1
6133,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray that you may have the power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralytic i say to you stand up take your mat and go to your home,1
6134,EPH,3,NRSV,now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations forever and ever,there is on the one hand the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual for the law made nothing perfect there is on the other hand the introduction of a better hope through which we approach god,1
6135,EPH,4,NRSV,i therefore the prisoner in the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,do you not know that i have power to release you and power to crucify you,1
6136,EPH,4,NRSV,there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in all,slaves obey your earthly masters in everything not only while being watched and in order to please them but wholeheartedly fearing the lord,1
6137,EPH,4,NRSV,but each of us was given grace according to the measure of christs gift,when he entered capernaum a centurion came to him appealing to him and saying lord my servant is lying at home paralyzed in terrible distress,1
6138,EPH,4,NRSV,therefore it is said when he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive he gave gifts to his people,any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head disgraces his head but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved,1
6139,EPH,4,NRSV,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth,in damascus the governor under king aretas guarded the city of damascus in order to seize me but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands,1
6140,EPH,4,NRSV,he who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things the gifts he gave were that some would be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of christ until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to maturity to the measure of the full stature of christ,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory,1
6141,EPH,4,NRSV,we must no longer be children tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine by peoples trickery by their craftiness in deceitful scheming,he stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him,1
6142,EPH,4,NRSV,but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ from whom the whole body joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped as each part is working properly promotes the bodys growth in building itself up in love,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,1
6143,EPH,4,NRSV,now this i affirm and insist on in the lord you must no longer live as the gentiles live in the futility of their minds,no one is good but god alone,1
6144,EPH,4,NRSV,they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of their ignorance and hardness of heart,then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly my little daughter is at the point of death,1
6145,EPH,4,NRSV,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,1
6146,EPH,4,NRSV,that is not the way you learned christ for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus,yes and i will continue to rejoice for i know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ this will turn out for my deliverance,1
6147,EPH,4,NRSV,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1
6148,EPH,4,NRSV,so then putting away falsehood let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors for we are members of one another,it was one of them their very own prophet who said cretans are always liars vicious brutes lazy gluttons,1
6149,EPH,4,NRSV,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,and so it was that all were brought safely to land,1
6150,EPH,4,NRSV,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty,1
6151,EPH,4,NRSV,let no evil talk come out of your mouths but only what is useful for building up as there is need so that your words may give grace to those who hear,i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me,1
6152,EPH,4,NRSV,and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption,over these the second death has no power but they will be priests of god and of christ and they will reign with him a thousand years,1
6153,EPH,4,NRSV,put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander together with all malice and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ has forgiven you,he would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating and no one gave him anything,1
6154,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore be imitators of god as beloved children and live in love as christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god,when they arrived they called the church together and related all that god had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles,1
6155,EPH,5,NRSV,but fornication and impurity of any kind or greed must not even be mentioned among you as is proper among saints,they said where did this man get all this,1
6156,EPH,5,NRSV,entirely out of place is obscene silly and vulgar talk but instead let there be thanksgiving,and when the chief priests and the scribes heard it they kept looking for a way to kill him for they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching,1
6157,EPH,5,NRSV,be sure of this that no fornicator or impure person or one who is greedy that is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god,that same day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea,1
6158,EPH,5,NRSV,let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god comes on those who are disobedient,while they were perplexed about this suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them,1
6159,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore do not be associated with them,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones,1
6160,EPH,5,NRSV,for once you were darkness but now in the lord you are light,put things in order listen to my appeal agree with one another live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you,1
6161,EPH,5,NRSV,live as children of light for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god,1
6162,EPH,5,NRSV,try to find out what is pleasing to the lord,while you preach against stealing do you steal,1
6163,EPH,5,NRSV,take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness but instead expose them,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ,1
6164,EPH,5,NRSV,for it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly but everything exposed by the light becomes visible for everything that becomes visible is light,those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of them the son of man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels,1
6165,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore it says sleeper awake rise from the dead and christ will shine on you,but overhearing what they said jesus said to the leader of the synagogue do not fear only believe,1
6166,EPH,5,NRSV,be careful then how you live not as unwise people but as wise making the most of the time because the days are evil,and crowds again gathered around him and as was his custom he again taught them,1
6167,EPH,5,NRSV,so do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is,in the fifteenth year of the reign of emperor tiberius when pontius pilate was governor of judea and herod was ruler of galilee and his brother philip ruler of the region of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias ruler of abilene during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came to john son of zechariah in the wilderness,1
6168,EPH,5,NRSV,do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery but be filled with the spirit as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves singing and making melody to the lord in your hearts giving thanks to god the father at all times and for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened,1
6169,EPH,5,NRSV,be subject to one another out of reverence for christ,yet i am not alone because the father is with me,1
6170,EPH,5,NRSV,wives be subject to your husbands as you are to the lord,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,1
6171,EPH,5,NRSV,for the husband is the head of the wife just as christ is the head of the church the body of which he is the savior,the sadducees say that there is no resurrection or angel or spirit but the pharisees acknowledge all three then a great clamor arose and certain scribes of the pharisees group stood up and contended we find nothing wrong with this man,1
6172,EPH,5,NRSV,just as the church is subject to christ so also wives ought to be in everything to their husbands,and all in the crowd were trying to touch him for power came out from him and healed all of them,1
6173,EPH,5,NRSV,husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word so as to present the church to himself in splendor without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kindyes so that she may be holy and without blemish,he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he gives the spirit without measure,1
6174,EPH,5,NRSV,in the same way husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies,then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me,1
6175,EPH,5,NRSV,he who loves his wife loves himself,if however you bite and devour one another take care that you are not consumed by one another,1
6176,EPH,5,NRSV,for no one ever hates his own body but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it just as christ does for the church because we are members of his body,indeed the body does not consist of one member but of many,1
6177,EPH,5,NRSV,for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh,i die every day that is as certain brothers and sisters as my boasting of youa boast that i make in christ jesus our lord,1
6178,EPH,5,NRSV,this is a great mystery and i am applying it to christ and the church,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith,1
6179,EPH,5,NRSV,each of you however should love his wife as himself and a wife should respect her husband,for just as the sufferings of christ are abundant for us so also our consolation is abundant through christ,1
6180,EPH,6,NRSV,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right,then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named saul,1
6181,EPH,6,NRSV,honor your father and motherthis is the first commandment with a promise so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth,so they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest in order to trap him by what he said so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor,1
6182,EPH,6,NRSV,and fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord,the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god,1
6183,EPH,6,NRSV,slaves obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as you obey christ not only while being watched and in order to please them but as slaves of christ doing the will of god from the heart,or is it only barnabas and i who have no right to refrain from working for a living,1
6184,EPH,6,NRSV,render service with enthusiasm as to the lord and not to men and women knowing that whatever good we do we will receive the same again from the lord whether we are slaves or free,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage,1
6185,EPH,6,NRSV,and masters do the same to them,indeed so terrifying was the sight that moses said i tremble with fear but you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel,1
6186,EPH,6,NRSV,stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality,bring me a denarius and let me see it,1
6187,EPH,6,NRSV,finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his power,do not move about from house to house,1
6188,EPH,6,NRSV,put on the whole armor of god so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,let anyone accept this who can,1
6189,EPH,6,NRSV,for our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers of this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction and there are many who take it,1
6190,EPH,6,NRSV,therefore take up the whole armor of god so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day and having done everything to stand firm,so it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness,1
6191,EPH,6,NRSV,stand therefore and fasten the belt of truth around your waist and put on the breastplate of righteousness,but jesus said someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me,1
6192,EPH,6,NRSV,as shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace,when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised god and said certainly this man was innocent,1
6193,EPH,6,NRSV,with all of these take the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one,for with the judgment you make you will be judged and the measure you give will be the measure you get,1
6194,EPH,6,NRSV,take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god,for christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes,1
6195,EPH,6,NRSV,pray in the spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication,some were saying john the baptizer has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him,1
6196,EPH,6,NRSV,to that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise none of the seven left children,1
6197,EPH,6,NRSV,pray also for me so that when i speak a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves,1
6198,EPH,6,NRSV,pray that i may declare it boldly as i must speak,later the other bridesmaids came also saying lord lord open to us,1
6199,EPH,6,NRSV,so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing tychicus will tell you everything,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter,1
6200,EPH,6,NRSV,he is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the lord,then the high priest tore his clothes and said why do we still need witnesses,1
6201,EPH,6,NRSV,i am sending him to you for this very purpose to let you know how we are and to encourage your hearts,and he thought to himself what should i do for i have no place to store my crops,1
6202,EPH,6,NRSV,peace be to the whole community and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ,very truly i tell you the one who believes in me will also do the works that i do and in fact will do greater works than these because i am going to the father,1
6203,EPH,6,NRSV,grace be with all who have an undying love for our lord jesus christ,for if a woman will not veil herself then she should cut off her hair but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved she should wear a veil,1
6204,PHP,1,NRSV,paul and timothy servants of christ jesus to all the saints in christ jesus who are in philippi with the bishops and deacons grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer,1
6205,PHP,1,NRSV,i thank my god every time i remember you constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now,and you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children my child do not regard lightly the discipline of the lord or lose heart when you are punished by him for the lord disciplines those whom he loves and chastises every child whom he accepts,1
6206,PHP,1,NRSV,i am confident of this that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of jesus christ,yet this is to your credit you hate the works of the nicolaitans which i also hate,1
6207,PHP,1,NRSV,it is right for me to think this way about all of you because you hold me in your heart for all of you share in gods grace with me both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,instead strive for his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well,1
6208,PHP,1,NRSV,for god is my witness how i long for all of you with the compassion of christ jesus,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven,1
6209,PHP,1,NRSV,and this is my prayer that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best so that in the day of christ you may be pure and blameless having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through jesus christ for the glory and praise of god,then each one will receive commendation from god,1
6210,PHP,1,NRSV,i want you to know beloved that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for christ and most of the brothers and sisters having been made confident in the lord by my imprisonment dare to speak the word with greater boldness and without fear,look i have set before you an open door which no one is able to shut,1
6211,PHP,1,NRSV,some proclaim christ from envy and rivalry but others from goodwill,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption,1
6212,PHP,1,NRSV,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment,then one of the twelve who was called judas iscariot went to the chief priests and said what will you give me if i betray him to you,1
6213,PHP,1,NRSV,just this that christ is proclaimed in every way whether out of false motives or true and in that i rejoice,but herod the ruler who had been rebuked by him because of herodias his brothers wife and because of all the evil things that herod had done added to them all by shutting up john in prison,1
6214,PHP,1,NRSV,yes and i will continue to rejoice for i know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ this will turn out for my deliverance,for such boasters are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ,1
6215,PHP,1,NRSV,it is my eager expectation and hope that i will not be put to shame in any way but that by my speaking with all boldness christ will be exalted now as always in my body whether by life or by death,you were bought with a price do not become slaves of human masters,1
6216,PHP,1,NRSV,for to me living is christ and dying is gain,and the seven for the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect,1
6217,PHP,1,NRSV,if i am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me and i do not know which i prefer,since therefore it remains open for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience again he sets a certain daytodaysaying through david much later in the words already quoted today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts,1
6218,PHP,1,NRSV,i am hard pressed between the two my desire is to depart and be with christ for that is far better but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you,and now i commend you to god and to the message of his grace a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified,1
6219,PHP,1,NRSV,since i am convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith so that i may share abundantly in your boasting in christ jesus when i come to you again,thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god,1
6220,PHP,1,NRSV,only live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come and see you or am absent and hear about you i will know that you are standing firm in one spirit striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel and are in no way intimidated by your opponents,i write to you children because you know the father,1
6221,PHP,1,NRSV,for them this is evidence of their destruction but of your salvation,as he approached the gate of the town a man who had died was being carried out,1
6222,PHP,1,NRSV,for he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in christ but of suffering for him as well since you are having the same struggle that you saw i had and now hear that i still have,so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him because he was going to pass that way,1
6223,PHP,2,NRSV,if then there is any encouragement in christ any consolation from love any sharing in the spirit any compassion and sympathy make my joy complete be of the same mind having the same love being in full accord and of one mind,then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean,1
6224,PHP,2,NRSV,do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit but in humility regard others as better than yourselves,but they said what is that to us,1
6225,PHP,2,NRSV,let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others,he has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins,1
6226,PHP,2,NRSV,let the same mind be in you that was in christ jesus who though he was in the form of god did not regard equality with god as something to be exploited but emptied himself taking the form of a slave being born in human likeness,you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,1
6227,PHP,2,NRSV,and being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death even death on a cross,for if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment and if he did not spare the ancient world even though he saved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly and if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly and if he rescued lot a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust and who despise authority,1
6228,PHP,2,NRSV,therefore god also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bend in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest,1
6229,PHP,2,NRSV,therefore my beloved just as you have always obeyed me not only in my presence but much more now in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who is at work in you enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure,he will turn many of the people of israel to the lord their god,1
6230,PHP,2,NRSV,do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world,we do not boast beyond limits that is in the labors of others but our hope is that as your faith increases our sphere of action among you may be greatly enlarged so that we may proclaim the good news in lands beyond you without boasting of work already done in someone elses sphere of action,1
6231,PHP,2,NRSV,it is by your holding fast to the word of life that i can boast on the day of christ that i did not run in vain or labor in vain,jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me,1
6232,PHP,2,NRSV,but even if i am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me,after he had said this he took bread and giving thanks to god in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat,1
6233,PHP,2,NRSV,i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon so that i may be cheered by news of you,every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god,1
6234,PHP,2,NRSV,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare,so if you have been raised with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god,1
6235,PHP,2,NRSV,all of them are seeking their own interests not those of jesus christ,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them,1
6236,PHP,2,NRSV,but timothys worth you know how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1
6237,PHP,2,NRSV,i hope therefore to send him as soon as i see how things go with me and i trust in the lord that i will also come soon,many came to him and they were saying john performed no sign but everything that john said about this man was true,1
6238,PHP,2,NRSV,still i think it necessary to send to you epaphroditusmy brother and coworker and fellow soldier your messenger and minister to my need for he has been longing for all of you and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill,six days before the passover jesus came to bethany the home of lazarus whom he had raised from the dead,1
6239,PHP,2,NRSV,he was indeed so ill that he nearly died,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened,1
6240,PHP,2,NRSV,but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me also so that i would not have one sorrow after another,for not all israelites truly belong to israel and not all of abrahams children are his true descendants but it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you,1
6241,PHP,2,NRSV,i am the more eager to send him therefore in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again and that i may be less anxious,blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god,1
6242,PHP,2,NRSV,welcome him then in the lord with all joy and honor such people because he came close to death for the work of christ risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,1
6243,PHP,3,NRSV,finally my brothers and sisters rejoice in the lord,for he had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit then jesus asked him what is your name,1
6244,PHP,3,NRSV,to write the same things to you is not troublesome to me and for you it is a safeguard,this took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion look your king is coming to you humble and mounted on a donkey and on a colt the foal of a donkey,1
6245,PHP,3,NRSV,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,1
6246,PHP,3,NRSV,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,jesus said to them fill the jars with water,1
6247,PHP,3,NRSV,yet whatever gains i had these i have come to regard as loss because of christ,but only speak the word and let my servant be healed,1
6248,PHP,3,NRSV,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,1
6249,PHP,3,NRSV,for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and i regard them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but one that comes through faith in christ the righteousness from god based on faith,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,1
6250,PHP,3,NRSV,i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not,1
6251,PHP,3,NRSV,not that i have already obtained this or have already reached the goal but i press on to make it my own because christ jesus has made me his own,the tribune answered it cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship,1
6252,PHP,3,NRSV,beloved i do not consider that i have made it my own but this one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead i press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of god in christ jesus,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1
6253,PHP,3,NRSV,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,1
6254,PHP,3,NRSV,only let us hold fast to what we have attained,all this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet look the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall name him emmanuel which means god is with us,1
6255,PHP,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters join in imitating me and observe those who live according to the example you have in us,but with whom was he angry forty years,1
6256,PHP,3,NRSV,for many live as enemies of the cross of christ i have often told you of them and now i tell you even with tears,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god,1
6257,PHP,3,NRSV,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling,1
6258,PHP,3,NRSV,but our citizenship is in heaven and it is from there that we are expecting a savior the lord jesus christ,he was a devout man who feared god with all his household he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to god,1
6259,PHP,3,NRSV,he will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist,1
6260,PHP,4,NRSV,therefore my brothers and sisters whom i love and long for my joy and crown stand firm in the lord in this way my beloved,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,1
6261,PHP,4,NRSV,i urge euodia and i urge syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord,these he gathered together with the workers of the same trade and said men you know that we get our wealth from this business,1
6262,PHP,4,NRSV,yes and i ask you also my loyal companion help these women for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel together with clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them and all of them drank from it,1
6263,PHP,4,NRSV,rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice,then he set sail from ephesus,1
6264,PHP,4,NRSV,let your gentleness be known to everyone,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach,1
6265,PHP,4,NRSV,do not worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god,and we have confidence in the lord concerning you that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command,1
6266,PHP,4,NRSV,and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast,1
6267,PHP,4,NRSV,finally beloved whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever is commendable if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things,he was accompanied by sopater son of pyrrhus from beroea by aristarchus and secundus from thessalonica by gaius from derbe and by timothy as well as by tychicus and trophimus from asia,1
6268,PHP,4,NRSV,keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and the god of peace will be with you,when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey and all of them with wives and children escorted us outside the city,1
6269,PHP,4,NRSV,i rejoice in the lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me indeed you were concerned for me but had no opportunity to show it,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me,1
6270,PHP,4,NRSV,not that i am referring to being in need for i have learned to be content with whatever i have,remember jesus christ raised from the dead a descendant of davidthat is my gospel for which i suffer hardship even to the point of being chained like a criminal,1
6271,PHP,4,NRSV,i know what it is to have little and i know what it is to have plenty,when you come together each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation,1
6272,PHP,4,NRSV,in any and all circumstances i have learned the secret of being wellfed and of going hungry of having plenty and of being in need,avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith,1
6273,PHP,4,NRSV,i can do all things through him who strengthens me,they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day,1
6274,PHP,4,NRSV,in any case it was kind of you to share my distress,if you loved me you would rejoice that i am going to the father because the father is greater than i,1
6275,PHP,4,NRSV,you philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel when i left macedonia no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone,then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore,1
6276,PHP,4,NRSV,for even when i was in thessalonica you sent me help for my needs more than once,mary said to the angel how can this be since i am a virgin,1
6277,PHP,4,NRSV,not that i seek the gift but i seek the profit that accumulates to your account,therefore my dear friends flee from the worship of idols,1
6278,PHP,4,NRSV,i have been paid in full and have more than enough i am fully satisfied now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to god,there are some things in them hard to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures,1
6279,PHP,4,NRSV,and my god will fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory in christ jesus,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself,1
6280,PHP,4,NRSV,to our god and father be glory forever and ever,but he said to them the kings of the gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors,1
6281,PHP,4,NRSV,greet every saint in christ jesus,but the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart a good conscience and sincere faith,1
6282,PHP,4,NRSV,the friends who are with me greet you,he denied it and said i am not,1
6283,PHP,4,NRSV,all the saints greet you especially those of the emperors household,some were saying it is he,1
6284,PHP,4,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit,but you say that if anyone tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is corban that is an offering to god then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother thus making void the word of god through your tradition that you have handed on,1
6285,COL,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in christ in colossae grace to you and peace from god our father,timothy my coworker greets you so do lucius and jason and sosipater my relatives,1
6286,COL,1,NRSV,in our prayers for you we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ for we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints because of the hope laid up for you in heaven,in the morning they did not recognize the land but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if they could,1
6287,COL,1,NRSV,you have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth the gospel that has come to you,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god,1
6288,COL,1,NRSV,just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of god,jesus answered him very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above,1
6289,COL,1,NRSV,this you learned from epaphras our beloved fellow servant,around the throne are twentyfour thrones and seated on the thrones are twentyfour elders dressed in white robes with golden crowns on their heads,1
6290,COL,1,NRSV,he is a faithful minister of christ on your behalf and he has made known to us your love in the spirit,again truly i tell you if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven,1
6291,COL,1,NRSV,for this reason since the day we heard it we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of gods will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding so that you may lead lives worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of god,one of his disciplesthe one whom jesus lovedwas reclining next to him simon peter therefore motioned to him to ask jesus of whom he was speaking,1
6292,COL,1,NRSV,may you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience while joyfully giving thanks to the father who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light,see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals,1
6293,COL,1,NRSV,he has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,1
6294,COL,1,NRSV,he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created things visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powersall things have been created through him and for him,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it,1
6295,COL,1,NRSV,he himself is before all things and in him all things hold together,but the jews became jealous and with the help of some ruffians in the marketplaces they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar,1
6296,COL,1,NRSV,he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might come to have first place in everything,early in the morning he came again to the temple,1
6297,COL,1,NRSV,for in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him god was pleased to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven by making peace through the blood of his cross,and once more he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they did not know what to say to him,1
6298,COL,1,NRSV,and you who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called cyrenians alexandrians and others of those from cilicia and asia stood up and argued with stephen,1
6299,COL,1,NRSV,i paul became a servant of this gospel,then the angel showed me the river of the water of life bright as crystal flowing from the throne of god and of the lamb through the middle of the street of the city,1
6300,COL,1,NRSV,i am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh i am completing what is lacking in christs afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ,1
6301,COL,1,NRSV,i became its servant according to gods commission that was given to me for you to make the word of god fully known the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints,now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due,1
6302,COL,1,NRSV,to them god chose to make known how great among the gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory,so they are no longer two but one flesh,1
6303,COL,1,NRSV,it is he whom we proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom so that we may present everyone mature in christ,and remember i am with you always to the end of the age,1
6304,COL,1,NRSV,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me,in this you rejoice even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more precious than gold that though perishable is tested by firemay be found to result in praise and glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed,1
6305,COL,2,NRSV,for i want you to know how much i am struggling for you and for those in laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them,1
6306,COL,2,NRSV,i want their hearts to be encouraged and united in love so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding and have the knowledge of gods mystery that is christ himself in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life,1
6307,COL,2,NRSV,i am saying this so that no one may deceive you with plausible arguments,certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law,1
6308,COL,2,NRSV,for though i am absent in body yet i am with you in spirit and i rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in christ,and a man lame from birth was being carried in,1
6309,COL,2,NRSV,as you therefore have received christ jesus the lord continue to live your lives in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith just as you were taught abounding in thanksgiving,and jesus got up and followed him with his disciples,1
6310,COL,2,NRSV,see to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition according to the elemental spirits of the universe and not according to christ,the foolish said to the wise give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out,1
6311,COL,2,NRSV,for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily and you have come to fullness in him who is the head of every ruler and authority,when he saw jesus he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god,1
6312,COL,2,NRSV,in him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ when you were buried with him in baptism you were also raised with him through faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead,or are you envious because i am generous,1
6313,COL,2,NRSV,and when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god made you alive together with him when he forgave us all our trespasses erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands,but the one who endures to the end will be saved,1
6314,COL,2,NRSV,he set this aside nailing it to the cross,fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses,1
6315,COL,2,NRSV,he disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them triumphing over them in it,then she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up,1
6316,COL,2,NRSV,therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals new moons or sabbaths,so after they had gathered pilate said to them whom do you want me to release for you jesus barabbas or jesus who is called the messiah,1
6317,COL,2,NRSV,these are only a shadow of what is to come but the substance belongs to christ,husband for all you know you might save your wife,1
6318,COL,2,NRSV,do not let anyone disqualify you insisting on selfabasement and worship of angels dwelling on visions puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking and not holding fast to the head from whom the whole body nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows with a growth that is from god,but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what he had done,1
6319,COL,2,NRSV,if with christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe why do you live as if you still belonged to the world,or if the child asks for an egg will give a scorpion,1
6320,COL,2,NRSV,why do you submit to regulations do not handle do not taste do not touch,up to this point they listened to him but then they shouted away with such a fellow from the earth for he should not be allowed to live,1
6321,COL,2,NRSV,all these regulations refer to things that perish with use they are simply human commands and teachings,then he ordered that he be kept under guard in herods headquarters,1
6322,COL,2,NRSV,these have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting selfimposed piety humility and severe treatment of the body but they are of no value in checking selfindulgence,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,1
6323,COL,3,NRSV,so if you have been raised with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words,1
6324,COL,3,NRSV,set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god,it was fitting that god for whom and through whom all things exist in bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings,1
6325,COL,3,NRSV,when christ who is your life is revealed then you also will be revealed with him in glory,you have been born anew not of perishable but of imperishable seed through the living and enduring word of god,1
6326,COL,3,NRSV,put to death therefore whatever in you is earthly fornication impurity passion evil desire and greed which is idolatry,while they were stoning stephen he prayed lord jesus receive my spirit,1
6327,COL,3,NRSV,on account of these the wrath of god is coming on those who are disobedient,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness,1
6328,COL,3,NRSV,these are the ways you also once followed when you were living that life,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer,1
6329,COL,3,NRSV,but now you must get rid of all such thingsanger wrath malice slander and abusive language from your mouth,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another,1
6330,COL,3,NRSV,do not lie to one another seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator,but he was speaking of the temple of his body,1
6331,COL,3,NRSV,in that renewal there is no longer greek and jew circumcised and uncircumcised barbarian scythian slave and free but christ is all and in all as gods chosen ones holy and beloved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility meekness and patience,rise let us be on our way,1
6332,COL,3,NRSV,bear with one another and if anyone has a complaint against another forgive each other just as the lord has forgiven you so you also must forgive,from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain,1
6333,COL,3,NRSV,above all clothe yourselves with love which binds everything together in perfect harmony,in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven,1
6334,COL,3,NRSV,and let the peace of christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called in the one body,and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of dalmanutha,1
6335,COL,3,NRSV,let the word of christ dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs to god,after that no one dared to ask him any question,1
6336,COL,3,NRSV,and whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,1
6337,COL,3,NRSV,wives be subject to your husbands as is fitting in the lord,as the sun was setting all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them,1
6338,COL,3,NRSV,husbands love your wives and never treat them harshly,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain,1
6339,COL,3,NRSV,children obey your parents in everything for this is your acceptable duty in the lord,then another angel a second followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,1
6340,COL,3,NRSV,fathers do not provoke your children or they may lose heart,greet also the church in their house,1
6341,COL,3,NRSV,slaves obey your earthly masters in everything not only while being watched and in order to please them but wholeheartedly fearing the lord,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,1
6342,COL,3,NRSV,whatever your task put yourselves into it as done for the lord and not for your masters since you know that from the lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you serve the lord christ,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,1
6343,COL,3,NRSV,for the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done and there is no partiality,as to his raising him from the dead no more to return to corruption he has spoken in this way i will give you the holy promises made to david,1
6344,COL,4,NRSV,masters treat your slaves justly and fairly for you know that you also have a master in heaven,after jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples across the kidron valley to a place where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered,1
6345,COL,4,NRSV,devote yourselves to prayer keeping alert in it with thanksgiving,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,1
6346,COL,4,NRSV,at the same time pray for us as well that god will open to us a door for the word that we may declare the mystery of christ for which i am in prison so that i may reveal it clearly as i should,they put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head,1
6347,COL,4,NRSV,conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders making the most of the time,as soon as he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john whose other name was mark where many had gathered and were praying,1
6348,COL,4,NRSV,let your speech always be gracious seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone,i john am the one who heard and saw these things,1
6349,COL,4,NRSV,tychicus will tell you all the news about me he is a beloved brother a faithful minister and a fellow servant in the lord,he stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him,1
6350,COL,4,NRSV,i have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts he is coming with onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you,in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood,1
6351,COL,4,NRSV,they will tell you about everything here,thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself observe and guard the law,1
6352,COL,4,NRSV,aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you as does mark the cousin of barnabas concerning whom you have received instructionsif he comes to you welcome him,then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born,1
6353,COL,4,NRSV,and jesus who is called justus greets you,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good,1
6354,COL,4,NRSV,these are the only ones of the circumcision among my coworkers for the kingdom of god and they have been a comfort to me,so the disciples did as jesus had directed them and they prepared the passover meal,1
6355,COL,4,NRSV,epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus greets you,then festus after he had conferred with his council replied you have appealed to the emperor to the emperor you will go,1
6356,COL,4,NRSV,he is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that god wills,but i ask have they not heard,1
6357,COL,4,NRSV,for i testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in laodicea and in hierapolis,render to her as she herself has rendered and repay her double for her deeds mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed,1
6358,COL,4,NRSV,luke the beloved physician and demas greet you,so for the second time they called the man who had been blind and they said to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner,1
6359,COL,4,NRSV,give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in laodicea and to nympha and the church in her house,then he took the twelve aside and said to them see we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written about the son of man by the prophets will be accomplished,1
6360,COL,4,NRSV,and when this letter has been read among you have it read also in the church of the laodiceans and see that you read also the letter from laodicea,greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them,1
6361,COL,4,NRSV,and say to archippus see that you complete the task that you have received in the lord,look there is the place they laid him,1
6362,COL,4,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me,1
6363,1TH,1,NRSV,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace,i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now,1
6364,1TH,1,NRSV,we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ,i tell you among those born of women no one is greater than john yet the least in the kingdom of god is greater than he,1
6365,1TH,1,NRSV,for we know brothers and sisters beloved by god that he has chosen you because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake,greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss,1
6366,1TH,1,NRSV,and you became imitators of us and of the lord for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the holy spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia,they replied the things about jesus of nazareth who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him,1
6367,1TH,1,NRSV,for the word of the lord has sounded forth from you not only in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith in god has become known so that we have no need to speak about it,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish,1
6368,1TH,1,NRSV,for the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you and how you turned to god from idols to serve a living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the deadjesus who rescues us from the wrath that is coming,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham,1
6369,1TH,2,NRSV,you yourselves know brothers and sisters that our coming to you was not in vain but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at philippi as you know we had courage in our god to declare to you the gospel of god in spite of great opposition,they are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor saying that there is another king named jesus,1
6370,1TH,2,NRSV,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone,1
6371,1TH,2,NRSV,as you know and as god is our witness we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed nor did we seek praise from mortals whether from you or from others though we might have made demands as apostles of christ,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they are no more,1
6372,1TH,2,NRSV,but we were gentle among you like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children,on reading the letter he asked what province he belonged to and when he learned that he was from cilicia he said i will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive,1
6373,1TH,2,NRSV,so deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own selves because you have become very dear to us,so one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john until the day when he was taken up from usone of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection,1
6374,1TH,2,NRSV,you remember our labor and toil brothers and sisters we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of god,indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel,1
6375,1TH,2,NRSV,you are witnesses and god also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was toward you believers,all who hate a brother or sister are murderers and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them,1
6376,1TH,2,NRSV,as you know we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of god who calls you into his own kingdom and glory,she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair,1
6377,1TH,2,NRSV,we also constantly give thanks to god for this that when you received the word of god that you heard from us you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is gods word which is also at work in you believers,he went up the mountain and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him,1
6378,1TH,2,NRSV,for you brothers and sisters became imitators of the churches of god in christ jesus that are in judea for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the jews who killed both the lord jesus and the prophets and drove us out they displease god and oppose everyone by hindering us from speaking to the gentiles so that they may be saved,so then brothers and sisters we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live,1
6379,1TH,2,NRSV,thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins but gods wrath has overtaken them at last,he was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light,1
6380,1TH,2,NRSV,as for us brothers and sisters when for a short time we were made orphans by being separated from youin person not in heartwe longed with great eagerness to see you face to face,he answered the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash,1
6381,1TH,2,NRSV,for we wanted to come to youcertainly i paul wanted to again and againbut satan blocked our way,but filled with the holy spirit he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god,1
6382,1TH,2,NRSV,for what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our lord jesus at his coming,but no one can enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man then indeed the house can be plundered,1
6383,1TH,2,NRSV,yes you are our glory and joy,he answered i do not know whether he is a sinner,1
6384,1TH,3,NRSV,therefore when we could bear it no longer we decided to be left alone in athens and we sent timothy our brother and coworker for god in proclaiming the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions,we have four men who are under a vow,1
6385,1TH,3,NRSV,indeed you yourselves know that this is what we are destined for,but paul chose silas and set out the believers commending him to the grace of the lord,1
6386,1TH,3,NRSV,in fact when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution so it turned out as you know,they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman but no one said what do you want,1
6387,1TH,3,NRSV,for this reason when i could bear it no longer i sent to find out about your faith i was afraid that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor had been in vain,but if you call yourself a jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to god and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness a corrector of the foolish a teacher of children having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth you then that teach others will you not teach yourself,1
6388,1TH,3,NRSV,but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought us the good news of your faith and love,here you have what is yours,1
6389,1TH,3,NRSV,he has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see usjust as we long to see you,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and his brother john and led them up a high mountain by themselves,1
6390,1TH,3,NRSV,for this reason brothers and sisters during all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you through your faith,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him,1
6391,1TH,3,NRSV,for we now live if you continue to stand firm in the lord,when he went out about nine oclock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and he said to them you also go into the vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right,1
6392,1TH,3,NRSV,how can we thank god enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our god because of you,i know that you cannot tolerate evildoers you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them to be false,1
6393,1TH,3,NRSV,night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith,let us not become conceited competing against one another envying one another,1
6394,1TH,3,NRSV,now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus direct our way to you,he will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1
6395,1TH,3,NRSV,and may the lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all just as we abound in love for you,jesus answered is it not written in your law i said you are gods,1
6396,1TH,3,NRSV,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints,for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ,1
6397,1TH,4,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters we ask and urge you in the lord jesus that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please god as in fact you are doing you should do so more and more,then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there and he said it is written my house shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers,1
6398,1TH,4,NRSV,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus,through the spirit they told paul not to go on to jerusalem,1
6399,1TH,4,NRSV,for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from fornication that each one of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor not with lustful passion like the gentiles who do not know god that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister in this matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you,he has been raised he is not here,1
6400,1TH,4,NRSV,for god did not call us to impurity but in holiness,after two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and since he wanted to grant the jews a favor felix left paul in prison,1
6401,1TH,4,NRSV,therefore whoever rejects this rejects not human authority but god who also gives his holy spirit to you,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god,1
6402,1TH,4,NRSV,now concerning love of the brothers and sisters you do not need to have anyone write to you for you yourselves have been taught by god to love one another and indeed you do love all the brothers and sisters throughout macedonia,they were greatly astounded and said to one another then who can be saved,1
6403,1TH,4,NRSV,but we urge you beloved to do so more and more to aspire to live quietly to mind your own affairs and to work with your hands as we directed you so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and be dependent on no one,this is a wilderness road so he got up and went,1
6404,1TH,4,NRSV,but we do not want you to be uninformed brothers and sisters about those who have died so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope,this spirit he poured out on us richly through jesus christ our savior so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life,1
6405,1TH,4,NRSV,for since we believe that jesus died and rose again even so through jesus god will bring with him those who have died,he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus,1
6406,1TH,4,NRSV,for this we declare to you by the word of the lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the lord will by no means precede those who have died,wherever they do not welcome you as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them,1
6407,1TH,4,NRSV,for the lord himself with a cry of command with the archangels call and with the sound of gods trumpet will descend from heaven and the dead in christ will rise first,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1
6408,1TH,4,NRSV,then we who are alive who are left will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the lord in the air and so we will be with the lord forever,when they heard this they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching,1
6409,1TH,4,NRSV,therefore encourage one another with these words,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another,1
6410,1TH,5,NRSV,now concerning the times and the seasons brothers and sisters you do not need to have anything written to you,and after it was sold were not the proceeds at your disposal,1
6411,1TH,5,NRSV,for you yourselves know very well that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night,then pilate said to him do you not hear how many accusations they make against you,1
6412,1TH,5,NRSV,when they say there is peace and security then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman and there will be no escape but you beloved are not in darkness for that day to surprise you like a thief for you are all children of light and children of the day we are not of the night or of darkness,and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,1
6413,1TH,5,NRSV,so then let us not fall asleep as others do but let us keep awake and be sober for those who sleep sleep at night and those who are drunk get drunk at night,i pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for christ,1
6414,1TH,5,NRSV,but since we belong to the day let us be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation,whoever knows god listens to us and whoever is not from god does not listen to us,1
6415,1TH,5,NRSV,for god has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our lord jesus christ who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him,i begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not,1
6416,1TH,5,NRSV,therefore encourage one another and build up each other as indeed you are doing,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire,1
6417,1TH,5,NRSV,but we appeal to you brothers and sisters to respect those who labor among you and have charge of you in the lord and admonish you esteem them very highly in love because of their work,truly i tell you wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her,1
6418,1TH,5,NRSV,and we urge you beloved to admonish the idlers encourage the faint hearted help the weak be patient with all of them,just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if it were a matter of crime or serious villainy i would be justified in accepting the complaint of you jews but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters,1
6419,1TH,5,NRSV,see that none of you repays evil for evil but always seek to do good to one another and to all,then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the lord,1
6420,1TH,5,NRSV,rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you,for this very reason you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness and goodness with knowledge and knowledge with selfcontrol and selfcontrol with endurance and endurance with godliness and godliness with mutual affection and mutual affection with love,1
6421,1TH,5,NRSV,do not despise the words of prophets but test everything hold fast to what is good abstain from every form of evil,but some of them said he casts out demons by beelzebul the ruler of the demons,1
6422,1TH,5,NRSV,may the god of peace himself sanctify you entirely and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ,when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect,1
6423,1TH,5,NRSV,the one who calls you is faithful and he will do this,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man,1
6424,1TH,5,NRSV,greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss,while some were saying he is a good man others were saying no he is deceiving the crowd,1
6425,1TH,5,NRSV,i solemnly command you by the lord that this letter be read to all of them,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me,1
6426,1TH,5,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you,he has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see usjust as we long to see you,1
6427,2TH,1,NRSV,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,very truly i tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain but if it dies it bears much fruit,1
6428,2TH,1,NRSV,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing,i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,1
6429,2TH,1,NRSV,therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of god for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring,now concerning love of the brothers and sisters you do not need to have anyone write to you for you yourselves have been taught by god to love one another and indeed you do love all the brothers and sisters throughout macedonia,1
6430,2TH,1,NRSV,this is evidence of the righteous judgment of god and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are also suffering,but each of us was given grace according to the measure of christs gift,1
6431,2TH,1,NRSV,for it is indeed just of god to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus,now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of services but the same lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone,1
6432,2TH,1,NRSV,these will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction separated from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his might when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at on that day among all who have believed because our testimony to you was believed,they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed paul,1
6433,2TH,1,NRSV,to this end we always pray for you asking that our god will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ,but when the pharisees heard it they said it is only by beelzebul the ruler of the demons that this fellow casts out the demons,1
6434,2TH,2,NRSV,as to the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we beg you brothers and sisters not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by spirit or by word or by letter as though from us to the effect that the day of the lord is already here,he said go into the city to a certain man and say to him the teacher says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples,1
6435,2TH,2,NRSV,let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed the one destined for destruction,seven sons of a jewish high priest named sceva were doing this,1
6436,2TH,2,NRSV,he opposes and exalts himself above every socalled god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god declaring himself to be god,my point is this the law which came four hundred thirty years later does not annul a covenant previously ratified by god so as to nullify the promise,1
6437,2TH,2,NRSV,do you not remember that i told you these things when i was still with you,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow,1
6438,2TH,2,NRSV,and you know what is now restraining him so that he may be revealed when his time comes,jesus answered i saw you under the fig tree before philip called you,1
6439,2TH,2,NRSV,for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work but only until the one who now restrains it is removed,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,1
6440,2TH,2,NRSV,and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will destroy with the breath of his mouth annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming,then he left and went to another place,1
6441,2TH,2,NRSV,the coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of satan who uses all power signs lying wonders and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved,i am the vine you are the branches,1
6442,2TH,2,NRSV,for this reason god sends them a powerful delusion leading them to believe what is false so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned,and he said to them what is it you want me to do for you,1
6443,2TH,2,NRSV,but we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters beloved by the lord because god chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and through belief in the truth,and because you are children god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father so you are no longer a slave but a child and if a child then also an heir through god,1
6444,2TH,2,NRSV,for this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news so that you may obtain the glory of our lord jesus christ,then jesus told his disciples if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me,1
6445,2TH,2,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us either by word of mouth or by our letter,after threatening them again they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for all of them praised god for what had happened,1
6446,2TH,2,NRSV,now may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word,whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple,1
6447,2TH,3,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters pray for us so that the word of the lord may spread rapidly and be glorified everywhere just as it is among you and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people for not all have faith,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring,1
6448,2TH,3,NRSV,but the lord is faithful he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,1
6449,2TH,3,NRSV,and we have confidence in the lord concerning you that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,1
6450,2TH,3,NRSV,may the lord direct your hearts to the love of god and to the steadfastness of christ,you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery,1
6451,2TH,3,NRSV,now we command you beloved in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days for there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations and jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled,1
6452,2TH,3,NRSV,for you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us we were not idle when we were with you and we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you,meanwhile the disciples were urging him rabbi eat something,1
6453,2TH,3,NRSV,this was not because we do not have that right but in order to give you an example to imitate,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,1
6454,2TH,3,NRSV,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat,there was not a needy person among them for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold,1
6455,2TH,3,NRSV,for we hear that some of you are living in idleness mere busybodies not doing any work,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me,1
6456,2TH,3,NRSV,now such persons we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man,1
6457,2TH,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,this took place in bethany across the jordan where john was baptizing,1
6458,2TH,3,NRSV,take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter have nothing to do with them so that they may be ashamed,and they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it,1
6459,2TH,3,NRSV,do not regard them as enemies but warn them as believers,then jesus said to his disciples truly i tell you it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven,1
6460,2TH,3,NRSV,now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways,but he passed through the midst of them and went on his way,1
6461,2TH,3,NRSV,the lord be with all of you,when the hour came he took his place at the table and the apostles with him,1
6462,2TH,3,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,1
6463,2TH,3,NRSV,this is the mark in every letter of mine it is the way i write,they said to him he will put those wretches to a miserable death and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time,1
6464,2TH,3,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with all of you,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,1
6465,1TI,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our savior and of christ jesus our hope to timothy my loyal child in the faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord,and they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere while the lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it,1
6466,1TI,1,NRSV,i urge you as i did when i was on my way to macedonia to remain in ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith,then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done to you,1
6467,1TI,1,NRSV,but the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart a good conscience and sincere faith,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,1
6468,1TI,1,NRSV,some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk desiring to be teachers of the law without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions,and to the angel of the church in pergamum write these are the words of him who has the sharp twoedged sword i know where you are living where satans throne is,1
6469,1TI,1,NRSV,now we know that the law is good if one uses it legitimately,while paul was looking intently at the council he said brothers up to this day i have lived my life with a clear conscience before god,1
6470,1TI,1,NRSV,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell,1
6471,1TI,1,NRSV,i am grateful to christ jesus our lord who has strengthened me because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service even though i was formerly a blasphemer a persecutor and a man of violence,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin he condemned sin in the flesh so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit,1
6472,1TI,1,NRSV,but i received mercy because i had acted ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in christ jesus,they killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one and now you have become his betrayers and murderers,1
6473,1TI,1,NRSV,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom i am the foremost,on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go across to the other side,1
6474,1TI,1,NRSV,but for that very reason i received mercy so that in me as the foremost jesus christ might display the utmost patience making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them,1
6475,1TI,1,NRSV,to the king of the ages immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever,i wrote for this reason to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything,1
6476,1TI,1,NRSV,i am giving you these instructions timothy my child in accordance with the prophecies made earlier about you so that by following them you may fight the good fight having faith and a good conscience,what then will the owner of the vineyard do,1
6477,1TI,1,NRSV,by rejecting conscience certain persons have suffered shipwreck in the faith among them are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have turned over to satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme,you are witnesses and god also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was toward you believers,1
6478,1TI,2,NRSV,first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone for kings and all who are in high positions so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god,1
6479,1TI,2,NRSV,this is right and is acceptable in the sight of god our savior who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,1
6480,1TI,2,NRSV,for there is one god there is also one mediator between god and humankind christ jesus himself human who gave himself a ransom for all this was attested at the right time,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans,1
6481,1TI,2,NRSV,for this i was appointed a herald and an apostle i am telling the truth i am not lying a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth,it is no longer good for anything but is thrown out and trampled under foot,1
6482,1TI,2,NRSV,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god,and jesus said you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother also you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1
6483,1TI,2,NRSV,let a woman learn in silence with full submission,at once the man was made well and he took up his mat and began to walk,1
6484,1TI,2,NRSV,i permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man she is to keep silent,therefore i have reached the decision that we should not trouble those gentiles who are turning to god but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood,1
6485,1TI,2,NRSV,for adam was formed first then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor,she was devoted to good works and acts of charity,1
6486,1TI,2,NRSV,yet she will be saved through childbearing provided they continue in faith and love and holiness with modesty,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,1
6487,1TI,3,NRSV,the saying is sure whoever aspires to the office of bishop desires a noble task,and he said bring them here to me,1
6488,1TI,3,NRSV,now a bishop must be above reproach married only once temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side,1
6489,1TI,3,NRSV,he must manage his own household well keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how can he take care of gods church,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner,1
6490,1TI,3,NRSV,he must not be a recent convert or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil,once while jesus was standing beside the lake of gennesaret and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of god he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets,1
6491,1TI,3,NRSV,moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil,i do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith rather we are workers with you for your joy because you stand firm in the faith,1
6492,1TI,3,NRSV,deacons likewise must be serious not doubletongued not indulging in much wine not greedy for money they must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience,also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them,1
6493,1TI,3,NRSV,and let them first be tested then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons,when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god,1
6494,1TI,3,NRSV,women likewise must be serious not slanderers but temperate faithful in all things,he was with the proconsul sergius paulus an intelligent man who summoned barnabas and saul and wanted to hear the word of god,1
6495,1TI,3,NRSV,let deacons be married only once and let them manage their children and their households well for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in christ jesus,martha served and lazarus was one of those at the table with him,1
6496,1TI,3,NRSV,i hope to come to you soon but i am writing these instructions to you so that if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and bulwark of the truth,but even titus who was with me was not compelled to be circumcised though he was a greek,1
6497,1TI,3,NRSV,without any doubt the mystery of our religion is great he was revealed in flesh vindicated in spirit seen by angels proclaimed among gentiles believed in throughout the world taken up in glory,you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly in order to spend what you get on your pleasures,1
6498,1TI,4,NRSV,now the spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron,they said to him lord come and see,1
6499,1TI,4,NRSV,they forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth,to him be the glory forever,1
6500,1TI,4,NRSV,for everything created by god is good and nothing is to be rejected provided it is received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by gods word and by prayer,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers,1
6501,1TI,4,NRSV,if you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters you will be a good servant of christ jesus nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed,for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me,1
6502,1TI,4,NRSV,have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives tales,why then did you not put my money into the bank,1
6503,1TI,4,NRSV,train yourself in godliness for while physical training is of some value godliness is valuable in every way holding promise for both the present life and the life to come,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish,1
6504,1TI,4,NRSV,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance,then he left the crowds and went into the house,1
6505,1TI,4,NRSV,for to this end we toil and struggle because we have our hope set on the living god who is the savior of all people especially of those who believe,he said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you became believers,1
6506,1TI,4,NRSV,these are the things you must insist on and teach,then peter began to speak to them i truly understand that god shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him,1
6507,1TI,4,NRSV,let no one despise your youth but set the believers an example in speech and conduct in love in faith in purity,it was a harbor of crete facing southwest and northwest,1
6508,1TI,4,NRSV,until i arrive give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhorting to teaching,do not lord it over those in your charge but be examples to the flock,1
6509,1TI,4,NRSV,do not neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders,now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the night in prayer to god,1
6510,1TI,4,NRSV,put these things into practice devote yourself to them so that all may see your progress,all the brothers and sisters send greetings,1
6511,1TI,4,NRSV,pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit,1
6512,1TI,5,NRSV,do not speak harshly to an older man but speak to him as to a father to younger men as brothers to older women as mothers to younger women as sisterswith absolute purity,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast on that day,1
6513,1TI,5,NRSV,honor widows who are really widows,do you want to be shown you senseless person that faith apart from works is barren,1
6514,1TI,5,NRSV,if a widow has children or grandchildren they should first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some repayment to their parents for this is pleasing in gods sight,and call no one your father on earth for you have one fatherthe one in heaven,1
6515,1TI,5,NRSV,the real widow left alone has set her hope on god and continues in supplications and prayers night and day but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison,1
6516,1TI,5,NRSV,give these commands as well so that they may be above reproach,and he said to his disciples make them sit down in groups of about fifty each,1
6517,1TI,5,NRSV,and whoever does not provide for relatives and especially for family members has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever,if the whole body were hearing where would the sense of smell be,1
6518,1TI,5,NRSV,let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once she must be well attested for her good works as one who has brought up children shown hospitality washed the saints feet helped the afflicted and devoted herself to doing good in every way,as you can find out it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship in jerusalem,1
6519,1TI,5,NRSV,but refuse to put younger widows on the list for when their sensual desires alienate them from christ they want to marry and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge,so the four angels were released who had been held ready for the hour the day the month and the year to kill a third of humankind,1
6520,1TI,5,NRSV,besides that they learn to be idle gadding about from house to house and they are not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say,i know that your last works are greater than the first,1
6521,1TI,5,NRSV,so i would have younger widows marry bear children and manage their households so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away,1
6522,1TI,5,NRSV,for some have already turned away to follow satan,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,1
6523,1TI,5,NRSV,if any believing woman has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows,and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us,1
6524,1TI,5,NRSV,let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor in preaching and teaching for the scripture says you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain and the laborer deserves to be paid,then people will come from east and west from north and south and will eat in the kingdom of god,1
6525,1TI,5,NRSV,never accept any accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses,but we urge you beloved to do so more and more to aspire to live quietly to mind your own affairs and to work with your hands as we directed you so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and be dependent on no one,1
6526,1TI,5,NRSV,as for those who persist in sin rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest also may stand in fear,about that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the way,1
6527,1TI,5,NRSV,in the presence of god and of christ jesus and of the elect angels i warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice doing nothing on the basis of partiality,and early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea,1
6528,1TI,5,NRSV,do not ordain anyone hastily and do not participate in the sins of others keep yourself pure,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover,1
6529,1TI,5,NRSV,no longer drink only water but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments,there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love,1
6530,1TI,5,NRSV,the sins of some people are conspicuous and precede them to judgment while the sins of others follow them there,the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we will not find him,1
6531,1TI,5,NRSV,so also good works are conspicuous and even when they are not they cannot remain hidden,if you conquer i will make you a pillar in the temple of my god you will never go out of it,1
6532,1TI,6,NRSV,let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of god and the teaching may not be blasphemed,and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her she should not divorce him,1
6533,1TI,6,NRSV,those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church rather they must serve them all the more since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved,but when god who had set me apart before i was born and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me so that i might proclaim him among the gentiles i did not confer with any human being nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me but i went away at once into arabia and afterwards i returned to damascus,1
6534,1TI,6,NRSV,whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our lord jesus christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness is conceited understanding nothing and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words,in the first book theophilus i wrote about all that jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the holy spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,1
6535,1TI,6,NRSV,from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain,he himself was not the light but he came to testify to the light,1
6536,1TI,6,NRSV,of course there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment for we brought nothing into the world so that we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with these,he brought paul down and had him stand before them,1
6537,1TI,6,NRSV,but those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction,and every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim jesus as the messiah,1
6538,1TI,6,NRSV,for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains,the first said to him i have bought a piece of land and i must go out and see it please accept my regrets,1
6539,1TI,6,NRSV,but as for you man of god shun all this pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance gentleness,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven,1
6540,1TI,6,NRSV,fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses,first moses says i will make you jealous of those who are not a nation with a foolish nation i will make you angry,1
6541,1TI,6,NRSV,in the presence of god who gives life to all things and of christ jesus who in his testimony before pontius pilate made the good confession i charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ which he will bring about at the right timehe who is the blessed and only sovereign the king of kings and lord of lords,now by this we may be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments,1
6542,1TI,6,NRSV,it is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no one has ever seen or can see to him be honor and eternal dominion,then the whole town came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they begged him to leave their neighborhood,1
6543,1TI,6,NRSV,as for those who in the present age are rich command them not to be haughty or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but rather on god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment,then turning toward the woman he said to simon do you see this woman,1
6544,1TI,6,NRSV,they are to do good to be rich in good works generous and ready to share thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of the life that really is life,but some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,1
6545,1TI,6,NRSV,timothy guard what has been entrusted to you,and they began saluting him hail king of the jews they struck his head with a reed spat upon him and knelt down in homage to him,1
6546,1TI,6,NRSV,avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith,and while they were shouting throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks and ordered him to be examined by flogging to find out the reason for this outcry against him,1
6547,2TI,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god for the sake of the promise of life that is in christ jesus to timothy my beloved child grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord,the next day we touched at samos and the day after that we came to miletus,1
6548,2TI,1,NRSV,i am grateful to godwhom i worship with a clear conscience as my ancestors didwhen i remember you constantly in my prayers night and day,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him,1
6549,2TI,1,NRSV,recalling your tears i long to see you so that i may be filled with joy,therefore friends select from among yourselves seven men of good standing full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint to this task while we for our part will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word,1
6550,2TI,1,NRSV,i am reminded of your sincere faith a faith that lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and now i am sure lives in you,but wanting to justify himself he asked jesus and who is my neighbor,1
6551,2TI,1,NRSV,for this reason i remind you to rekindle the gift of god that is within you through the laying on of my hands for god did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather a spirit of power and of love and of selfdiscipline,as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world,1
6552,2TI,1,NRSV,do not be ashamed then of the testimony about our lord or of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel relying on the power of god who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,1
6553,2TI,1,NRSV,this grace was given to us in christ jesus before the ages began but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our savior christ jesus who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love love one another deeply from the heart,1
6554,2TI,1,NRSV,for this gospel i was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher and for this reason i suffer as i do,we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies,1
6555,2TI,1,NRSV,but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him,fool what you sow does not come to life unless it dies,1

6558,2TI,1,NRSV,you are aware that all who are in asia have turned away from me including phygelus and hermogenes,and the angel said to me write this blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb,1
6559,2TI,1,NRSV,may the lord grant mercy to the household of onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain when he arrived in rome he eagerly searched for me and found me may the lord grant that he will find mercy from the lord on that day and you know very well how much service he rendered in ephesus,his father came out and began to plead with him,1
6560,2TI,2,NRSV,you then my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well,those who believe in him are not condemned but those who do not believe are condemned already because they have not believed in the name of the only son of god,1
6561,2TI,2,NRSV,share in suffering like a good soldier of christ jesus,since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life we are now turning to the gentiles,1
6562,2TI,2,NRSV,no one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs the soldiers aim is to please the enlisting officer,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,1
6563,2TI,2,NRSV,and in the case of an athlete no one is crowned without competing according to the rules,from this we know that it is the last hour,1
6564,2TI,2,NRSV,it is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of the crops,by faith joseph at the end of his life made mention of the exodus of the israelites and gave instructions about his burial,1

6566,2TI,2,NRSV,remember jesus christ raised from the dead a descendant of davidthat is my gospel for which i suffer hardship even to the point of being chained like a criminal,but martha was distracted by her many tasks so she came to him and asked lord do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself,1
6567,2TI,2,NRSV,but the word of god is not chained,is this blessedness then pronounced only on the circumcised or also on the uncircumcised,1
6568,2TI,2,NRSV,therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory,may i never boast of anything except the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world,1
6569,2TI,2,NRSV,the saying is sure if we have died with him we will also live with him if we endure we will also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself,those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men,1
6570,2TI,2,NRSV,remind them of this and warn them before god that they are to avoid wrangling over words which does no good but only ruins those who are listening,when they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them,1
6571,2TI,2,NRSV,do your best to present yourself to god as one approved by him a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly explaining the word of truth,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel will save it,1
6572,2TI,2,NRSV,avoid profane chatter for it will lead people into more and more impiety and their talk will spread like gangrene,he said also to the one who had invited him when you give a luncheon or a dinner do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors in case they may invite you in return and you would be repaid,1
6573,2TI,2,NRSV,among them are hymenaeus and philetus who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,1
6574,2TI,2,NRSV,they are upsetting the faith of some,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus,1
6575,2TI,2,NRSV,but gods firm foundation stands bearing this inscription the lord knows those who are his and let everyone who calls on the name of the lord turn away from wickedness,in this you rejoice even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more precious than gold that though perishable is tested by firemay be found to result in praise and glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed,1
6576,2TI,2,NRSV,in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay some for special use some for ordinary,but he denied it before all of them saying i do not know what you are talking about,1

6578,2TI,2,NRSV,shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord from a pure heart,therefore whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven,1
6579,2TI,2,NRSV,have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies you know that they breed quarrels,when he saw jesus he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god,1
6580,2TI,2,NRSV,and the lords servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone an apt teacher patient correcting opponents with gentleness,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment,1
6581,2TI,2,NRSV,god may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth and that they may escape from the snare of the devil having been held captive by him to do his will,there he made his home in a town called nazareth so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled he will be called a nazorean,1
6582,2TI,3,NRSV,you must understand this that in the last days distressing times will come,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,1

6584,2TI,3,NRSV,avoid them for among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth,being therefore exalted at the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured out this that you both see and hear,1
6585,2TI,3,NRSV,as jannes and jambres opposed moses so these people of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith also oppose the truth,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven,1
6586,2TI,3,NRSV,but they will not make much progress because as in the case of those two men their folly will become plain to everyone,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him,1
6587,2TI,3,NRSV,now you have observed my teaching my conduct my aim in life my faith my patience my love my steadfastness my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in antioch iconium and lystra,i think it right as long as i am in this body to refresh your memory since i know that my death will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me,1
6588,2TI,3,NRSV,what persecutions i endured yet the lord rescued me from all of them,look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces,1
6589,2TI,3,NRSV,indeed all who want to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts,1
6590,2TI,3,NRSV,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves,1
6591,2TI,3,NRSV,but as for you continue in what you have learned and firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in christ jesus,and are not all his sisters with us,1
6592,2TI,3,NRSV,all scripture is inspired by god and is useful for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness so that everyone who belongs to god may be proficient equipped for every good work,philip said to him come and see,1
6593,2TI,4,NRSV,in the presence of god and of christ jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom i solemnly urge you proclaim the message be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable convince rebuke and encourage with the utmost patience in teaching,so jesus called them and said to them you know that among the gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them,1
6594,2TI,4,NRSV,for the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths,welcome those who are weak in faith but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions,1
6595,2TI,4,NRSV,as for you always be sober endure suffering do the work of an evangelist carry out your ministry fully,he asked who are you lord,1
6596,2TI,4,NRSV,as for me i am already being poured out as a libation and the time of my departure has come,touch me and see for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have,1
6597,2TI,4,NRSV,i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith,by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to blaspheme and since i was so furiously enraged at them i pursued them even to foreign cities,1
6598,2TI,4,NRSV,from now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover,1
6599,2TI,4,NRSV,do your best to come to me soon for demas in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia titus to dalmatia,this agrees with the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and i will rebuild the dwelling of david which has fallen from its ruins i will rebuild it and i will set it up so that all other peoples may seek the lord even all the gentiles over whom my name has been called,1

6603,2TI,4,NRSV,alexander the coppersmith did me great harm the lord will pay him back for his deeds,god abides in those who confess that jesus is the son of god and they abide in god,1
6604,2TI,4,NRSV,you also must beware of him for he strongly opposed our message,on his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had become believers for he powerfully refuted the jews in public showing by the scriptures that the messiah is jesus,1
6605,2TI,4,NRSV,at my first defense no one came to my support but all deserted me,but peter said by no means lord for i have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean,1
6606,2TI,4,NRSV,may it not be counted against them but the lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the gentiles might hear it,he said to them but who do you say that i am,1
6607,2TI,4,NRSV,so i was rescued from the lions mouth,then i looked and there was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him were one hundred fortyfour thousand who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads,1
6608,2TI,4,NRSV,the lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom,if any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you as you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them,1
6609,2TI,4,NRSV,to him be the glory forever and ever,thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins but gods wrath has overtaken them at last,1
6610,2TI,4,NRSV,greet prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus,but abraham said child remember that during your lifetime you received your good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony,1

6614,2TI,4,NRSV,the lord be with your spirit,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for,1
6615,TIT,1,NRSV,paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ for the sake of the faith of gods elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness in the hope of eternal life that god who never lies promised before the ages began in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which i have been entrusted by the command of god our savior to titus my loyal child in the faith we share grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior,meanwhile when the crowd gathered by the thousands so that they trampled on one another he began to speak first to his disciples beware of the yeast of the pharisees that is their hypocrisy,1
6616,TIT,1,NRSV,i left you behind in crete for this reason so that you should put in order what remained to be done and should appoint elders in every town as i directed you someone who is blameless married only once whose children are believers not accused of debauchery and not rebellious,but god has so arranged the body giving the greater honor to the inferior member that there may be no dissension within the body but the members may have the same care for one another,1
6617,TIT,1,NRSV,for a bishop as gods steward must be blameless he must not be arrogant or quicktempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain but he must be hospitable a lover of goodness prudent upright devout and selfcontrolled,but in those days after that suffering the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in the heavens will be shaken,1
6618,TIT,1,NRSV,he must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it,she was of a great age having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage then as a widow to the age of eightyfour,1
6619,TIT,1,NRSV,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach,but the law does not rest on faith on the contrary whoever does the works of the law will live by them,1
6620,TIT,1,NRSV,it was one of them their very own prophet who said cretans are always liars vicious brutes lazy gluttons,either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for the tree is known by its fruit,1
6621,TIT,1,NRSV,for this reason rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith not paying attention to jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth,so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe,1
6622,TIT,1,NRSV,to the pure all things are pure but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure,all of these died in faith without having received the promises but from a distance they saw and greeted them,1

6625,TIT,1,NRSV,they are detestable disobedient unfit for any good work,such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the whole crowd stood on the beach,1
6626,TIT,2,NRSV,but as for you teach what is consistent with sound doctrine,when he had landed at caesarea he went up to jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to antioch,1
6627,TIT,2,NRSV,tell the older men to be temperate serious prudent and sound in faith in love and in endurance,which of the two did the will of his father,1
6628,TIT,2,NRSV,likewise tell the older women to be reverent in behavior not to be slanderers or slaves to drink they are to teach what is good so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children to be selfcontrolled chaste good managers of the household kind being submissive to their husbands so that the word of god may not be discredited,he is not here for he has been raised as he said,1
6629,TIT,2,NRSV,likewise urge the younger men to be selfcontrolled,the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were spellbound by what they heard,1
6630,TIT,2,NRSV,show yourself in all respects a model of good works and in your teaching show integrity gravity and sound speech that cannot be censured then any opponent will be put to shame having nothing evil to say of us,king herod heard of it for jesus name had become known,1
6631,TIT,2,NRSV,tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect they are not to talk back not to pilfer but to show complete and perfect fidelity so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of god our savior,was it not those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness,1
6632,TIT,2,NRSV,for the grace of god has appeared bringing salvation to all training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions and in the present age to live lives that are selfcontrolled upright and godly while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ,when he had said this one of the police standing nearby struck jesus on the face saying is that how you answer the high priest,1
6633,TIT,2,NRSV,he it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds,then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit,1
6634,TIT,2,NRSV,declare these things exhort and reprove with all authority,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also and jason has entertained them as guests,1
6635,TIT,2,NRSV,let no one look down on you,and even those of israel if they do not persist in unbelief will be grafted in for god has the power to graft them in again,1
6636,TIT,3,NRSV,remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show every courtesy to everyone,you philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel when i left macedonia no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone,1
6637,TIT,3,NRSV,for we ourselves were once foolish disobedient led astray slaves to various passions and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy despicable hating one another,they set up false witnesses who said this man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that moses handed on to us,1
6638,TIT,3,NRSV,but when the goodness and loving kindness of god our savior appeared he saved us not because of any works of righteousness that we had done but according to his mercy through the water of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit,jesus said to them you cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them can you,1
6639,TIT,3,NRSV,this spirit he poured out on us richly through jesus christ our savior so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life,you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is they that testify on my behalf,1
6640,TIT,3,NRSV,i desire that you insist on these things so that those who have come to believe in god may be careful to devote themselves to good works these things are excellent and profitable to everyone,he began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained the way of god to him more accurately,1
6641,TIT,3,NRSV,but avoid stupid controversies genealogies dissensions and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable and worthless,the law and the prophets were in effect until john came since then the good news of the kingdom of god is proclaimed and everyone tries to enter it by force,1
6642,TIT,3,NRSV,after a first and second admonition have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful being selfcondemned,the tempter came and said to him if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread,1
6643,TIT,3,NRSV,when i send artemas to you or tychicus do your best to come to me at nicopolis for i have decided to spend the winter there,and they called the blind man saying to him take heart get up he is calling you,1
6644,TIT,3,NRSV,make every effort to send zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way and see that they lack nothing,for this reason i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name,1
6645,TIT,3,NRSV,and let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs so that they may not be unproductive,they have stumbled over the stumbling stone as it is written see i am laying in zion a stone that will make people stumble a rock that will make them fall and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame,1
6646,TIT,3,NRSV,all who are with me send greetings to you,these are the ones on the path where the word is sown when they hear satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them,1
6647,TIT,3,NRSV,greet those who love us in the faith,jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength,1
6648,TIT,3,NRSV,grace be with all of you,when they had finished breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these,1
6649,PHM,1,NRSV,paul a prisoner of christ jesus and timothy our brother to philemon our dear friend and coworker to apphia our sister to archippus our fellow soldier and to the church in your house grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,he said in a loud voice fear god and give him glory for the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made heaven and earth the sea and the springs of water,1
6650,PHM,1,NRSV,when i remember you in my prayers i always thank my god because i hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the lord jesus,as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away,1
6651,PHM,1,NRSV,i pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for christ,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,1
6652,PHM,1,NRSV,i have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you my brother,so the crowd that had been with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify,1
6653,PHM,1,NRSV,for this reason though i am bold enough in christ to command you to do your duty yet i would rather appeal to you on the basis of loveand i paul do this as an old man and now also as a prisoner of christ jesus,john would have prevented him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me,1
6654,PHM,1,NRSV,i am appealing to you for my child onesimus whose father i have become during my imprisonment,there are some things in them hard to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures,1
6655,PHM,1,NRSV,formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me,such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land,1
6656,PHM,1,NRSV,i am sending him that is my own heart back to you,john however left them and returned to jerusalem but they went on from perga and came to antioch in pisidia,1
6657,PHM,1,NRSV,i wanted to keep him with me so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel but i preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved,1
6658,PHM,1,NRSV,perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brotherespecially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the lord,little children keep yourselves from idols,1
6659,PHM,1,NRSV,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me,but you have kept the good wine until now,1
6660,PHM,1,NRSV,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account,but as it is my kingdom is not from here,1
6661,PHM,1,NRSV,i paul am writing this with my own hand i will repay it,this man was seized by the jews and was about to be killed by them but when i had learned that he was a roman citizen i came with the guard and rescued him,1
6662,PHM,1,NRSV,i say nothing about your owing me even your own self,look your king is coming sitting on a donkeys colt his disciples did not understand these things at first but when jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him,1
6663,PHM,1,NRSV,yes brother let me have this benefit from you in the lord refresh my heart in christ,the great dragon was thrown down that ancient serpent who is called the devil and satan the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him,1
6664,PHM,1,NRSV,confident of your obedience i am writing to you knowing that you will do even more than i say,for you know the generous act of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that by his poverty you might become rich,1
6665,PHM,1,NRSV,one thing moreprepare a guest room for me for i am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you,you must understand this that in the last days distressing times will come,1
6666,PHM,1,NRSV,epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus sends greetings to you and so do mark aristarchus demas and luke my fellow workers,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises,1
6667,PHM,1,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit,when we heard this we and the people there urged him not to go up to jerusalem,1
6668,HEB,1,NRSV,long ago god spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken to us by a son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom he also created the worlds,yes i tell you and more than a prophet,1
6669,HEB,1,NRSV,he is the reflection of gods glory and the exact imprint of gods very being and he sustains all things by his powerful word,at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,1
6670,HEB,1,NRSV,when he had made purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again,1
6671,HEB,1,NRSV,for to which of the angels did god ever say you are my son today i have begotten you,run in such a way that you may win it,1
6672,HEB,1,NRSV,or again i will be his father and he will be my son,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire,1
6673,HEB,1,NRSV,and again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says let all gods angels worship him,what is it that they testify against you,1
6674,HEB,1,NRSV,of the angels he says he makes his angels winds and his servants flames of fire,and they said to him lord he has ten pounds i tell you to all those who have more will be given but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1
6675,HEB,1,NRSV,but of the son he says your throne o god is forever and ever and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom,to another he said follow me,1
6676,HEB,1,NRSV,you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions,now judas who betrayed him also knew the place because jesus often met there with his disciples,1
6677,HEB,1,NRSV,and in the beginning lord you founded the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands they will perish but you remain they will all wear out like clothing like a cloak you will roll them up and like clothing they will be changed,then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising god with a loud voice,1
6678,HEB,1,NRSV,but you are the same and your years will never end,you did not choose me but i chose you,1
6679,HEB,1,NRSV,but to which of the angels has he ever said sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet,throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple he departed and he went and hanged himself,1
6680,HEB,1,NRSV,are not all angels spirits in the divine service sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation,her parents were astounded but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened,1
6681,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it,i do not even judge myself,1
6682,HEB,2,NRSV,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him,1
6683,HEB,2,NRSV,it was declared at first through the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard him while god added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village,1
6684,HEB,2,NRSV,now god did not subject the coming world about which we are speaking to angels,fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses,1
6685,HEB,2,NRSV,but someone has testified somewhere what are human beings that you are mindful of them or mortals that you care for them,pilate asked him so you are a king,1
6686,HEB,2,NRSV,you have made them for a little while lower than the angels you have crowned them with glory and honor subjecting all things under their feet,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach,1
6687,HEB,2,NRSV,now in subjecting all things to them god left nothing outside their control,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe,1
6688,HEB,2,NRSV,as it is we do not yet see everything in subjection to them but we do see jesus who for a little while was made lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of god he might taste death for everyone,and we urge you beloved to admonish the idlers encourage the faint hearted help the weak be patient with all of them,1
6689,HEB,2,NRSV,it was fitting that god for whom and through whom all things exist in bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1
6690,HEB,2,NRSV,for the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one father,you have never heard his voice or seen his form and you do not have his word abiding in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent,1
6691,HEB,2,NRSV,for this reason jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters saying i will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters in the midst of the congregation i will praise you,but striking a reef they ran the ship aground the bow stuck and remained immovable but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves,1
6692,HEB,2,NRSV,and again i will put my trust in him,but he answered it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god,1
6693,HEB,2,NRSV,and again here am i and the children whom god has given me,for it is the gentiles who strive for all these things and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things,1
6694,HEB,2,NRSV,since therefore the children share flesh and blood he himself likewise shared the same things so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death,then they went on to another village,1
6695,HEB,2,NRSV,for it is clear that he did not come to help angels but the descendants of abraham,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea,1
6696,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of god to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people,he called out with a mighty voice fallen fallen is babylon the great it has become a dwelling place of demons a haunt of every foul spirit a haunt of every foul bird a haunt of every foul and hateful beast,1
6697,HEB,2,NRSV,because he himself was tested by what he suffered he is able to help those who are being tested,again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it,1
6698,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore brothers and sisters holy partners in a heavenly calling consider that jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession was faithful to the one who appointed him just as moses also was faithful in all gods house,just then there came a man named jairus a leader of the synagogue,1
6699,HEB,3,NRSV,yet jesus is worthy of more glory than moses just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight,1
6700,HEB,3,NRSV,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils,1
6701,HEB,3,NRSV,christ however was faithful over gods house as a son and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope,truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,1
6702,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion as on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors put me to the test though they had seen my works for forty years,the commandment we have from him is this those who love god must love their brothers and sisters also,1
6703,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore i was angry with that generation and i said they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways,therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will wear,1
6704,HEB,3,NRSV,as in my anger i swore they will not enter my rest,for the seven had married her,1
6705,HEB,3,NRSV,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,1
6706,HEB,3,NRSV,but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,by faith abraham when put to the test offered up isaac,1
6707,HEB,3,NRSV,for we have become partners of christ if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end,therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life,1
6708,HEB,3,NRSV,as it is said today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,1
6709,HEB,3,NRSV,now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious,if the world hates you be aware that it hated me before it hated you,1
6710,HEB,3,NRSV,was it not all those who left egypt under the leadership of moses,the crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by philip hearing and seeing the signs that he did for unclean spirits crying with loud shrieks came out of many who were possessed and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured,1
6711,HEB,3,NRSV,but with whom was he angry forty years,when jesus entered peters house he saw his motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to serve him,1
6712,HEB,3,NRSV,was it not those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness,then paul went upstairs and after he had broken bread and eaten he continued to converse with them until dawn then he left,1
6713,HEB,3,NRSV,and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if not to those who were disobedient,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him,1
6714,HEB,3,NRSV,so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief,at the same time pray for us as well that god will open to us a door for the word that we may declare the mystery of christ for which i am in prison so that i may reveal it clearly as i should,1
6715,HEB,4,NRSV,therefore while the promise of entering his rest is still open let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it,he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened,1
6716,HEB,4,NRSV,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord,1
6717,HEB,4,NRSV,for we who have believed enter that rest just as god has said as in my anger i swore they shall not enter my rest though his works were finished at the foundation of the world,you cannot serve god and wealth,1
6718,HEB,4,NRSV,for in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows and god rested on the seventh day from all his works,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow,1
6719,HEB,4,NRSV,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest,blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection,1
6720,HEB,4,NRSV,since therefore it remains open for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience again he sets a certain daytodaysaying through david much later in the words already quoted today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts,and jesus said to them you will all become deserters for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered,1
6721,HEB,4,NRSV,for if joshua had given them rest god would not speak later about another day,but he answered it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god,1
6722,HEB,4,NRSV,so then a sabbath rest still remains for the people of god for those who enter gods rest also cease from their labors as god did from his,so then whenever we have an opportunity let us work for the good of all and especially for those of the family of faith,1
6723,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs,so he said to them you are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others but god knows your hearts for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of god,1
6724,HEB,4,NRSV,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,it was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon while the suns light failed and the curtain of the temple was torn in two,1
6725,HEB,4,NRSV,and before him no creature is hidden but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account,when god raised up his servant he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways,1
6726,HEB,4,NRSV,since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our confession,jesus spoke up and said to him simon i have something to say to you,1
6727,HEB,4,NRSV,for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are yet without sin,he answered have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh,1
6728,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in hebrew rabbouni which means teacher,1
6729,HEB,5,NRSV,every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to god on their behalf to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins,jesus said to them have you never read in the scriptures the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the lords doing and it is amazing in our eyes,1
6730,HEB,5,NRSV,he is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is subject to weakness and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people,then he went home and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat,1
6731,HEB,5,NRSV,and one does not presume to take this honor but takes it only when called by god just as aaron was,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover,1
6732,HEB,5,NRSV,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he says also in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,for just as jonah became a sign to the people of nineveh so the son of man will be to this generation,1
6733,HEB,5,NRSV,in the days of his flesh jesus offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission,jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem,1
6734,HEB,5,NRSV,although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered and having been made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him having been designated by god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek,now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing around it and warming themselves,1
6735,HEB,5,NRSV,about this we have much to say that is hard to explain since you have become dull in understanding,it is my eager expectation and hope that i will not be put to shame in any way but that by my speaking with all boldness christ will be exalted now as always in my body whether by life or by death,1
6736,HEB,5,NRSV,for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of god,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him,1
6737,HEB,5,NRSV,you need milk not solid food for everyone who lives on milk being still an infant is unskilled in the word of righteousness,after this i looked and there was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation from all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and before the lamb robed in white with palm branches in their hands,1
6738,HEB,5,NRSV,but solid food is for the mature for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil,was it not all those who left egypt under the leadership of moses,1
6739,HEB,6,NRSV,therefore let us go on toward perfection leaving behind the basic teaching about christ and not laying again the foundation repentance from dead works and faith toward god instruction about baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight,1
6740,HEB,6,NRSV,and we will do this if god permits,but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth,1
6741,HEB,6,NRSV,for it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the holy spirit and have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the age to come and then have fallen away since on their own they are crucifying again the son of god and are holding him up to contempt,for as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not of the flesh and behaving according to human inclinations,1
6742,HEB,6,NRSV,ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from god,and we have seen and do testify that the father has sent his son as the savior of the world,1
6743,HEB,6,NRSV,but if it produces thorns and thistles it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed its end is to be burned over,is it not they who drag you into court,1
6744,HEB,6,NRSV,even though we speak in this way beloved we are confident of better things in your case things that belong to salvation,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised,1
6745,HEB,6,NRSV,for god is not unjust he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints as you still do,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,1
6746,HEB,6,NRSV,and we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end so that you may not become sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished,1
6747,HEB,6,NRSV,when god made a promise to abraham because he had no one greater by whom to swear he swore by himself saying i will surely bless you and multiply you,if there is anything they desire to know let them ask their husbands at home,1
6748,HEB,6,NRSV,and thus abraham having patiently endured obtained the promise,then looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him ephphatha that is be opened,1
6749,HEB,6,NRSV,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute,thus sarah obeyed abraham and called him lord,1
6750,HEB,6,NRSV,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us,but others said how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs,1
6751,HEB,6,NRSV,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,they had also a few small fish and after blessing them he ordered that these too should be distributed,1
6752,HEB,7,NRSV,this king melchizedek of salem priest of the most high god met abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him and to him abraham apportioned onetenth of everything,jesus said take away the stone,1
6753,HEB,7,NRSV,his name in the first place means king of righteousness next he is also king of salem that is king of peace,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months,1
6754,HEB,7,NRSV,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever,the believers from there when they heard of us came as far as the forum of appius and three taverns to meet us,1
6755,HEB,7,NRSV,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils,you will know them by their fruits,1
6756,HEB,7,NRSV,and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people that is from their kindred though these also are descended from abraham,and again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says let all gods angels worship him,1
6757,HEB,7,NRSV,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises,and he went out into the forecourt,1
6758,HEB,7,NRSV,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior,again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind when it was full they drew it ashore sat down and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad,1
6759,HEB,7,NRSV,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,for this is what the promise said about this time i will return and sarah shall have a son,1
6760,HEB,7,NRSV,one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him,and all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around peter,1
6761,HEB,7,NRSV,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron,and let everyone who hears say come,1
6762,HEB,7,NRSV,for when there is a change in the priesthood there is necessarily a change in the law as well,then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore,1
6763,HEB,7,NRSV,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead,1
6764,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is evident that our lord was descended from judah and in connection with that tribe moses said nothing about priests,in it were all kinds of fourfooted creatures and reptiles and birds of the air,1
6765,HEB,7,NRSV,it is even more obvious when another priest arises resembling melchizedek one who has become a priest not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him,1
6766,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is attested of him you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge but anyone who loves god is known by him,1
6767,HEB,7,NRSV,there is on the one hand the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual for the law made nothing perfect there is on the other hand the introduction of a better hope through which we approach god,they began to be distressed and to say to him one after another surely not i,1
6768,HEB,7,NRSV,this was confirmed with an oath for others who became priests took their office without an oath but this one became a priest with an oath because of the one who said to him the lord has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever accordingly jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare,1
6769,HEB,7,NRSV,furthermore the former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office but he holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever,after him judas the galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him he also perished and all who followed him were scattered,1
6770,HEB,7,NRSV,consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them,i do not say to you that i will ask the father on your behalf for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came from god,1
6771,HEB,7,NRSV,for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy blameless undefiled separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god,1
6772,HEB,7,NRSV,unlike the other high priests he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for those of the people this he did once for all when he offered himself,nevertheless you say since i was crafty i took you in by deceit,1
6773,HEB,7,NRSV,for the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness but the word of the oath which came later than the law appoints a son who has been made perfect forever,look the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out,1
6774,HEB,8,NRSV,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up,and when evening came jesus and his disciples went out of the city,1
6775,HEB,8,NRSV,for every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer,pilate asked him what is truth,1
6776,HEB,8,NRSV,now if he were on earth he would not be a priest at all since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law,for i see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness,1
6777,HEB,8,NRSV,they offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain,they went on from there and passed through galilee,1
6778,HEB,8,NRSV,but jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted through better promises,accursed children they have left the straight road and have gone astray following the road of balaam son of bosor who loved the wages of doing wrong but was rebuked for his own transgression a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophets madness,1
6779,HEB,8,NRSV,for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no need to look for a second one,men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error,1
6780,HEB,8,NRSV,god finds fault with them when he says the days are surely coming says the lord when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not like the covenant that i made with their ancestors on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt for they did not continue in my covenant and so i had no concern for them says the lord,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was eager to do,1
6781,HEB,8,NRSV,this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people,and whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him,1
6782,HEB,8,NRSV,and they shall not teach one another or say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith,1
6783,HEB,8,NRSV,for i will be merciful toward their iniquities and i will remember their sins no more,surely he will not come to the festival will he,1
6784,HEB,8,NRSV,in speaking of a new covenant he has made the first one obsolete,at that time they made a calf offered a sacrifice to the idol and reveled in the works of their hands,1
6785,HEB,8,NRSV,and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear,when he said this all his opponents were put to shame and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing,1
6786,HEB,9,NRSV,now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary,for everyone will be salted with fire,1
6787,HEB,9,NRSV,for a tent was constructed the first one in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence this is called the holy place,have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another,1
6788,HEB,9,NRSV,behind the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,and isaiah cries out concerning israel though the number of the children of israel were like the sand of the sea only a remnant of them will be saved for the lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively,1
6789,HEB,9,NRSV,in it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold in which there were a golden urn holding the manna and aarons rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat,and so brothers and sisters i could not speak to you as spiritual people but rather as people of the flesh as infants in christ,1
6790,HEB,9,NRSV,of these things we cannot speak now in detail,and this was how i saw the horses in my vision the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur the heads of the horses were like lions heads and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths,1
6791,HEB,9,NRSV,such preparations having been made the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties but only the high priest goes into the second and he but once a year and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,1
6792,HEB,9,NRSV,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing,those who love their life lose it and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life,1
6793,HEB,9,NRSV,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right,but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him,1
6794,HEB,9,NRSV,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption,but what does the scripture say,1
6795,HEB,9,NRSV,for if the blood of goats and bulls with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified how much more will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to god purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living god for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant,they caught hold of him but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked,1
6796,HEB,9,NRSV,where a will is involved the death of the one who made it must be established,but when the temple police went there they did not find them in the prison so they returned and reported we found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside,1
6797,HEB,9,NRSV,for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive,i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead,1
6798,HEB,9,NRSV,hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood,he also told them a parable no one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment otherwise the new will be torn and the piece from the new will not match the old,1
6799,HEB,9,NRSV,for when every commandment had been told to all the people by moses in accordance with the law he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people saying this is the blood of the covenant that god has ordained for you,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat,1
6800,HEB,9,NRSV,and in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship,do i say this on human authority,1
6801,HEB,9,NRSV,indeed under the law almost everything is purified with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me,1
6802,HEB,9,NRSV,thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices than these,while he was still speaking suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud a voice said this is my son the beloved with him i am well pleased listen to him when the disciples heard this they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear,1
6803,HEB,9,NRSV,for christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands a mere copy of the true one but he entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god on our behalf,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,1
6804,HEB,9,NRSV,nor was it to offer himself again and again as the high priest enters the holy place year after year with blood that is not his own for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world,he said to them he put mud on my eyes,1
6805,HEB,9,NRSV,but as it is he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way,1
6806,HEB,9,NRSV,and just as it is appointed for mortals to die once and after that the judgment so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him,in his anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground when he got up from prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief and he said to them why are you sleeping,1
6807,HEB,10,NRSV,since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities it can never by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year make perfect those who approach,do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery but be filled with the spirit as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves singing and making melody to the lord in your hearts giving thanks to god the father at all times and for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ,1
6808,HEB,10,NRSV,otherwise would they not have ceased being offered since the worshipers cleansed once for all would no longer have any consciousness of sin,he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd so that they would not crush him for he had cured many so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him,1
6809,HEB,10,NRSV,but in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year,jesus used this figure of speech with them but they did not understand what he was saying to them,1
6810,HEB,10,NRSV,for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins,when jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king he withdrew again to the mountain by himself,1
6811,HEB,10,NRSV,consequently when christ came into the world he said sacrifices and offerings you have not desired but a body you have prepared for me in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure,the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the lords great and glorious day,1
6812,HEB,10,NRSV,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me,and they will be upheld for the lord is able to make them stand,1
6813,HEB,10,NRSV,when he said above you have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings these are offered according to the law then he added see i have come to do your will,if therefore demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them bring charges there against one another,1
6814,HEB,10,NRSV,he abolishes the first in order to establish the second,and the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be amazed when they see the beast because it was and is not and is to come,1
6815,HEB,10,NRSV,and it is by gods will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all,five days later the high priest ananias came down with some elders and an attorney a certain tertullus and they reported their case against paul to the governor,1
6816,HEB,10,NRSV,and every priest stands day after day at his service offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins,and how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent,1
6817,HEB,10,NRSV,but when christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of god and since then has been waiting until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet,pilate asked him again have you no answer,1
6818,HEB,10,NRSV,for by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified,anyone whom you forgive i also forgive,1
6819,HEB,10,NRSV,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds he also adds i will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more,get up let us be going,1
6820,HEB,10,NRSV,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin,and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified,1
6821,HEB,10,NRSV,therefore my friends since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of jesus by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh and since we have a great priest over the house of god let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water,the whole assembly kept silence and listened to barnabas and paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that god had done through them among the gentiles,1
6822,HEB,10,NRSV,let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering for he who has promised is faithful,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there they departed,1
6823,HEB,10,NRSV,and let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter,1
6824,HEB,10,NRSV,for if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries,now john wore clothing of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and his food was locusts and wild honey,1
6825,HEB,10,NRSV,anyone who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses,to him be the power forever and ever,1
6826,HEB,10,NRSV,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace,for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit,1
6827,HEB,10,NRSV,for we know the one who said vengeance is mine i will repay,yet more than ever believers were added to the lord great numbers of both men and women so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats in order that peters shadow might fall on some of them as he came by,1
6828,HEB,10,NRSV,and again the lord will judge his people,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,1
6829,HEB,10,NRSV,it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,1
6830,HEB,10,NRSV,but recall those earlier days when after you had been enlightened you endured a hard struggle with sufferings sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution and sometimes being partners with those so treated,but what does the scripture say,1
6831,HEB,10,NRSV,for you had compassion for those who were in prison and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting,and the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said it is not right that we should neglect the word of god in order to wait on tables,1
6832,HEB,10,NRSV,do not therefore abandon that confidence of yours it brings a great reward,then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil,1
6833,HEB,10,NRSV,for you need endurance so that when you have done the will of god you may receive what was promised,now about eight days after these sayings jesus took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray,1
6834,HEB,10,NRSV,for yet in a very little while the one who is coming will come and will not delay but my righteous one will live by faith,i will therefore have him flogged and release him,1
6835,HEB,10,NRSV,my soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back,for if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment and if he did not spare the ancient world even though he saved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly and if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly and if he rescued lot a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust and who despise authority,1
6836,HEB,10,NRSV,but we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost but among those who have faith and so are saved,then jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so also the fish as much as they wanted,1
6837,HEB,11,NRSV,now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen,he asked them but who do you say that i am,1
6838,HEB,11,NRSV,indeed by faith our ancestors received approval,then he said i am a jew born in tarsus in cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel educated strictly according to our ancestral law being zealous for god just as all of you are today,1
6839,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of god so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1
6840,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abel offered to god a more acceptable sacrifice than cains,this is indeed the will of my father that all who see the son and believe in him may have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day,1
6841,HEB,11,NRSV,through this he received approval as righteous god himself giving approval to his gifts he died but through his faith he still speaks,but you yourselves wrong and defraudand believers at that,1
6842,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith enoch was taken so that he did not experience death and he was not found because god had taken him,and they called the blind man saying to him take heart get up he is calling you,1
6843,HEB,11,NRSV,for it was attested before he was taken away that he had pleased god,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god,1
6844,HEB,11,NRSV,and without faith it is impossible to please god for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him,avoid profane chatter for it will lead people into more and more impiety and their talk will spread like gangrene,1
6845,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith noah warned by god about events as yet unseen respected the warning and built an ark to save his household by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith,of this gospel i have become a servant according to the gift of gods grace that was given me by the working of his power,1
6846,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance and he set out not knowing where he was going,and you do many things like this,1
6847,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised as in a foreign land living in tents as did isaac and jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise,meanwhile saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the lord went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at damascus so that if he found any who belonged to the way men or women he might bring them bound to jerusalem,1
6848,HEB,11,NRSV,for he looked forward to the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is god,after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree,1
6849,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he received power of procreation even though he was too oldand sarah herself was barrenbecause he considered him faithful who had promised,this phrase yet once more indicates the removal of what is shakenthat is created thingsso that what cannot be shaken may remain,1
6850,HEB,11,NRSV,therefore from one person and this one as good as dead descendants were born as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore,a little later someone else on seeing him said you also are one of them,1
6851,HEB,11,NRSV,all of these died in faith without having received the promises but from a distance they saw and greeted them,when they reached ephesus he left them there but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews,1
6852,HEB,11,NRSV,they confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland,for this reason the jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me,1
6853,HEB,11,NRSV,if they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind they would have had opportunity to return,jesus answered them this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent,1
6854,HEB,11,NRSV,but as it is they desire a better country that is a heavenly one,but i refrain from it so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me even considering the exceptional character of the revelations,1
6855,HEB,11,NRSV,therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god indeed he has prepared a city for them,i ask then has god rejected his people,1
6856,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abraham when put to the test offered up isaac,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,1
6857,HEB,11,NRSV,he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son of whom he had been told it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you,slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh,1
6858,HEB,11,NRSV,he considered the fact that god is able even to raise someone from the deadand figuratively speaking he did receive him back,or again i will be his father and he will be my son,1
6859,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith isaac invoked blessings for the future on jacob and esau,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives,1
6860,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of joseph bowing in worship over the top of his staff,you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy,1
6861,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith joseph at the end of his life made mention of the exodus of the israelites and gave instructions about his burial,the inscription of the charge against him read the king of the jews,1
6862,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth because they saw that the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the kings edict,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,1
6863,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith moses when he was grown up refused to be called a son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to share illtreatment with the people of god than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread,1
6864,HEB,11,NRSV,he considered abuse suffered for the christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of egypt for he was looking ahead to the reward,when he laid his hands on her immediately she stood up straight and began praising god,1
6865,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he left egypt unafraid of the kings anger for he persevered as though he saw him who is invisible,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,1
6866,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of israel,but i will stay in ephesus until pentecost for a wide door for effective work has opened to me and there are many adversaries,1
6867,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith the people passed through the red sea as if it were dry land but when the egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned,but if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but to some extentnot to exaggerate itto all of you,1
6868,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith the walls of jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days,i am reminded of your sincere faith a faith that lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and now i am sure lives in you,1
6869,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient because she had received the spies in peace,when they saw this they made known what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,1
6870,HEB,11,NRSV,and what more should i say,never do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her,1
6871,HEB,11,NRSV,for time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice obtained promises shut the mouths of lions quenched raging fire escaped the edge of the sword won strength out of weakness became mighty in war put foreign armies to flight,on hearing this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus,1
6872,HEB,11,NRSV,women received their dead by resurrection,paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ for the sake of the faith of gods elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness in the hope of eternal life that god who never lies promised before the ages began in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which i have been entrusted by the command of god our savior to titus my loyal child in the faith we share grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior,1
6873,HEB,11,NRSV,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection,but woe to you pharisees for you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds and neglect justice and the love of god it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others,1
6874,HEB,11,NRSV,others suffered mocking and flogging and even chains and imprisonment,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught,1
6875,HEB,11,NRSV,they were stoned to death they were sawn in two they were killed by the sword they went about in skins of sheep and goats destitute persecuted tormented of whom the world was not worthy,so what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed,1
6876,HEB,11,NRSV,they wandered in deserts and mountains and in caves and holes in the ground,a certain ruler asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life,1
6877,HEB,11,NRSV,yet all these though they were commended for their faith did not receive what was promised since god had provided something better so that they would not apart from us be made perfect,for no one ever hates his own body but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it just as christ does for the church because we are members of his body,1
6878,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god,figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush,1
6879,HEB,12,NRSV,consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners so that you may not grow weary or lose heart,he was his mothers only son and she was a widow and with her was a large crowd from the town,1
6880,HEB,12,NRSV,in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood,therefore do not worry saying what will we eat,1
6881,HEB,12,NRSV,and you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children my child do not regard lightly the discipline of the lord or lose heart when you are punished by him for the lord disciplines those whom he loves and chastises every child whom he accepts,when the festival was ended and they started to return the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but his parents did not know it,1
6882,HEB,12,NRSV,endure trials for the sake of discipline,now if their stumbling means riches for the world and if their defeat means riches for gentiles how much more will their full inclusion mean now i am speaking to you gentiles,1
6883,HEB,12,NRSV,god is treating you as children for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline,jesus said truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not receive a hundredfold now in this agehouses brothers and sisters mothers and children and fields with persecutionsand in the age to come eternal life,1
6884,HEB,12,NRSV,if you do not have that discipline in which all children share then you are illegitimate and not his children,he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end,1
6885,HEB,12,NRSV,moreover we had human parents to discipline us and we respected them,moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath,1
6886,HEB,12,NRSV,should we not be even more willing to be subject to the father of spirits and live,then jesus said there was a man who had two sons,1
6887,HEB,12,NRSV,for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good in order that we may share his holiness,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,1
6888,HEB,12,NRSV,now discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it,but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him,1
6889,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1
6890,HEB,12,NRSV,pursue peace with everyone and the holiness without which no one will see the lord,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet,1
6891,HEB,12,NRSV,see to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of god that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble and through it many become defiled,he asked them what are you arguing about with them,1
6892,HEB,12,NRSV,see to it that no one becomes like esau an immoral and godless person who sold his birthright for a single meal,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,1
6893,HEB,12,NRSV,you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent even though he sought the blessing with tears,and as he discussed justice selfcontrol and the coming judgment felix became frightened and said go away for the present when i have an opportunity i will send for you,1
6894,HEB,12,NRSV,you have not come to something that can be touched a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them,as you therefore have received christ jesus the lord continue to live your lives in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith just as you were taught abounding in thanksgiving,1
6895,HEB,12,NRSV,for they could not endure the order that was given if even an animal touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit,1
6896,HEB,12,NRSV,indeed so terrifying was the sight that moses said i tremble with fear but you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel,they cried out in a loud voice saying salvation belongs to our god who is seated on the throne and to the lamb and all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped god singing amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our god forever and ever amen,1
6897,HEB,12,NRSV,see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven,they show that what the law requires is written on their hearts to which their own conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them on the day when according to my gospel god through jesus christ will judge the secret thoughts of all,1
6898,HEB,12,NRSV,this phrase yet once more indicates the removal of what is shakenthat is created thingsso that what cannot be shaken may remain,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder,1
6899,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us give thanks by which we offer to god an acceptable worship with reverence and awe for indeed our god is a consuming fire,then from the smoke came locusts on the earth and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth,1
6900,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus,1
6901,HEB,13,NRSV,remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with them those who are being tortured as though you yourselves were being tortured,but he said to them unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe,1
6902,HEB,13,NRSV,let marriage be held in honor by all and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled for god will judge fornicators and adulterers,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,1
6903,HEB,13,NRSV,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1
6904,HEB,13,NRSV,so we can say with confidence the lord is my helper i will not be afraid,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,1
6905,HEB,13,NRSV,what can anyone do to me,they said to him rabbi which translated means teacher where are you staying,1
6906,HEB,13,NRSV,remember your leaders those who spoke the word of god to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith,they went to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i pray,1
6907,HEB,13,NRSV,jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever,for so the lord has commanded us saying i have set you to be a light for the gentiles so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth,1
6908,HEB,13,NRSV,do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings for it is well for the heart to be strengthened by grace not by regulations about food which have not benefited those who observe them,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,1
6909,HEB,13,NRSV,we have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right to eat,as he went a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john who were in their boat mending the nets,1
6910,HEB,13,NRSV,for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest,1
6911,HEB,13,NRSV,therefore jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood,those who conducted paul brought him as far as athens and after receiving instructions to have silas and timothy join him as soon as possible they left him,1
6912,HEB,13,NRSV,let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured,god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins,1
6913,HEB,13,NRSV,for here we have no lasting city but we are looking for the city that is to come,while he was still speaking someone came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer,1
6914,HEB,13,NRSV,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name,and when this letter has been read among you have it read also in the church of the laodiceans and see that you read also the letter from laodicea,1
6915,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to god,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,1
6916,HEB,13,NRSV,obey your leaders and submit to them for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account,at that time herod the ruler heard reports about jesus and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him,1
6917,HEB,13,NRSV,let them do this with joy and not with sighingfor that would be harmful to you,when he had entered the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast it out,1
6918,HEB,13,NRSV,pray for us we are sure that we have a clear conscience desiring to act honorably in all things,they were all weeping and wailing for her but he said do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping,1
6919,HEB,13,NRSV,i urge you all the more to do this so that i may be restored to you very soon,and those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires,1
6920,HEB,13,NRSV,now may the god of peace who brought back from the dead our lord jesus the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of the eternal covenant make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will working among us that which is pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever and ever,and when they received it they grumbled against the landowner saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat,1
6921,HEB,13,NRSV,i appeal to you brothers and sisters bear with my word of exhortation for i have written to you briefly,the angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls,1
6922,HEB,13,NRSV,i want you to know that our brother timothy has been set free and if he comes in time he will be with me when i see you,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me,1
6923,HEB,13,NRSV,greet all your leaders and all the saints,and jesus who is called justus greets you,1
6924,HEB,13,NRSV,those from italy send you greetings,but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes only in the lord,1
6925,HEB,13,NRSV,grace be with all of you,so he went in and out among them in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord,1
6926,JAS,1,NRSV,james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes in the dispersion greetings,truly i tell you they have received their reward,1
6927,JAS,1,NRSV,my brothers and sisters whenever you face trials of any kind consider it nothing but joy because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its full effect so that you may be mature and complete lacking in nothing,all of them said let him be crucified then he asked why what evil has he done,1
6928,JAS,1,NRSV,if any of you is lacking in wisdom ask god who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly and it will be given you,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,1
6929,JAS,1,NRSV,but ask in faith never doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind for the doubter being doubleminded and unstable in every way must not expect to receive anything from the lord,again i ask did israel not understand,1
6930,JAS,1,NRSV,let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up and the rich in being brought low because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field,when they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition,1
6931,JAS,1,NRSV,for the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field its flower falls and its beauty perishes,when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path,1
6932,JAS,1,NRSV,it is the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life they will wither away,as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go,1
6933,JAS,1,NRSV,blessed is anyone who endures temptation,after eight days had passed it was time to circumcise the child and he was called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb,1
6934,JAS,1,NRSV,such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised,1
6935,JAS,1,NRSV,no one when tempted should say i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends,1
6936,JAS,1,NRSV,but one is tempted by ones own desire being lured and enticed by it then when that desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and that sin when it is fully grown gives birth to death,and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us,1
6937,JAS,1,NRSV,do not be deceived my beloved,and they will be upheld for the lord is able to make them stand,1
6938,JAS,1,NRSV,every generous act of giving with every perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change,but paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work,1
6939,JAS,1,NRSV,in fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures,for this i was appointed a herald and an apostle i am telling the truth i am not lying a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth,1
6940,JAS,1,NRSV,you must understand this my beloved let everyone be quick to listen slow to speak slow to anger for your anger does not produce gods righteousness,for if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment and if he did not spare the ancient world even though he saved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly and if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly and if he rescued lot a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust and who despise authority,1
6941,JAS,1,NRSV,therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls,the elder to the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not only i but also all who know the truth because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the fathers son in truth and love,1
6942,JAS,1,NRSV,but be doers of the word and not merely hearers who deceive themselves,then pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,1
6943,JAS,1,NRSV,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like,suddenly jesus met them and said greetings and they came to him took hold of his feet and worshiped him,1
6944,JAS,1,NRSV,but those who look into the perfect law the law of liberty and persevere being not hearers who forget but doers who actthey will be blessed in their doing,but others sneered and said they are filled with new wine,1
6945,JAS,1,NRSV,if any think they are religious and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts their religion is worthless,some were convinced by what he had said while others refused to believe,1
6946,JAS,1,NRSV,religion that is pure and undefiled before god the father is this to care for orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world,he also told them a parable no one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment otherwise the new will be torn and the piece from the new will not match the old,1
6947,JAS,2,NRSV,my brothers and sisters do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious lord jesus christ,i have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts he is coming with onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you,1
6948,JAS,2,NRSV,for if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say have a seat here please while to the one who is poor you say stand there or sit at my feet have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts,i solemnly command you by the lord that this letter be read to all of them,1
6949,JAS,2,NRSV,listen my beloved brothers and sisters,the same thing occurred in iconium where paul and barnabas went into the jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both jews and greeks became believers,1
6950,JAS,2,NRSV,has not god chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,1
6951,JAS,2,NRSV,but you have dishonored the poor,put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander together with all malice and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ has forgiven you,1
6952,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not the rich who oppress you,and suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting,1
6953,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not they who drag you into court,all these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer together with certain women including mary the mother of jesus as well as his brothers,1
6954,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you,but they urged him strongly saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over,1
6955,JAS,2,NRSV,you do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture you shall love your neighbor as yourself,then peter said to her how is it that you have agreed together to put the spirit of the lord to the test,1
6956,JAS,2,NRSV,but if you show partiality you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors,so death is at work in us but life in you,1
6957,JAS,2,NRSV,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,1
6958,JAS,2,NRSV,for the one who said you shall not commit adultery also said you shall not murder,above all maintain constant love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins,1
6959,JAS,2,NRSV,now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder you have become a transgressor of the law,and i heard the number of those who were sealed one hundred fortyfour thousand sealed out of every tribe of the people of israel from the tribe of judah twelve thousand sealed from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand from the tribe of gad twelve thousand from the tribe of asher twelve thousand from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand from the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand from the tribe of levi twelve thousand from the tribe of issachar twelve thousand from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand from the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand sealed,1
6960,JAS,2,NRSV,so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty,he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power,1
6961,JAS,2,NRSV,for judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy mercy triumphs over judgment,for who can resist his will,1
6962,JAS,2,NRSV,what good is it my brothers and sisters if you say you have faith but do not have works,peter went out and followed him he did not realize that what was happening with the angels help was real he thought he was seeing a vision,1
6963,JAS,2,NRSV,if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food and one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and eat your fill and yet you do not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him,1
6964,JAS,2,NRSV,so faith by itself if it has no works is dead,but when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and get his inheritance,1
6965,JAS,2,NRSV,but someone will say you have faith and i have works,and those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children,1
6966,JAS,2,NRSV,show me your faith apart from your works and i by my works will show you my faith,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus,1
6967,JAS,2,NRSV,you believe that god is one you do well,then the other disciple who reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead,1
6968,JAS,2,NRSV,do you want to be shown you senseless person that faith apart from works is barren,you believe that god is one you do well,1
6969,JAS,2,NRSV,was not our ancestor abraham justified by works when he offered his son isaac on the altar,you also see and hear that not only in ephesus but in almost the whole of asia this paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods,1
6970,JAS,2,NRSV,you see that faith was active along with his works and faith was brought to completion by the works,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand,1
6971,JAS,2,NRSV,thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god,and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith,1
6972,JAS,2,NRSV,you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone,your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me,1
6973,JAS,2,NRSV,likewise was not rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road,if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray,1
6974,JAS,2,NRSV,for just as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is also dead,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god,1
6975,JAS,3,NRSV,not many of you should become teachers my brothers and sisters for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness,no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord,1
6976,JAS,3,NRSV,for all of us make many mistakes,this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die,1
6977,JAS,3,NRSV,anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle,another said i will follow you lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home,1
6978,JAS,3,NRSV,if we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we guide their whole bodies,but as for you continue in what you have learned and firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in christ jesus,1
6979,JAS,3,NRSV,or look at ships though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,1
6980,JAS,3,NRSV,so also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great exploits,and the slave said sir what you ordered has been done and there is still room,1
6981,JAS,3,NRSV,how great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire and the tongue is a fire,but it is god who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts as a first installment,1
6982,JAS,3,NRSV,the tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity it stains the whole body sets on fire the cycle of nature and is itself set on fire by hell,a disciple is not above the teacher nor a slave above the master it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher and the slave like the master,1
6983,JAS,3,NRSV,for every species of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species but no one can tame the tonguea restless evil full of deadly poison,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1
6984,JAS,3,NRSV,with it we bless the lord and father and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of god,the angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls,1
6985,JAS,3,NRSV,from the same mouth come blessing and cursing,two women will be grinding meal together one will be taken and one will be left,1
6986,JAS,3,NRSV,my brothers and sisters this ought not to be so,instead you ought to say if the lord wishes we will live and do this or that,1
6987,JAS,3,NRSV,does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb,1
6988,JAS,3,NRSV,can a fig tree my brothers and sisters yield olives or a grapevine figs,but jesus said to him let the dead bury their own dead but as for you go and proclaim the kingdom of god,1
6989,JAS,3,NRSV,no more can salt water yield fresh,and now lord look at their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant jesus,1
6990,JAS,3,NRSV,who is wise and understanding among you,for he says at an acceptable time i have listened to you and on a day of salvation i have helped you,1
6991,JAS,3,NRSV,show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom,i rejoice at the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus because they have made up for your absence for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours,1
6992,JAS,3,NRSV,but if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not be boastful and false to the truth,the name of the star is wormwood,1
6993,JAS,3,NRSV,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish,not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down,1
6994,JAS,3,NRSV,for where there is envy and selfish ambition there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind,then he said to them all if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me,1
6995,JAS,3,NRSV,but the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable gentle willing to yield full of mercy and good fruits without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy,for life is more than food and the body more than clothing,1
6996,JAS,3,NRSV,and a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace,i was dead and see i am alive forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of hades,1
6997,JAS,4,NRSV,those conflicts and disputes among you where do they come from,for just as jonah became a sign to the people of nineveh so the son of man will be to this generation,1
6998,JAS,4,NRSV,do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment,1
6999,JAS,4,NRSV,you want something and do not have it so you commit murder,when christ who is your life is revealed then you also will be revealed with him in glory,1
7000,JAS,4,NRSV,and you covet something and cannot obtain it so you engage in disputes and conflicts,for to me living is christ and dying is gain,1
7001,JAS,4,NRSV,you do not have because you do not ask,so who then are you to judge your neighbor,1
7002,JAS,4,NRSV,you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly in order to spend what you get on your pleasures,what do you mean by saying you will be made free,1
7003,JAS,4,NRSV,adulterers do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus,1
7004,JAS,4,NRSV,therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god,or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered,1
7005,JAS,4,NRSV,or do you suppose that it is for nothing that the scripture says god yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us,these are blemishes on your lovefeasts while they feast with you without fear feeding themselves,1
7006,JAS,4,NRSV,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,and we have confidence in the lord concerning you that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command,1
7007,JAS,4,NRSV,resist the devil and he will flee from you,pray also for me so that when i speak a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains,1
7008,JAS,4,NRSV,draw near to god and he will draw near to you,and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love i am nothing,1
7009,JAS,4,NRSV,cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doubleminded,then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them,1
7010,JAS,4,NRSV,let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly,1
7011,JAS,4,NRSV,humble yourselves before the lord and he will exalt you,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove,1
7012,JAS,4,NRSV,do not speak evil against one another brothers and sisters,and he cured many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons and he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him,1
7013,JAS,4,NRSV,whoever speaks evil against another or judges another speaks evil against the law and judges the law but if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews,1
7014,JAS,4,NRSV,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy,but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison doors brought them out and said go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life,1
7015,JAS,4,NRSV,so who then are you to judge your neighbor,therefore encourage one another and build up each other as indeed you are doing,1
7016,JAS,4,NRSV,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money,he prostrated himself at jesus feet and thanked him,1
7017,JAS,4,NRSV,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring,and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home,1
7018,JAS,4,NRSV,for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes,when herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men he was infuriated and he sent and killed all the children in and around bethlehem who were two years old or under according to the time that he had learned from the wise men,1
7019,JAS,4,NRSV,instead you ought to say if the lord wishes we will live and do this or that,but herod the ruler who had been rebuked by him because of herodias his brothers wife and because of all the evil things that herod had done added to them all by shutting up john in prison,1
7020,JAS,4,NRSV,as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil,if you knew me you would know my father also,1
7021,JAS,4,NRSV,anyone then who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it commits sin,who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that jesus is the son of god,1
7022,JAS,5,NRSV,come now you rich people weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you,just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if it were a matter of crime or serious villainy i would be justified in accepting the complaint of you jews but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters,1
7023,JAS,5,NRSV,your riches have rotted and your clothes are motheaten,then he took it down wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a rockhewn tomb where no one had ever been laid,1
7024,JAS,5,NRSV,your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be evidence against you and it will eat your flesh like fire,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven,1
7025,JAS,5,NRSV,you have laid up treasure for the last days,if you know me you will know my father also,1
7026,JAS,5,NRSV,listen the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you kept back by fraud cry out and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts,now there was a good and righteous man named joseph who though a member of the council had not agreed to their plan and action,1
7027,JAS,5,NRSV,you have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,1
7028,JAS,5,NRSV,you have condemned and murdered the righteous one who does not resist you,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh,1
7029,JAS,5,NRSV,be patient therefore beloved until the coming of the lord,and he appointed twelve whom he also named apostles to be with him and to be sent out to proclaim the message and to have authority to cast out demons,1
7030,JAS,5,NRSV,the farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan,1
7031,JAS,5,NRSV,strengthen your hearts for the coming of the lord is near,a great number of people would also gather from the towns around jerusalem bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits and they were all cured,1
7032,JAS,5,NRSV,beloved do not grumble against one another so that you may not be judged,since he wanted to find out what paul was being accused of by the jews the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet,1
7033,JAS,5,NRSV,see the judge is standing at the doors as an example of suffering and patience beloved take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord,still i think it necessary to send to you epaphroditusmy brother and coworker and fellow soldier your messenger and minister to my need for he has been longing for all of you and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill,1
7034,JAS,5,NRSV,indeed we call blessed those who showed endurance,the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own but the father who dwells in me does his works,1
7035,JAS,5,NRSV,you have heard of the endurance of job and you have seen the purpose of the lord how the lord is compassionate and merciful,other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and they sprang up quickly since they had no depth of soil,1
7036,JAS,5,NRSV,above all my beloved do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath but let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not fall under condemnation,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this,1
7037,JAS,5,NRSV,they should sing songs of praise,other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain,1
7038,JAS,5,NRSV,they should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them anointing them with oil in the name of the lord,after jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum,1
7039,JAS,5,NRSV,the prayer of faith will save the sick and the lord will raise them up and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven,at once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of galilee,1
7040,JAS,5,NRSV,therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed,i know the slander on the part of those who say that they are jews and are not but are a synagogue of satan,1
7041,JAS,5,NRSV,the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the church of god that is in corinth including all the saints throughout achaia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1
7042,JAS,5,NRSV,elijah was a human being like us and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth,the blind man said to him my teacher let me see again,1
7043,JAS,5,NRSV,then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest,so they took soundings and found twenty fathoms a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms,1
7044,JAS,5,NRSV,my brothers and sisters if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinners soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins,but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty,1
7045,1PE,1,NRSV,peter an apostle of jesus christ to the exiles of the dispersion in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia who have been chosen and destined by god the father and sanctified by the spirit to be obedient to jesus christ and to be sprinkled with his blood may grace and peace be yours in abundance,one of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well he asked him which commandment is the first of all,1
7046,1PE,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ by his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead and into an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you who are being protected by the power of god through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time,so they said again to the blind man what do you say about him,1
7047,1PE,1,NRSV,in this you rejoice even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more precious than gold that though perishable is tested by firemay be found to result in praise and glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed,he must manage his own household well keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how can he take care of gods church,1
7048,1PE,1,NRSV,although you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy for you are receiving the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean,1
7049,1PE,1,NRSV,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory,has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use,1
7050,1PE,1,NRSV,it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who brought you good news by the holy spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look therefore prepare your minds for action discipline yourselves set all your hope on the grace that jesus christ will bring you when he is revealed,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,1
7051,1PE,1,NRSV,like obedient children do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance,as he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving jericho bartimaeus son of timaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside,1
7052,1PE,1,NRSV,instead as he who called you is holy be holy yourselves in all your conduct for it is written you shall be holy for i am holy,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,1
7053,1PE,1,NRSV,if you invoke as father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds live in reverent fear during the time of your exile,in the resurrection whose wife will she be,1
7054,1PE,1,NRSV,you know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors not with perishable things like silver or gold but with the precious blood of christ like that of a lamb without defect or blemish,the men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one,1
7055,1PE,1,NRSV,he was destined before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake,for to this end we toil and struggle because we have our hope set on the living god who is the savior of all people especially of those who believe,1
7056,1PE,1,NRSV,through him you have come to trust in god who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are set on god,everything that the father gives me will come to me and anyone who comes to me i will never drive away for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me,1
7057,1PE,1,NRSV,now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love love one another deeply from the heart,but i found that he had done nothing deserving death and when he appealed to his imperial majesty i decided to send him,1
7058,1PE,1,NRSV,you have been born anew not of perishable but of imperishable seed through the living and enduring word of god,and they said some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets,1
7059,1PE,1,NRSV,for all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass,they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day,1
7060,1PE,1,NRSV,the grass withers and the flower falls but the word of the lord endures forever,so they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea,1
7061,1PE,1,NRSV,that word is the good news that was announced to you,jesus answered them truly i tell you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will be done,1
7062,1PE,2,NRSV,rid yourselves therefore of all malice and all guile insincerity envy and all slander,some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath,1
7063,1PE,2,NRSV,like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow into salvation if indeed you have tasted that the lord is good,he left that place and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him,1
7064,1PE,2,NRSV,come to him a living stone though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in gods sight and like living stones let yourselves be built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ,beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them for then you have no reward from your father in heaven,1
7065,1PE,2,NRSV,for it stands in scripture see i am laying in zion a stone a cornerstone chosen and precious and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame,and those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children,1
7066,1PE,2,NRSV,to you then who believe he is precious but for those who do not believe the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner and a stone that makes them stumble and a rock that makes them fall,since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our confession,1
7067,1PE,2,NRSV,they stumble because they disobey the word as they were destined to do,for the present form of this world is passing away,1
7068,1PE,2,NRSV,but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation gods own people in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light,and he said beware that you are not led astray for many will come in my name and say i am he and the time is near do not go after them,1
7069,1PE,2,NRSV,once you were not a people but now you are gods people once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy,and great fear seized the whole church and all who heard of these things,1
7070,1PE,2,NRSV,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once she must be well attested for her good works as one who has brought up children shown hospitality washed the saints feet helped the afflicted and devoted herself to doing good in every way,1
7071,1PE,2,NRSV,conduct yourselves honorably among the gentiles so that though they malign you as evildoers they may see your honorable deeds and glorify god when he comes to judge,then jesus began to say to them beware that no one leads you astray,1
7072,1PE,2,NRSV,for the lords sake accept the authority of every human institution whether of the emperor as supreme or of governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right,but he said to him friend who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you,1
7073,1PE,2,NRSV,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish,nevertheless in the lord woman is not independent of man or man independent of woman,1
7074,1PE,2,NRSV,as servants of god live as free people yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil,it is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not mourn,1
7075,1PE,2,NRSV,slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh,the next day we touched at samos and the day after that we came to miletus,1
7076,1PE,2,NRSV,for it is a credit to you if being aware of god you endure pain while suffering unjustly,so he divided his property between them,1
7077,1PE,2,NRSV,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that,i reprove and discipline those whom i love,1
7078,1PE,2,NRSV,but if you endure when you do right and suffer for it you have gods approval,for it was attested before he was taken away that he had pleased god,1
7079,1PE,2,NRSV,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price,1
7080,1PE,2,NRSV,he committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire,1
7081,1PE,2,NRSV,when he was abused he did not return abuse when he suffered he did not threaten but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly,and the things you have prepared whose will they be,1
7082,1PE,2,NRSV,he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that free from sins we might live for righteousness by his wounds you have been healed,through this he received approval as righteous god himself giving approval to his gifts he died but through his faith he still speaks,1
7083,1PE,2,NRSV,for you were going astray like sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls,the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers and they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1
7084,1PE,3,NRSV,wives in the same way accept the authority of your husbands so that even if some of them do not obey the word they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct when they see the purity and reverence of your lives,but they had no children because elizabeth was barren and both were getting on in years,1
7085,1PE,3,NRSV,do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing rather let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is very precious in gods sight,in the same way the one who had the two talents made two more talents,1
7086,1PE,3,NRSV,it was in this way long ago that the holy women who hoped in god used to adorn themselves by accepting the authority of their husbands,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,1
7087,1PE,3,NRSV,thus sarah obeyed abraham and called him lord,for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them,1
7088,1PE,3,NRSV,you have become her daughters as long as you do what is good and never let fears alarm you,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them,1
7089,1PE,3,NRSV,husbands in the same way show consideration for your wives in your life together paying honor to the woman as the weaker sex since they too are also heirs of the gracious gift of lifeso that nothing may hinder your prayers,and since they did not see fit to acknowledge god god gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done,1
7090,1PE,3,NRSV,finally all of you have unity of spirit sympathy love for one another a tender heart and a humble mind,where o death is your victory,1
7091,1PE,3,NRSV,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out,1
7092,1PE,3,NRSV,it is for this that you were calledthat you might inherit a blessing,they replied we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish,1
7093,1PE,3,NRSV,for those who desire life and desire to see good days let them keep their tongues from evil and their lips from speaking deceit let them turn away from evil and do good let them seek peace and pursue it,but he turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,1
7094,1PE,3,NRSV,for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you,1
7095,1PE,3,NRSV,but the face of the lord is against those who do evil,to him be the power forever and ever,1
7096,1PE,3,NRSV,now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed,1
7097,1PE,3,NRSV,but even if you do suffer for doing what is right you are blessed,but some of you thinking that i am not coming to you have become arrogant,1
7098,1PE,3,NRSV,do not fear what they fear and do not be intimidated but in your hearts sanctify christ as lord,saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus,1
7099,1PE,3,NRSV,always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and reverence,so if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out,1
7100,1PE,3,NRSV,keep your conscience clear so that when you are maligned those who abuse you for your good conduct in christ may be put to shame,the next day paul went with us to visit james and all the elders were present,1
7101,1PE,3,NRSV,for it is better to suffer for doing good if suffering should be gods will than to suffer for doing evil,by faith noah warned by god about events as yet unseen respected the warning and built an ark to save his household by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith,1
7102,1PE,3,NRSV,for christ also suffered for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous in order to bring you to god,for the one who said you shall not commit adultery also said you shall not murder,1
7103,1PE,3,NRSV,he was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison who in former times did not obey when god waited patiently in the days of noah during the building of the ark in which a few that is eight persons were saved through water,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters,1
7104,1PE,3,NRSV,and baptism which this prefigured now saves younot as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to god for a good conscience through the resurrection of jesus christ who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god with angels authorities and powers made subject to him,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves,1
7105,1PE,4,NRSV,since therefore christ suffered in the flesh arm yourselves also with the same intention for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of god,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven,1
7106,1PE,4,NRSV,you have already spent enough time in doing what the gentiles like to do living in licentiousness passions drunkenness revels carousing and lawless idolatry,what is it that they testify against you,1
7107,1PE,4,NRSV,they are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation and so they blaspheme,if you know me you will know my father also,1
7108,1PE,4,NRSV,but they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead,but wanting to justify himself he asked jesus and who is my neighbor,1
7109,1PE,4,NRSV,for this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead so that though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged they might live in the spirit as god does,he answered i will not but later he changed his mind and went,1
7110,1PE,4,NRSV,the end of all things is near therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers,they tie up heavy burdens hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of others but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them,1
7111,1PE,4,NRSV,above all maintain constant love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire,1
7112,1PE,4,NRSV,be hospitable to one another without complaining,now as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in utmost eagerness and in our love for you so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking,1
7113,1PE,4,NRSV,like good stewards of the manifold grace of god serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received,god is faithful by him you were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord,1
7114,1PE,4,NRSV,whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of god whoever serves must do so with the strength that god supplies so that god may be glorified in all things through jesus christ,and they began saluting him hail king of the jews they struck his head with a reed spat upon him and knelt down in homage to him,1
7115,1PE,4,NRSV,to him belong the glory and the power forever and ever,but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he was able to stand,1
7116,1PE,4,NRSV,beloved do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you as though something strange were happening to you,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss,1
7117,1PE,4,NRSV,but rejoice insofar as you are sharing christs sufferings so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed,then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground he took the seven loaves and the fish and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds,1
7118,1PE,4,NRSV,if you are reviled for the name of christ you are blessed because the spirit of glory which is the spirit of god is resting on you,and as he sat at dinner in levis house many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting with jesus and his disciplesfor there were many who followed him,1
7119,1PE,4,NRSV,but let none of you suffer as a murderer a thief a criminal or even as a mischief maker,for who can resist his will,1
7120,1PE,4,NRSV,yet if any of you suffers as a christian do not consider it a disgrace but glorify god because you bear this name,whoever has the son has life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life,1
7121,1PE,4,NRSV,for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of god if it begins with us what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of god,jesus answered do you ask this on your own or did others tell you about me,1
7122,1PE,4,NRSV,and if it is hard for the righteous to be saved what will become of the ungodly and the sinners,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,1
7123,1PE,4,NRSV,therefore let those suffering in accordance with gods will entrust themselves to a faithful creator while continuing to do good,salt is good but if salt has lost its saltiness how can you season it,1
7124,1PE,5,NRSV,now as an elder myself and a witness of the sufferings of christ as well as one who shares in the glory to be revealed i exhort the elders among you to tend the flock of god that is in your charge exercising the oversight not under compulsion but willingly as god would have you do it not for sordid gain but eagerly,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest heaven and on earth peace among those whom he favors when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another let us go now to bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place which the lord has made known to us,1
7125,1PE,5,NRSV,do not lord it over those in your charge but be examples to the flock,for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god,1
7126,1PE,5,NRSV,and when the chief shepherd appears you will win the crown of glory that never fades away,the tribune replied do you know greek,1
7127,1PE,5,NRSV,in the same way you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders,those from italy send you greetings,1
7128,1PE,5,NRSV,and all of you must clothe yourselves with humility in your dealings with one another for god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,therefore i sent for you immediately and you have been kind enough to come,1
7129,1PE,5,NRSV,humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god so that he may exalt you in due time,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover,1
7130,1PE,5,NRSV,cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this,1
7131,1PE,5,NRSV,like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around looking for someone to devour,how could you fail to perceive that i was not speaking about bread,1
7132,1PE,5,NRSV,resist him steadfast in your faith for you know that your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering,but they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him,1
7133,1PE,5,NRSV,and after you have suffered for a little while the god of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself restore support strengthen and establish you,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you,1
7134,1PE,5,NRSV,to him be the power forever and ever,and many false prophets will arise and lead many astray,1
7135,1PE,5,NRSV,through silvanus whom i consider a faithful brother i have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of god,it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce,1
7136,1PE,5,NRSV,your sister church in babylon chosen together with you sends you greetings and so does my son mark,jesus said to him friend do what you are here to do,1
7137,1PE,5,NRSV,greet one another with a kiss of love,i have said these things to you in figures of speech,1
7138,1PE,5,NRSV,peace to all of you who are in christ,and as they went they were made clean,1
7139,2PE,1,NRSV,simeon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ may grace and peace be yours in abundance in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord,i will therefore have him flogged and release him,1
7140,2PE,1,NRSV,his divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness,then the people as a whole answered his blood be on us and on our children so he released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified,1
7141,2PE,1,NRSV,thus he has given us through these things his precious and very great promises so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become participants of the divine nature,but someone will ask how are the dead raised,1
7142,2PE,1,NRSV,for this very reason you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness and goodness with knowledge and knowledge with selfcontrol and selfcontrol with endurance and endurance with godliness and godliness with mutual affection and mutual affection with love,while they were stoning stephen he prayed lord jesus receive my spirit,1
7143,2PE,1,NRSV,for if these things are yours and are increasing among you they keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ,and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me,1
7144,2PE,1,NRSV,for anyone who lacks these things is nearsighted and blind and is forgetful of the cleansing of past sins,for freedom christ has set us free,1
7145,2PE,1,NRSV,therefore brothers and sisters be all the more eager to confirm your call and election for if you do this you will never stumble,so if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision,1
7146,2PE,1,NRSV,for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly provided for you,its gates will never be shut by dayand there will be no night there,1
7147,2PE,1,NRSV,therefore i intend to keep on reminding you of these things though you know them already and are established in the truth that has come to you,he answered i tell you if these were silent the stones would shout out,1
7148,2PE,1,NRSV,i think it right as long as i am in this body to refresh your memory since i know that my death will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me,but when the temple police went there they did not find them in the prison so they returned and reported we found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside,1
7149,2PE,1,NRSV,and i will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things,they have tails like scorpions with stingers and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months,1
7150,2PE,1,NRSV,for we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty,then simeon blessed them and said to his mother mary this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealedand a sword will pierce your own soul too,1
7151,2PE,1,NRSV,for he received honor and glory from god the father when that voice was conveyed to him by the majestic glory saying this is my son my beloved with whom i am well pleased,therefore when we could bear it no longer we decided to be left alone in athens and we sent timothy our brother and coworker for god in proclaiming the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions,1
7152,2PE,1,NRSV,we ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain,remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show every courtesy to everyone,1
7153,2PE,1,NRSV,so we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed,if one member suffers all suffer together with it if one member is honored all rejoice together with it,1
7154,2PE,1,NRSV,you will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,but the residents of the city were divided some sided with the jews and some with the apostles,1
7155,2PE,1,NRSV,first of all you must understand this that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation because no prophecy ever came by human will but men and women moved by the holy spirit spoke from god,certainly not let them come and take us out themselves,1
7156,2PE,2,NRSV,but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive opinions,then he came forward and touched the bier and the bearers stood still,1
7157,2PE,2,NRSV,they will even deny the master who bought thembringing swift destruction on themselves,for anyone who lacks these things is nearsighted and blind and is forgetful of the cleansing of past sins,1
7158,2PE,2,NRSV,even so many will follow their licentious ways and because of these teachers the way of truth will be maligned,there will be two women grinding meal together one will be taken and the other left,1
7159,2PE,2,NRSV,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words,and he took him by the right hand and raised him up and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong,1
7160,2PE,2,NRSV,their condemnation pronounced against them long ago has not been idle and their destruction is not asleep,truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom,1
7161,2PE,2,NRSV,for if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment and if he did not spare the ancient world even though he saved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly and if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly and if he rescued lot a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust and who despise authority,and he said to them what is it you want me to do for you,1
7162,2PE,2,NRSV,bold and willful they are not afraid to slander the glorious ones whereas angels though greater in might and power do not bring against them a slanderous judgment from the lord,i also know that you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake of my name and that you have not grown weary,1
7163,2PE,2,NRSV,these people however are like irrational animals mere creatures of instinct born to be caught and killed,paul went to see them and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and they worked togetherby trade they were tentmakers,1
7164,2PE,2,NRSV,they slander what they do not understand and when those creatures are destroyed they also will be destroyed suffering the penalty for doing wrong,if god has been glorified in him god will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once,1
7165,2PE,2,NRSV,they count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them,1
7166,2PE,2,NRSV,they are blots and blemishes reveling in their dissipation while they feast with you,and when he shouted the seven thunders sounded,1
7167,2PE,2,NRSV,they have eyes full of adultery insatiable for sin,when they asked him to stay longer he declined but on taking leave of them he said i will return to you if god wills,1
7168,2PE,2,NRSV,they have hearts trained in greed,then he said to them oh how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared was it not necessary that the messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory,1
7169,2PE,2,NRSV,accursed children they have left the straight road and have gone astray following the road of balaam son of bosor who loved the wages of doing wrong but was rebuked for his own transgression a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophets madness,for it is not those who commend themselves that are approved but those whom the lord commends,1
7170,2PE,2,NRSV,these are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm for them the deepest darkness has been reserved,listen i am standing at the door knocking if you hear my voice and open the door i will come in to you and eat with you and you with me,1
7171,2PE,2,NRSV,for they speak bombastic nonsense and with licentious desires of the flesh they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error,they will receive the greater condemnation,1
7172,2PE,2,NRSV,they promise them freedom but they themselves are slaves of corruption for people are slaves to whatever masters them,i tell you on the day of judgment you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned,1
7173,2PE,2,NRSV,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment,1
7174,2PE,2,NRSV,for it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that was passed on to them,for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead if the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy then the whole batch is holy and if the root is holy then the branches also are holy,1
7175,2PE,2,NRSV,it has happened to them according to the true proverb the dog turns back to its own vomit and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mud,to the rest i sayi and not the lordthat if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her,1
7176,2PE,3,NRSV,this is now beloved the second letter i am writing to you in them i am trying to arouse your sincere intention by reminding you that you should remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of the lord and savior spoken through your apostles,by no means but through their stumbling salvation has come to the gentiles so as to make israel jealous,1
7177,2PE,3,NRSV,first of all you must understand this that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and indulging their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming,when they heard this they said heaven forbid but he looked at them and said what then does this text mean the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,1
7178,2PE,3,NRSV,for ever since our ancestors died all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation they deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of god heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished,then they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them what were you arguing about on the way,1
7179,2PE,3,NRSV,but by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the godless,for the law brings wrath but where there is no law neither is there violation,1
7180,2PE,3,NRSV,but do not ignore this one fact beloved that with the lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day,but at the judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you,1
7181,2PE,3,NRSV,the lord is not slow about his promise as some think of slowness but is patient with you not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire,1
7182,2PE,3,NRSV,but the day of the lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the elements will be dissolved with fire and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,1
7183,2PE,3,NRSV,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire,why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister,1
7184,2PE,3,NRSV,but in accordance with his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth where righteousness is at home,the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective,1
7185,2PE,3,NRSV,therefore beloved while you are waiting for these things strive to be found by him at peace without spot or blemish and regard the patience of our lord as salvation,whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of god whoever serves must do so with the strength that god supplies so that god may be glorified in all things through jesus christ,1
7186,2PE,3,NRSV,so also our beloved brother paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him speaking of this as he does in all his letters,jesus said to her i am he the one who is speaking to you,1
7187,2PE,3,NRSV,there are some things in them hard to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures,the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in turmoil asking who is this,1
7188,2PE,3,NRSV,you therefore beloved since you are forewarned beware that you are not carried away with the error of the lawless and lose your own stability,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod had married her,1
7189,2PE,3,NRSV,but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ,they called out to ask whether simon who was called peter was staying there,1
7190,2PE,3,NRSV,to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,1
7191,1JN,1,NRSV,we declare to you what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life this life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it and declare to you the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ,thanks be to god for his indescribable gift,1
7192,1JN,1,NRSV,we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete,who are you to pass judgment on servants of another,1
7193,1JN,1,NRSV,this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all,then if anyone says to you look here is the messiah or there he isdo not believe it,1
7194,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves,1
7195,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master,1
7196,1JN,1,NRSV,if we confess our sins he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,when he had said this he died,1
7197,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,1
7198,1JN,2,NRSV,my little children i am writing these things to you so that you may not sin,and when they had taken their places and were eating jesus said truly i tell you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me,1
7199,1JN,2,NRSV,but if anyone does sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world,by faith the people passed through the red sea as if it were dry land but when the egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned,1
7200,1JN,2,NRSV,now by this we may be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments,when they asked him to stay longer he declined but on taking leave of them he said i will return to you if god wills,1
7201,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i have come to know him but does not obey his commandments is a liar and in such a person the truth does not exist but whoever obeys his word truly in this person the love of god has reached perfection,a second time he said to him simon son of john do you love me,1
7202,1JN,2,NRSV,by this we may be sure that we are in him whoever says i abide in him ought to walk just as he walked,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds he also adds i will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more,1
7203,1JN,2,NRSV,beloved i am writing you no new commandment but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word that you have heard,and out of pity for him the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt,1
7204,1JN,2,NRSV,yet i am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining,then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back sealed with seven seals and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals,1
7205,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i am in the light while hating a brother or sister is still in the darkness,the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here the queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but it finds none,1
7206,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,1
7207,1JN,2,NRSV,but whoever hates another believer is in the darkness walks in the darkness and does not know the way to go because the darkness has brought on blindness,then he said into what then were you baptized,1
7208,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you little children because your sins are forgiven on account of his name,for i see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness,1
7209,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you fathers because you know him who is from the beginning,so he summoned him and said to him what is this that i hear about you,1
7210,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you young people because you have conquered the evil one,and he added tell this to james and to the believers,1
7211,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you children because you know the father,he said to them the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest,1
7212,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you fathers because you know him who is from the beginning,just as you were once disobedient to god but have now received mercy because of their disobedience so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they too may now receive mercy,1
7213,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you young people because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the evil one,on the other hand those who prophesy speak to other people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation,1
7214,1JN,2,NRSV,do not love the world or the things in the world,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you,1
7215,1JN,2,NRSV,the love of the father is not in those who love the world for all that is in the worldthe desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes the pride in richescomes not from the father but from the world,and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on matthias and he was added to the eleven apostles,1
7216,1JN,2,NRSV,and the world and its desire are passing away but those who do the will of god live forever,if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other,1
7217,1JN,2,NRSV,children it is the last hour as you have heard that antichrist is coming so now many antichrists have come,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans,1
7218,1JN,2,NRSV,from this we know that it is the last hour,a crowd was sitting around him and they said to him your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside asking for you,1
7219,1JN,2,NRSV,they went out from us but they did not belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us,no one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs the soldiers aim is to please the enlisting officer,1
7220,1JN,2,NRSV,but by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us,he said to them but who do you say that i am,1
7221,1JN,2,NRSV,but you have been anointed by the holy one and all of you have knowledge,he led them out having performed wonders and signs in egypt at the red sea and in the wilderness for forty years,1
7222,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you know it and you know that no lie comes from the truth,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd,1
7223,1JN,2,NRSV,who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ,when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land,1
7224,1JN,2,NRSV,this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he,1
7225,1JN,2,NRSV,no one who denies the son has the father everyone who confesses the son has the father also,the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of you nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you,1
7226,1JN,2,NRSV,let what you heard from the beginning abide in you,so it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness,1
7227,1JN,2,NRSV,if what you heard from the beginning abides in you then you will abide in the son and in the father,when they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say for the holy spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say,1
7228,1JN,2,NRSV,and this is what he has promised us eternal life,and after it was sold were not the proceeds at your disposal,1
7229,1JN,2,NRSV,i write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me,1
7230,1JN,2,NRSV,as for you the anointing that you received from him abides in you and so you do not need anyone to teach you,peter also was standing with them and warming himself,1
7231,1JN,2,NRSV,but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie and just as it has taught you abide in him,he will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself,1
7232,1JN,2,NRSV,and now little children abide in him so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming,i write to you children because you know the father,1
7233,1JN,2,NRSV,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him,he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might come to have first place in everything,1
7234,1JN,3,NRSV,see what love the father has given us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are,this is the one who came by water and blood jesus christ not with the water only but with the water and the blood,1
7235,1JN,3,NRSV,the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him,from now on you do know him and have seen him,1
7236,1JN,3,NRSV,beloved we are gods children now what we will be has not yet been revealed,but martha was distracted by her many tasks so she came to him and asked lord do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself,1
7237,1JN,3,NRSV,what we do know is this when he is revealed we will be like him for we will see him as he is,so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring worries of its own,1
7238,1JN,3,NRSV,and all who have this hope in him purify themselves just as he is pure,then jesus went with them to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i go over there and pray,1
7239,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness sin is lawlessness,the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree,1
7240,1JN,3,NRSV,you know that he was revealed to take away sins and in him there is no sin,he sat down called the twelve and said to them whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all,1
7241,1JN,3,NRSV,no one who abides in him sins no one who sins has either seen him or known him,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away,1
7242,1JN,3,NRSV,little children let no one deceive you,and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me,1
7243,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous,jesus said to his disciples occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to anyone by whom they come it would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble,1
7244,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning,be merciful just as your father is merciful,1
7245,1JN,3,NRSV,the son of god was revealed for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers,1
7246,1JN,3,NRSV,those who have been born of god do not sin because gods seed abides in them they cannot sin because they have been born of god,and the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be amazed when they see the beast because it was and is not and is to come,1
7247,1JN,3,NRSV,the children of god and the children of the devil are revealed in this way all who do not do what is right are not from god nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters,they said this man is persuading people to worship god in ways that are contrary to the law,1
7248,1JN,3,NRSV,for this is the message you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,1
7249,1JN,3,NRSV,we must not be like cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from,1
7250,1JN,3,NRSV,and why did he murder him,but be alert i have already told you everything,1
7251,1JN,3,NRSV,because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous,truly i tell you wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her,1
7252,1JN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished brothers and sisters that the world hates you,i must bring them also and they will listen to my voice,1
7253,1JN,3,NRSV,we know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another,but when he heard that archelaus was ruling over judea in place of his father herod he was afraid to go there,1
7254,1JN,3,NRSV,whoever does not love abides in death,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,1
7255,1JN,3,NRSV,all who hate a brother or sister are murderers and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them,when day came the assembly of the elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they brought him to their council,1
7256,1JN,3,NRSV,we know love by this that he laid down his life for usand we ought to lay down our lives for one another,as for you the anointing that you received from him abides in you and so you do not need anyone to teach you,1
7257,1JN,3,NRSV,how does gods love abide in anyone who has the worlds goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed,1
7258,1JN,3,NRSV,little children let us love not in word or speech but in truth and action,but i replied by no means lord for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth,1
7259,1JN,3,NRSV,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything,jesus said to them come and have breakfast,1
7260,1JN,3,NRSV,beloved if our hearts do not condemn us we have boldness before god and we receive from him whatever we ask because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him,why then did you not put my money into the bank,1
7261,1JN,3,NRSV,and this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he has commanded us,pilate answered what i have written i have written,1
7262,1JN,3,NRSV,all who obey his commandments abide in him and he abides in them,her parents were astounded but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened,1
7263,1JN,3,NRSV,and by this we know that he abides in us by the spirit that he has given us,now concerning the matters about which you wrote it is well for a man not to touch a woman,1
7264,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god for many false prophets have gone out into the world,he laid his hands on saul and said brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on your way here has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the holy spirit,1
7265,1JN,4,NRSV,by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god,for we are not peddlers of gods word like so many but in christ we speak as persons of sincerity as persons sent from god and standing in his presence,1
7266,1JN,4,NRSV,and this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world,jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding,1
7267,1JN,4,NRSV,little children you are from god and have conquered them for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world,he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits,1
7268,1JN,4,NRSV,they are from the world therefore what they say is from the world and the world listens to them,what i am saying in regard to this boastful confidence i am saying not with the lords authority but as a fool since many boast according to human standards i will also boast,1
7269,1JN,4,NRSV,whoever knows god listens to us and whoever is not from god does not listen to us,it was declared at first through the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard him while god added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will,1
7270,1JN,4,NRSV,from this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying god forbid it lord this must never happen to you,1
7271,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved let us love one another because love is from god everyone who loves is born of god and knows god,for this reason i remind you to rekindle the gift of god that is within you through the laying on of my hands for god did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather a spirit of power and of love and of selfdiscipline,1
7272,1JN,4,NRSV,whoever does not love does not know god for god is love,i was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth namely how you walk in the truth,1
7273,1JN,4,NRSV,gods love was revealed among us in this way god sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him,three days after festus had arrived in the province he went up from caesarea to jerusalem where the chief priests and the leaders of the jews gave him a report against paul,1
7274,1JN,4,NRSV,in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins,no slave can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other,1
7275,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another,then i washed and now i see,1
7276,1JN,4,NRSV,no one has ever seen god if we love one another god lives in us and his love is perfected in us,he set this aside nailing it to the cross,1
7277,1JN,4,NRSV,by this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit,but jesus being aware that his disciples were complaining about it said to them does this offend you,1
7278,1JN,4,NRSV,and we have seen and do testify that the father has sent his son as the savior of the world,he will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1
7279,1JN,4,NRSV,god abides in those who confess that jesus is the son of god and they abide in god,and when you see the south wind blowing you say there will be scorching heat and it happens,1
7280,1JN,4,NRSV,so we have known and believe the love that god has for us,god finds fault with them when he says the days are surely coming says the lord when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not like the covenant that i made with their ancestors on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt for they did not continue in my covenant and so i had no concern for them says the lord,1
7281,1JN,4,NRSV,god is love and those who abide in love abide in god and god abides in them,be careful then how you live not as unwise people but as wise making the most of the time because the days are evil,1
7282,1JN,4,NRSV,love has been perfected among us in this that we may have boldness on the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world,for those who desire life and desire to see good days let them keep their tongues from evil and their lips from speaking deceit let them turn away from evil and do good let them seek peace and pursue it,1
7283,1JN,4,NRSV,there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love,then some of the scribes answered teacher you have spoken well,1
7284,1JN,4,NRSV,we love because he first loved us,but go tell his disciples and peter that he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him just as he told you,1
7285,1JN,4,NRSV,those who say i love god and hate their brothers or sisters are liars for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen cannot love god whom they have not seen,then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventyfive in all so jacob went down to egypt,1
7286,1JN,4,NRSV,the commandment we have from him is this those who love god must love their brothers and sisters also,the apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter,1
7287,1JN,5,NRSV,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child,you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess,1
7288,1JN,5,NRSV,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments,they paid him thirty pieces of silver,1
7289,1JN,5,NRSV,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1
7290,1JN,5,NRSV,and his commandments are not burdensome for whatever is born of god conquers the world,when they heard him addressing them in hebrew they became even more quiet,1
7291,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith,he called one of the slaves and asked what was going on,1
7292,1JN,5,NRSV,who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that jesus is the son of god,when they were approaching jerusalem at bethphage and bethany near the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it,1
7293,1JN,5,NRSV,this is the one who came by water and blood jesus christ not with the water only but with the water and the blood,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin he condemned sin in the flesh so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit,1
7294,1JN,5,NRSV,and the spirit is the one that testifies for the spirit is the truth,there is no fear of god before their eyes,1
7295,1JN,5,NRSV,there are three that testify the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike,1
7296,1JN,5,NRSV,if we receive human testimony the testimony of god is greater for this is the testimony of god that he has testified to his son,and her daughter was healed instantly,1
7297,1JN,5,NRSV,those who believe in the son of god have the testimony in their hearts,again he began to teach beside the sea,1
7298,1JN,5,NRSV,those who do not believe in god have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that god has given concerning his son,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together,1
7299,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son,and they had john also to assist them,1
7300,1JN,5,NRSV,whoever has the son has life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life,consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners so that you may not grow weary or lose heart,1
7301,1JN,5,NRSV,i write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life,but while he was still far off his father saw him and was filled with compassion he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him,1
7302,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the boldness we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us,now this was the second sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee,1
7303,1JN,5,NRSV,and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have obtained the requests made of him,then jesus ordered them to tell no one but the more he ordered them the more zealously they proclaimed it,1
7304,1JN,5,NRSV,if you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin you will ask and god will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal,take note i have told you beforehand,1
7305,1JN,5,NRSV,there is sin that is mortal i do not say that you should pray about that,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1
7306,1JN,5,NRSV,all wrongdoing is sin but there is sin that is not mortal,he said no father abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent,1
7307,1JN,5,NRSV,we know that those who are born of god do not sin but the one who was born of god protects them and the evil one does not touch them,then i saw the lamb open one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures call out as with a voice of thunder come i looked and there was a white horse its rider had a bow a crown was given to him and he came out conquering and to conquer,1
7308,1JN,5,NRSV,we know that we are gods children and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one,to this day i have had help from god and so i stand here testifying to both small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would take place that the messiah must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the gentiles,1
7309,1JN,5,NRSV,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,now after they had left an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream and said get up take the child and his mother and flee to egypt and remain there until i tell you for herod is about to search for the child to destroy him,1
7310,1JN,5,NRSV,he is the true god and eternal life,but they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his business while the rest seized his slaves mistreated them and killed them,1
7311,1JN,5,NRSV,little children keep yourselves from idols,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean,1
7312,2JN,1,NRSV,the elder to the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not only i but also all who know the truth because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the fathers son in truth and love,when the crowds saw what paul had done they shouted in the lycaonian language the gods have come down to us in human form barnabas they called zeus and paul they called hermes because he was the chief speaker,1
7313,2JN,1,NRSV,i was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth just as we have been commanded by the father,for in him every one of gods promises is a yes,1
7314,2JN,1,NRSV,but now dear lady i ask you not as though i were writing you a new commandment but one we have had from the beginning let us love one another,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from,1
7315,2JN,1,NRSV,and this is love that we walk according to his commandments this is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginningyou must walk in it,peter had followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting with the guards warming himself at the fire,1
7316,2JN,1,NRSV,many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist be on your guard so that you do not lose what we have worked for but may receive a full reward,then jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to cure every disease and every sickness,1
7317,2JN,1,NRSV,everyone who does not abide in the teaching of christ but goes beyond it does not have god whoever abides in the teaching has both the father and the son,i am the true vine and my father is the vinegrower,1
7318,2JN,1,NRSV,do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person,he said to them elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things,1
7319,2JN,1,NRSV,although i have much to write to you i would rather not use paper and ink instead i hope to come to you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete,let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready to her it has been granted to be clothed with fine linen bright and pure for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints,1
7320,2JN,1,NRSV,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings,now when simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money saying give me also this power so that anyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit,1
7321,3JN,1,NRSV,the elder to the beloved gaius whom i love in truth,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases,1
7322,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved i pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health just as it is well with your soul,for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins,1
7323,3JN,1,NRSV,i was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth namely how you walk in the truth,do you not say four months more then comes the harvest,1
7324,3JN,1,NRSV,i have no greater joy than this to hear that my children are walking in the truth,in those days mary set out and went with haste to a judean town in the hill country where she entered the house of zechariah and greeted elizabeth,1
7325,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends even though they are strangers to you they have testified to your love before the church,when he was abused he did not return abuse when he suffered he did not threaten but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly,1
7326,3JN,1,NRSV,you will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of god for they began their journey for the sake of christ accepting no support from nonbelievers,so take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents,1
7327,3JN,1,NRSV,therefore we ought to support such people so that we may become coworkers with the truth,now when they heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and to the other apostles brothers what should we do,1
7328,3JN,1,NRSV,i have written something to the church but diotrephes who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority,then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back sealed with seven seals and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals,1
7329,3JN,1,NRSV,so if i come i will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us,as he went a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john who were in their boat mending the nets,1
7330,3JN,1,NRSV,and not content with those charges he refuses to welcome the friends and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from the church,therefore i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for the sake of christ for whenever i am weak then i am strong,1
7331,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good,and he said to them have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food,1
7332,3JN,1,NRSV,whoever does good is from god whoever does evil has not seen god,a scribe then approached and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go,1
7333,3JN,1,NRSV,everyone has testified favorably about demetrius and so has the truth itself,then he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile,1
7334,3JN,1,NRSV,we also testify for him and you know that our testimony is true,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law,1
7335,3JN,1,NRSV,i have much to write to you but i would rather not write with pen and ink instead i hope to see you soon and we will talk together face to face,therefore since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god,1
7336,3JN,1,NRSV,the friends send you their greetings,but he said vehemently even though i must die with you i will not deny you,1
7337,3JN,1,NRSV,greet the friends there each by name,he said to them this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many,1
7338,JUD,1,NRSV,jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to those who are called who are beloved in god the father and kept safe for jesus christ may mercy peace and love be yours in abundance,now his elder son was in the field and when he came and approached the house he heard music and dancing,1
7339,JUD,1,NRSV,beloved while eagerly preparing to write to you about the salvation we share i find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints,and now i know that none of you among whom i have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will ever see my face again,1
7340,JUD,1,NRSV,for certain intruders have stolen in among you people who long ago were designated for this condemnation as ungodly who pervert the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,1
7341,JUD,1,NRSV,now i desire to remind you though you are fully informed that the lord who once for all saved a people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else,1
7342,JUD,1,NRSV,and the angels who did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day,they were allowed to torture them for five months but not to kill them and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone,1
7343,JUD,1,NRSV,likewise sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding cities which in the same manner as they indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire,a samaritan woman came to draw water and jesus said to her give me a drink,1
7344,JUD,1,NRSV,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones,but when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and get his inheritance,1

7452,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the word of god and for the testimony they had given they cried out with a loud voice sovereign lord holy and true how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth,they said to him are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat,1

7454,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the sixth seal i looked and there came a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale,the day was drawing to a close and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and get provisions for we are here in a deserted place,1
7455,REV,6,NRSV,the sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up and every mountain and island was removed from its place,but now with no further place for me in these regions i desire as i have for many years to come to you when i go to spain,1
7456,REV,6,NRSV,then the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the rich and the powerful and everyone slave and free hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains calling to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of their wrath has come and who is able to stand,that food sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything,1
7457,REV,7,NRSV,after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree,but jesus said someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me,1
7458,REV,7,NRSV,i saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun having the seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea saying do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have marked the servants of our god with a seal on their foreheads,or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk,1
7459,REV,7,NRSV,and i heard the number of those who were sealed one hundred fortyfour thousand sealed out of every tribe of the people of israel from the tribe of judah twelve thousand sealed from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand from the tribe of gad twelve thousand from the tribe of asher twelve thousand from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand from the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand from the tribe of levi twelve thousand from the tribe of issachar twelve thousand from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand from the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand sealed,you know him because he abides with you and he will be in you,1
7460,REV,7,NRSV,after this i looked and there was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation from all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and before the lamb robed in white with palm branches in their hands,all the churches of christ greet you,1
7461,REV,7,NRSV,they cried out in a loud voice saying salvation belongs to our god who is seated on the throne and to the lamb and all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped god singing amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our god forever and ever amen,i have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal,1
7462,REV,7,NRSV,then one of the elders addressed me saying who are these robed in white and where have they come from,has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use,1
7463,REV,7,NRSV,i said to him sir you are the one that knows,for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes,1
7464,REV,7,NRSV,then he said to me these are they who have come out of the great ordeal they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb,i want you to know beloved that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for christ and most of the brothers and sisters having been made confident in the lord by my imprisonment dare to speak the word with greater boldness and without fear,1
7465,REV,7,NRSV,for this reason they are before the throne of god and worship him day and night within his temple and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them,for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive,1
7466,REV,7,NRSV,they will hunger no more and thirst no more the sun will not strike them nor any scorching heat for the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd and he will guide them to springs of the water of life and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes,bear with one another and if anyone has a complaint against another forgive each other just as the lord has forgiven you so you also must forgive,1
7467,REV,8,NRSV,when the lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,1
7468,REV,8,NRSV,and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and seven trumpets were given to them,for what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our lord jesus at his coming,1
7469,REV,8,NRSV,another angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar he was given a great quantity of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that is before the throne,in this way god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets that his messiah would suffer,1
7470,REV,8,NRSV,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel,i made your name known to them and i will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them and i in them,1
7471,REV,8,NRSV,then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth and there were peals of thunder rumblings flashes of lightning and an earthquake,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate,1
7472,REV,8,NRSV,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them,to that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints,1
7473,REV,8,NRSV,the first angel blew his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and they were hurled to the earth and a third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up,he took him aside in private away from the crowd and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue,1
7474,REV,8,NRSV,the second angel blew his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea,peter also was standing with them and warming himself,1
7475,REV,8,NRSV,a third of the sea became blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed,this is the greatest and first commandment,1
7476,REV,8,NRSV,the third angel blew his trumpet and a great star fell from heaven blazing like a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water,moreover some women of our group astounded us,1
7477,REV,8,NRSV,the name of the star is wormwood,and the large crowd was listening to him with delight,1
7478,REV,8,NRSV,a third of the waters became wormwood and many died from the water because it was made bitter,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,1
7479,REV,8,NRSV,the fourth angel blew his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of their light was darkened a third of the day was kept from shining and likewise the night,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet,1
7480,REV,8,NRSV,then i looked and i heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew in midheaven woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow,when he said above you have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings these are offered according to the law then he added see i have come to do your will,1
7481,REV,9,NRSV,and the fifth angel blew his trumpet and i saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft,yes of gentiles also since god is one and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith,1
7482,REV,9,NRSV,then from the smoke came locusts on the earth and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth,indeed he has done nothing to deserve death,1
7483,REV,9,NRSV,they were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree but only those people who do not have the seal of god on their foreheads,then opening their treasure chests they offered him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh,1
7484,REV,9,NRSV,they were allowed to torture them for five months but not to kill them and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone,but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace,1
7485,REV,9,NRSV,and in those days people will seek death but will not find it they will long to die but death will flee from them,you snakes you brood of vipers how can you escape being sentenced to hell,1
7486,REV,9,NRSV,in appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle,if you are hungry eat at home so that when you come together it will not be for your condemnation,1
7487,REV,9,NRSV,on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold their faces were like human faces their hair like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth they had scales like iron breastplates and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle,he set this aside nailing it to the cross,1
7488,REV,9,NRSV,they have tails like scorpions with stingers and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months,meanwhile the people were waiting for zechariah and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary,1
7489,REV,9,NRSV,they have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit his name in hebrew is abaddon and in greek he is called apollyon,for though i am absent in body yet i am with you in spirit and i rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in christ,1
7490,REV,9,NRSV,there are still two woes to come,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming,1
7491,REV,9,NRSV,then the sixth angel blew his trumpet and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before god saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates,peter said to him even though all become deserters i will not,1
7492,REV,9,NRSV,so the four angels were released who had been held ready for the hour the day the month and the year to kill a third of humankind,then he said to him wrap your cloak around you and follow me,1
7493,REV,9,NRSV,the number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million i heard their number,now that day was a sabbath,1
7494,REV,9,NRSV,and this was how i saw the horses in my vision the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur the heads of the horses were like lions heads and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths,thus you will know them by their fruits,1
7495,REV,9,NRSV,by these three plagues a third of humankind was killed by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place,1
7496,REV,9,NRSV,for the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails their tails are like serpents having heads and with them they inflict harm,then i looked and i heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands singing with full voice worthy is the lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them singing to the one seated on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped,1
7497,REV,9,NRSV,the rest of humankind who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood which cannot see or hear or walk,he came from the jewish town of arimathea and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god,1
7498,REV,9,NRSV,and they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts,the elect obtained it but the rest were hardened as it is written god gave them a sluggish spirit eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear down to this very day,1
7499,REV,10,NRSV,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,and in the spirit he carried me away to a great high mountain and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god,1
7500,REV,10,NRSV,he held a little scroll open in his hand,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,1
7501,REV,10,NRSV,setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land he gave a great shout like a lion roaring,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank,1
7502,REV,10,NRSV,and when he shouted the seven thunders sounded,the young man said to him i have kept all these what do i still lack,1
7503,REV,10,NRSV,and when the seven thunders had sounded i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down,as he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving jericho bartimaeus son of timaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside,1
7504,REV,10,NRSV,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants the prophets,if any believing woman has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows,1
7505,REV,10,NRSV,then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,1
7506,REV,10,NRSV,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not enter yourselves and you hindered those who were entering,1
7507,REV,10,NRSV,so i took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it it was sweet as honey in my mouth but when i had eaten it my stomach was made bitter,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,1
7508,REV,10,NRSV,then they said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings,when the disciples reached the other side they had forgotten to bring any bread,1
7509,REV,11,NRSV,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months,and they will be upheld for the lord is able to make them stand,1
7510,REV,11,NRSV,and i will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days wearing sackcloth,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him and the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him,1
7511,REV,11,NRSV,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him,1
7512,REV,11,NRSV,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean,1
7513,REV,11,NRSV,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire,with what kind of body do they come,1
7514,REV,11,NRSV,when they have finished their testimony the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically called sodom and egypt where also their lord was crucified,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep,1
7515,REV,11,NRSV,for three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth,when they gathered the congregation together they delivered the letter,1
7516,REV,11,NRSV,but after the three and a half days the breath of life from god entered them and they stood on their feet and those who saw them were terrified,to this end we always pray for you asking that our god will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ,1
7517,REV,11,NRSV,then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them come up here and they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them,then i looked and there was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him were one hundred fortyfour thousand who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads,1
7518,REV,11,NRSV,at that moment there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the god of heaven,now at the time of the incense offering the whole assembly of the people was praying outside,1
7519,REV,11,NRSV,the third woe is coming very soon,after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem,1
7520,REV,11,NRSV,then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his messiah and he will reign forever and ever,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power,1
7521,REV,11,NRSV,then the twentyfour elders who sit on their thrones before god fell on their faces and worshiped god singing we give you thanks lord god almighty who are and who were for you have taken your great power and begun to reign,again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor and he said to him all these i will give you if you will fall down and worship me,1
7522,REV,11,NRSV,the nations raged but your wrath has come and the time for judging the dead for rewarding your servants the prophets and saints and all who fear your name both small and great and for destroying those who destroy the earth,then jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat and i do not want to send them away hungry for they might faint on the way,1
7523,REV,11,NRSV,then gods temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple and there were flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder an earthquake and heavy hail,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand,1
7524,REV,12,NRSV,a great portent appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove,1
7525,REV,12,NRSV,she was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs in the agony of giving birth,but the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him saying we do not want this man to rule over us,1
7526,REV,12,NRSV,then another portent appeared in heaven a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems on his heads,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,1
7527,REV,12,NRSV,his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth,now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary,1
7528,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born,so the word of the lord grew mightily and prevailed,1
7529,REV,12,NRSV,and she gave birth to a son a male child who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron,and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it,1
7530,REV,12,NRSV,but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days,when he had said this he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the mans eyes saying to him go wash in the pool of siloam which means sent,1
7531,REV,12,NRSV,and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon,he was his mothers only son and she was a widow and with her was a large crowd from the town,1
7532,REV,12,NRSV,the dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven,the whole assembly kept silence and listened to barnabas and paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that god had done through them among the gentiles,1
7533,REV,12,NRSV,the great dragon was thrown down that ancient serpent who is called the devil and satan the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain,1
7534,REV,12,NRSV,then i heard a loud voice in heaven proclaiming now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his messiah for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down who accuses them day and night before our god,so the other disciples told him we have seen the lord,1
7535,REV,12,NRSV,but they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony for they did not cling to life even in the face of death,as it is written the one who had much did not have too much and the one who had little did not have too little,1
7536,REV,12,NRSV,rejoice then you heavens and those who dwell in them but woe to the earth and the sea for the devil has come down to you with great wrath because he knows that his time is short so when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child,as he came near and saw the city he wept over it saying if you even you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace but now they are hidden from your eyes,1
7537,REV,12,NRSV,but the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness to her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time,this was the first registration and was taken while quirinius was governor of syria,1
7538,REV,12,NRSV,then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a river after the woman to sweep her away with the flood,therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that after we have examined him i may have something to write for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him,1
7539,REV,12,NRSV,but the earth came to the help of the woman it opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,1
7540,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her children those who keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus,then the one who had received the one talent also came forward saying master i knew that you were a harsh man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed so i was afraid and i went and hid your talent in the ground,1
7541,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore,he must manage his own household well keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how can he take care of gods church,1
7542,REV,13,NRSV,and i saw a beast rising out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on its horns were ten diadems and on its heads were blasphemous names,he said to them where is your faith,1
7543,REV,13,NRSV,and the beast that i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears and its mouth was like a lions mouth,i know what it is to have little and i know what it is to have plenty,1
7544,REV,13,NRSV,and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority,they appealed to him and requested as a favor to them against paul to have him transferred to jerusalem,1
7545,REV,13,NRSV,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound had been healed,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,1
7546,REV,13,NRSV,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast,as he went the crowds pressed in on him,1
7547,REV,13,NRSV,they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it,if we receive human testimony the testimony of god is greater for this is the testimony of god that he has testified to his son,1
7548,REV,13,NRSV,the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for fortytwo months,and he said to them how many loaves have you,1
7549,REV,13,NRSV,it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his dwelling that is those who dwell in heaven,by faith abel offered to god a more acceptable sacrifice than cains,1
7550,REV,13,NRSV,also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them,for god has put all things in subjection under his feet,1
7551,REV,13,NRSV,it was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that was slaughtered,he kept saying i am the man,1
7552,REV,13,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen if you are to be taken captive into captivity you go if you kill with the sword with the sword you must be killed,the lord be with all of you,1
7553,REV,13,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his,1
7554,REV,13,NRSV,then i saw another beast that rose out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon,thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him,1
7555,REV,13,NRSV,it exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound had been healed,i wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness,1
7556,REV,13,NRSV,it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast it deceives the inhabitants of earth telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed,in the presence of god who gives life to all things and of christ jesus who in his testimony before pontius pilate made the good confession i charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ which he will bring about at the right timehe who is the blessed and only sovereign the king of kings and lord of lords,1
7557,REV,13,NRSV,also it causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price,1
7558,REV,13,NRSV,this calls for wisdom let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a person,the dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven,1
7559,REV,13,NRSV,its number is six hundred sixtysix,he himself died there as well as our ancestors and their bodies were brought back to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem,1
7560,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him were one hundred fortyfour thousand who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god,1
7561,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder the voice i heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders,and after they had appointed elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had come to believe,1
7562,REV,14,NRSV,no one could learn that song except the one hundred fortyfour thousand who have been redeemed from the earth,and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth,1

7567,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a second followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer,1
7568,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest,1
7569,REV,14,NRSV,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,do not become idolaters as some of them did as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play,1
7570,REV,14,NRSV,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name,john said to him teacher we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he was not following us,1
7571,REV,14,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance of the saints those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of jesus,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first,1
7572,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord,now this was the second sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee,1
7573,REV,14,NRSV,yes says the spirit they will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them,but just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the spirit so it is now also,1
7574,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was a white cloud and seated on the cloud was one like the son of man with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand another angel came out of the temple calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud use your sickle and reap for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe,i give you a new commandment that you love one another,1
7575,REV,14,NRSV,so the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped,even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much again,1

7577,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel came out from the altar the angel who has authority over fire and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for its grapes are ripe,for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily and you have come to fullness in him who is the head of every ruler and authority,1
7578,REV,14,NRSV,so the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of god,god finds fault with them when he says the days are surely coming says the lord when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not like the covenant that i made with their ancestors on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt for they did not continue in my covenant and so i had no concern for them says the lord,1
7579,REV,14,NRSV,and the wine press was trodden outside the city and blood flowed from the wine press as high as a horses bridle for a distance of about two hundred miles,the pharisees said to him look why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,1

7584,REV,15,NRSV,after this i looked and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues robed in pure bright linen with golden sashes across their chests,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,1
7585,REV,15,NRSV,then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who lives forever and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended,it has happened to them according to the true proverb the dog turns back to its own vomit and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mud,1
7586,REV,16,NRSV,then i heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of god,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ,1
7587,REV,16,NRSV,so the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth and a foul and painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image,since that disciple was known to the high priest he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest but peter was standing outside at the gate,1
7588,REV,16,NRSV,the second angel poured his bowl into the sea and it became like the blood of a corpse and every living thing in the sea died,when he came to the other side to the country of the gadarenes two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him,1

7590,REV,16,NRSV,and i heard the angel of the waters say you are just o holy one who are and were for you have judged these things because they shed the blood of saints and prophets you have given them blood to drink,but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come,1
7591,REV,16,NRSV,it is what they deserve and i heard the altar respond yes o lord god the almighty your judgments are true and just the fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun and it was allowed to scorch them with fire they were scorched by the fierce heat but they cursed the name of god who had authority over these plagues and they did not repent and give him glory,when she saw peter warming himself she stared at him and said you also were with jesus the man from nazareth,1
7592,REV,16,NRSV,the fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast and its kingdom was plunged into darkness people gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and sores and they did not repent of their deeds,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons,1
7593,REV,16,NRSV,the sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east,beware of them for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them and the gentiles,1
7594,REV,16,NRSV,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet,a reed shaken by the wind,1

7597,REV,16,NRSV,the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a violent earthquake such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth so violent was that earthquake,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed,1

7602,REV,17,NRSV,so he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness and i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and it had seven heads and ten horns,do not be afraid little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom,1
7603,REV,17,NRSV,the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication and on her forehead was written a name a mystery babylon the great mother of whores and of earths abominations,you do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1
7604,REV,17,NRSV,and i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to jesus,but we have this treasure in clay jars so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to god and does not come from us,1

7628,REV,18,NRSV,and they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned crying out alas alas the great city where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth for in one hour she has been laid waste,while god has overlooked the times of human ignorance now he commands all people everywhere to repent because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead,1
