1593,MRK,14,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him and lead him away under guard,so when he came he went up to him at once and said rabbi and kissed him,0,MRK.14

1606,MRK,14,NRSV,for many gave false testimony against him and their testimony did not agree,some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another not made with hands,0,MRK.14

1611,MRK,14,NRSV,but he was silent and did not answer,but from the beginning of creation god made them male and female,1,MRK.14
1612,MRK,14,NRSV,again the high priest asked him are you the messiah the son of the blessed one,and day by day the lord added to their number those who were being saved,1,MRK.14

1623,MRK,14,NRSV,then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean,for christ did not please himself but as it is written the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me,1,MRK.14
1624,MRK,14,NRSV,but he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know this man you are talking about,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness,1,MRK.14
1625,MRK,14,NRSV,at that moment the cock crowed for the second time,then peter remembered that jesus had said to him before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times,0,MRK.14
1626,MRK,14,NRSV,then peter remembered that jesus had said to him before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times,thus he has given us through these things his precious and very great promises so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become participants of the divine nature,1,MRK.14
1627,MRK,14,NRSV,and he broke down and wept,as soon as it was morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council,0,MRK.14

1641,MRK,15,NRSV,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead,pilate spoke to them again then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the king of the jews,0,MRK.15

2568,LUK,20,NRSV,one day as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders and said to him tell us by what authority are you doing these things,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises,1,LUK.20
2569,LUK,20,NRSV,who is it who gave you this authority,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,0,LUK.20
2570,LUK,20,NRSV,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin,all of them said let him be crucified then he asked why what evil has he done,1,LUK.20

2573,LUK,20,NRSV,so they answered that they did not know where it came from,for it is from within from the human heart that evil intentions come fornication theft murder adultery avarice wickedness deceit licentiousness envy slander pride folly,1,LUK.20
2574,LUK,20,NRSV,then jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,you blind fools for which is greater the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred,1,LUK.20
2575,LUK,20,NRSV,he began to tell the people this parable a man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants and went to another country for a long time,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard but the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,0,LUK.20
2576,LUK,20,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard but the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded,0,LUK.20

2578,LUK,20,NRSV,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do,0,LUK.20
2579,LUK,20,NRSV,then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do,i will send my beloved son perhaps they will respect him,0,LUK.20

2581,LUK,20,NRSV,but when the tenants saw him they discussed it among themselves and said this is the heir let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours,so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,0,LUK.20
2582,LUK,20,NRSV,so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him,what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them,0,LUK.20
2583,LUK,20,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside,1,LUK.20
2584,LUK,20,NRSV,he will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others,when i remember you in my prayers i always thank my god because i hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the lord jesus,1,LUK.20

2587,LUK,20,NRSV,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,so they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest in order to trap him by what he said so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor,0,LUK.20
2588,LUK,20,NRSV,so they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest in order to trap him by what he said so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor,listen i will tell you a mystery we will not all die but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet,1,LUK.20
2589,LUK,20,NRSV,so they asked him teacher we know that you are right in what you say and teach and you show deference to no one but teach the way of god in accordance with truth,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,1,LUK.20
2590,LUK,20,NRSV,is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us,1,LUK.20
2591,LUK,20,NRSV,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them show me a denarius,and when i was with you and was in need i did not burden anyone for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from macedonia,1,LUK.20
2592,LUK,20,NRSV,whose head and whose title does it bear,he said to them then give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods,0,LUK.20
2593,LUK,20,NRSV,he said to them then give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god,1,LUK.20
2594,LUK,20,NRSV,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,some sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no children the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,0,LUK.20

2707,LUK,22,NRSV,then they said what further testimony do we need,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing see your house is left to you,1,LUK.22
2708,LUK,22,NRSV,we have heard it ourselves from his own lips,no you will be brought down to hades,1,LUK.22
2709,LUK,23,NRSV,then the assembly rose as a body and brought jesus before pilate,from them i also received letters to the brothers in damascus and i went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to jerusalem for punishment,1,LUK.23
2710,LUK,23,NRSV,they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor and saying that he himself is the messiah a king,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him,1,LUK.23
2711,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate asked him are you the king of the jews,then pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds i find no basis for an accusation against this man,0,LUK.23
2712,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds i find no basis for an accusation against this man,so the soldiers according to their instructions took paul and brought him during the night to antipatris,1,LUK.23
2713,LUK,23,NRSV,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean,0,LUK.23
2714,LUK,23,NRSV,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean,have you come to destroy us,1,LUK.23
2715,LUK,23,NRSV,and when he learned that he was under herods jurisdiction he sent him off to herod who was himself in jerusalem at that time,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign,0,LUK.23

2717,LUK,23,NRSV,he questioned him at some length but jesus gave him no answer,now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles,1,LUK.23
2718,LUK,23,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1,LUK.23
2719,LUK,23,NRSV,even herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him then he put an elegant robe on him and sent him back to pilate,that same day herod and pilate became friends with each other before this they had been enemies,0,LUK.23
2720,LUK,23,NRSV,that same day herod and pilate became friends with each other before this they had been enemies,pilate then called together the chief priests the leaders and the people and said to them you brought me this man as one who was perverting the people and here i have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him,0,LUK.23
2721,LUK,23,NRSV,pilate then called together the chief priests the leaders and the people and said to them you brought me this man as one who was perverting the people and here i have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him,but when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy and blaspheming they contradicted what was spoken by paul,1,LUK.23
2722,LUK,23,NRSV,neither has herod for he sent him back to us,indeed he has done nothing to deserve death,0,LUK.23
2723,LUK,23,NRSV,indeed he has done nothing to deserve death,i will therefore have him flogged and release him,0,LUK.23
2724,LUK,23,NRSV,i will therefore have him flogged and release him,then they all shouted out together away with this fellow release barabbas for us this was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city and for murder pilate wanting to release jesus addressed them again but they kept shouting crucify crucify him a third time he said to them why what evil has he done,0,LUK.23

2727,LUK,23,NRSV,but they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified and their voices prevailed,he did not want anyone to know it for he was teaching his disciples saying to them the son of man is to be betrayed into human hands and they will kill him and three days after being killed he will rise again,1,LUK.23
2728,LUK,23,NRSV,so pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted,he released the man they asked for the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder and he handed jesus over as they wished,0,LUK.23
2729,LUK,23,NRSV,he released the man they asked for the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder and he handed jesus over as they wished,those who are ashamed of me and of my words of them the son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels,1,LUK.23
2730,LUK,23,NRSV,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,a great number of the people followed him and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him,0,LUK.23
2731,LUK,23,NRSV,a great number of the people followed him and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him,but refuse to put younger widows on the list for when their sensual desires alienate them from christ they want to marry and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge,1,LUK.23
2732,LUK,23,NRSV,but jesus turned to them and said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,for the days are surely coming when they will say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed,0,LUK.23
2733,LUK,23,NRSV,for the days are surely coming when they will say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed,then they will begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us,0,LUK.23
2734,LUK,23,NRSV,then they will begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us,how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt,1,LUK.23
2735,LUK,23,NRSV,for if they do this when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry,two others also who were criminals were led away to be put to death with him,0,LUK.23

2737,LUK,23,NRSV,when they came to the place that is called the skull they crucified jesus there with the criminals one on his right and one on his left, then jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they cast lots to divide his clothing,0,LUK.23
2738,LUK,23,NRSV, then jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they cast lots to divide his clothing,but when god who had set me apart before i was born and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me so that i might proclaim him among the gentiles i did not confer with any human being nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me but i went away at once into arabia and afterwards i returned to damascus,1,LUK.23
2739,LUK,23,NRSV,and the people stood by watching but the leaders scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the messiah of god his chosen one the soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself there was also an inscription over him this is the king of the jews,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it,1,LUK.23
2740,LUK,23,NRSV,one of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying are you not the messiah,and wherever he went into villages or cities or farms they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed,1,LUK.23
2741,LUK,23,NRSV,save yourself and us but the other rebuked him saying do you not fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation,simon peter said to him lord where are you going,1,LUK.23
2742,LUK,23,NRSV,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong,a reed shaken by the wind,1,LUK.23
2743,LUK,23,NRSV,then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom,he replied truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise,0,LUK.23
2744,LUK,23,NRSV,he replied truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ,1,LUK.23
2745,LUK,23,NRSV,it was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon while the suns light failed and the curtain of the temple was torn in two,he said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at capernaum,1,LUK.23
2746,LUK,23,NRSV,then jesus crying with a loud voice said father into your hands i commend my spirit,having said this he breathed his last,0,LUK.23
2747,LUK,23,NRSV,having said this he breathed his last,you are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that god gave to your ancestors saying to abraham and in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed,1,LUK.23
2748,LUK,23,NRSV,when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised god and said certainly this man was innocent,and when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place they returned home beating their breasts,0,LUK.23
2749,LUK,23,NRSV,and when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place they returned home beating their breasts,fearing that we might run on the rocks they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come,1,LUK.23

2751,LUK,23,NRSV,now there was a good and righteous man named joseph who though a member of the council had not agreed to their plan and action,i say this to your shame,1,LUK.23
2752,LUK,23,NRSV,he came from the jewish town of arimathea and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god,in the morning they did not recognize the land but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if they could,1,LUK.23
2753,LUK,23,NRSV,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,then festus gave the order and paul was brought in,1,LUK.23
2754,LUK,23,NRSV,then he took it down wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a rockhewn tomb where no one had ever been laid,do this in remembrance of me,1,LUK.23
2755,LUK,23,NRSV,it was the day of preparation and the sabbath was beginning,when jesus said to them i am he they stepped back and fell to the ground,1,LUK.23
2756,LUK,23,NRSV,the women who had come with him from galilee followed and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me,1,LUK.23
2757,LUK,23,NRSV,then they returned and prepared spices and ointments,when i was with you day after day in the temple you did not lay hands on me,1,LUK.23
2758,LUK,23,NRSV,on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons,1,LUK.23
2804,JHN,1,NRSV,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,he was in the beginning with god,0,JHN.1
2805,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the beginning with god,therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away and tell the people he has been raised from the dead and the last deception would be worse than the first,1,JHN.1
2806,JHN,1,NRSV,all things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being,what has come into being in him was life and the life was the light of all people,0,JHN.1
2807,JHN,1,NRSV,what has come into being in him was life and the life was the light of all people,the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it,0,JHN.1
2808,JHN,1,NRSV,the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it,instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain jesus who had died but whom paul asserted to be alive,1,JHN.1
2809,JHN,1,NRSV,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,he came as a witness to testify to the light so that all might believe through him,0,JHN.1
2810,JHN,1,NRSV,he came as a witness to testify to the light so that all might believe through him,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling,1,JHN.1
2811,JHN,1,NRSV,he himself was not the light but he came to testify to the light,they answered if this man were not a criminal we would not have handed him over to you,1,JHN.1
2812,JHN,1,NRSV,the true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world,are you not my work in the lord,1,JHN.1

2814,JHN,1,NRSV,he came to what was his own and his own people did not accept him,i tell you something greater than the temple is here,1,JHN.1
2815,JHN,1,NRSV,but to all who received him who believed in his name he gave power to become children of god who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god,then his mother and his brothers came to him but they could not reach him because of the crowd,1,JHN.1
2816,JHN,1,NRSV,and the word became flesh and lived among us and we have seen his glory the glory as of a fathers only son full of grace and truth,i told them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge,1,JHN.1
2817,JHN,1,NRSV,john testified to him and cried out this was he of whom i said he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me,therefore let us go on toward perfection leaving behind the basic teaching about christ and not laying again the foundation repentance from dead works and faith toward god instruction about baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment,1,JHN.1
2818,JHN,1,NRSV, from his fullness we have all received grace upon grace,the law indeed was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ,0,JHN.1
2819,JHN,1,NRSV,the law indeed was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ,what then did you go out to see,1,JHN.1
2820,JHN,1,NRSV,no one has ever seen god,for we ourselves were once foolish disobedient led astray slaves to various passions and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy despicable hating one another,1,JHN.1
2821,JHN,1,NRSV,it is god the only son who is close to the fathers heart who has made him known,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right,1,JHN.1
2822,JHN,1,NRSV,this is the testimony given by john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who are you,others have labored and you have entered into their labor,1,JHN.1
2823,JHN,1,NRSV,he confessed and did not deny it but confessed i am not the messiah,and they asked him what then,0,JHN.1

2826,JHN,1,NRSV,let us have an answer for those who sent us,what do you say about yourself,0,JHN.1
2827,JHN,1,NRSV,what do you say about yourself,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months,1,JHN.1

2831,JHN,1,NRSV,john answered them i baptize with water,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions,1,JHN.1
2832,JHN,1,NRSV,among you stands one whom you do not know the one who is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal,children obey your parents in everything for this is your acceptable duty in the lord,1,JHN.1
2833,JHN,1,NRSV,this took place in bethany across the jordan where john was baptizing,the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and declared here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me,0,JHN.1
2834,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and declared here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me,but how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed,1,JHN.1
2835,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but i came baptizing with water for this reason that he might be revealed to israel,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him,0,JHN.1
2836,JHN,1,NRSV,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be,1,JHN.1
2837,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you see the spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the holy spirit,and i myself have seen and have testified that this is the son of god,0,JHN.1
2838,JHN,1,NRSV,and i myself have seen and have testified that this is the son of god,he said to the jews here is your king they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate asked them shall i crucify your king,1,JHN.1
2839,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for,0,JHN.1
2840,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for,for this reason i said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you,1,JHN.1
2841,JHN,1,NRSV,they said to him rabbi which translated means teacher where are you staying,in him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ when you were buried with him in baptism you were also raised with him through faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead,1,JHN.1
2842,JHN,1,NRSV,he said to them come and see,they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day,0,JHN.1
2843,JHN,1,NRSV,they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day,it was about four oclock in the afternoon,0,JHN.1
2844,JHN,1,NRSV,it was about four oclock in the afternoon,i tell you i will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,1,JHN.1
2845,JHN,1,NRSV,one of the two who heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother,and they took them out and asked them to leave the city,1,JHN.1
2846,JHN,1,NRSV,he first found his brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated anointed ,he brought simon to jesus who looked at him and said you are simon son of john,0,JHN.1
2847,JHN,1,NRSV,he brought simon to jesus who looked at him and said you are simon son of john,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,0,JHN.1
2848,JHN,1,NRSV,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,i am not aware of anything against myself but i am not thereby acquitted,1,JHN.1
2849,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day jesus decided to go to galilee,when pilate heard these words he brought jesus outside and sat on the judges bench at a place called the stone pavement or in hebrew gabbatha,1,JHN.1
2850,JHN,1,NRSV,he found philip and said to him follow me,but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at his coming those who belong to christ,1,JHN.1
2851,JHN,1,NRSV,now philip was from bethsaida the city of andrew and peter,i thank god that i baptized none of you except crispus and gaius so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name,1,JHN.1
2852,JHN,1,NRSV,philip found nathanael and said to him we have found him about whom moses in the law and also the prophets wrote jesus son of joseph from nazareth,you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,1,JHN.1
2853,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael said to him can anything good come out of nazareth,the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem,1,JHN.1
2854,JHN,1,NRSV,philip said to him come and see,so he went in to stay with them,1,JHN.1
2855,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus saw nathanael coming toward him he said of him here is truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit nathanael asked him where did you get to know me,but jesus aware of this said to them why do you trouble the woman,1,JHN.1
2856,JHN,1,NRSV,jesus answered i saw you under the fig tree before philip called you,nathanael replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel jesus answered do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree,0,JHN.1
2857,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel jesus answered do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree,you will see greater things than these,0,JHN.1
2858,JHN,1,NRSV,you will see greater things than these,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,0,JHN.1
2859,JHN,1,NRSV,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,when they had brought them they had them stand before the council,1,JHN.1
2886,JHN,3,NRSV,now there was a pharisee named nicodemus a leader of the jews,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist,1,JHN.3
2887,JHN,3,NRSV,he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god,jesus answered him very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above,0,JHN.3
2888,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above,however so that we do not give offense to them go to the sea and cast a hook take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a coin take that and give it to them for you and me,1,JHN.3
2889,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can anyone be born after having grown old,they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate in their presence,1,JHN.3
2890,JHN,3,NRSV,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,and in his name the gentiles will hope,1,JHN.3
2891,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit,0,JHN.3
2892,JHN,3,NRSV,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,1,JHN.3
2893,JHN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished that i said to you you must be born from above,now a bishop must be above reproach married only once temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money,1,JHN.3
2894,JHN,3,NRSV,the wind blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes,we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies,1,JHN.3
2895,JHN,3,NRSV,so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit,nicodemus said to him how can these things be,0,JHN.3
2896,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can these things be,jesus answered him are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things,0,JHN.3

4916,ROM,3,NRSV,for no human being will be justified in his sight by deeds prescribed by the law for through the law comes the knowledge of sin,also some epicurean and stoic philosophers debated with him,1,ROM.3
4917,ROM,3,NRSV,but now apart from law the righteousness of god has been disclosed and is attested by the law and the prophets the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe,we are even found to be misrepresenting god because we testified of god that he raised christwhom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised,1,ROM.3
4918,ROM,3,NRSV,for there is no distinction since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god they are now justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood effective through faith,he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus,0,ROM.3
4919,ROM,3,NRSV,he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus,her parents were astounded but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened,1,ROM.3
4920,ROM,3,NRSV,no but by the law of faith,for we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law,0,ROM.3
4921,ROM,3,NRSV,for we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law,or is god the god of jews only,0,ROM.3

4924,ROM,3,NRSV,yes of gentiles also since god is one and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith,while paul was waiting for them in athens he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols,1,ROM.3
4925,ROM,3,NRSV,do we then overthrow the law by this faith,by no means on the contrary we uphold the law,0,ROM.3
4926,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means on the contrary we uphold the law,the city lies foursquare its length the same as its width and he measured the city with his rod fifteen hundred miles its length and width and height are equal,1,ROM.3
4927,ROM,4,NRSV,what then are we to say was gained by abraham our ancestor according to the flesh,you sent messengers to john and he testified to the truth,1,ROM.4
4928,ROM,4,NRSV,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god,for what does the scripture say,0,ROM.4
4929,ROM,4,NRSV,for what does the scripture say,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,0,ROM.4
4930,ROM,4,NRSV,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,and i will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days wearing sackcloth,1,ROM.4
4931,ROM,4,NRSV,now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him,1,ROM.4
4932,ROM,4,NRSV,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,1,ROM.4
4933,ROM,4,NRSV,so also david speaks of the blessedness of those to whom god reckons righteousness apart from works blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the one against whom the lord will not reckon sin,if timothy comes see that he has nothing to fear among you for he is doing the work of the lord just as i am therefore let no one despise him,1,ROM.4
4934,ROM,4,NRSV,is this blessedness then pronounced only on the circumcised or also on the uncircumcised,we say faith was reckoned to abraham as righteousness,0,ROM.4
4935,ROM,4,NRSV,we say faith was reckoned to abraham as righteousness,how then was it reckoned to him,0,ROM.4
4936,ROM,4,NRSV,how then was it reckoned to him,just as it was in the days of noah so too it will be in the days of the son of man,1,ROM.4
4937,ROM,4,NRSV,was it before or after he had been circumcised,and he went away and began to proclaim in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed,1,ROM.4
4938,ROM,4,NRSV,it was not after but before he was circumcised,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,0,ROM.4
4939,ROM,4,NRSV,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,so when the samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days,1,ROM.4
4940,ROM,4,NRSV,the purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor abraham had before he was circumcised,and he will send them immediately,1,ROM.4
4941,ROM,4,NRSV,for the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith,and all the churches will know that i am the one who searches minds and hearts and i will give to each of you as your works deserve,1,ROM.4
4942,ROM,4,NRSV,if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void,for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years,1,ROM.4
4943,ROM,4,NRSV,for the law brings wrath but where there is no law neither is there violation,as in all the churches of the saints women should be silent in the churches,1,ROM.4
4944,ROM,4,NRSV,for this reason it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of abraham for he is the father of all of us as it is written i have made you the father of many nationsin the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist,see to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition according to the elemental spirits of the universe and not according to christ,1,ROM.4
4945,ROM,4,NRSV,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be,so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief,1,ROM.4
4946,ROM,4,NRSV,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb,no distrust made him waver concerning the promise of god but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to god being fully convinced that god was able to do what he had promised,0,ROM.4
4947,ROM,4,NRSV,no distrust made him waver concerning the promise of god but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to god being fully convinced that god was able to do what he had promised,therefore his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness,0,ROM.4
4948,ROM,4,NRSV,therefore his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace,1,ROM.4
4949,ROM,4,NRSV,now the words it was reckoned to him were written not for his sake alone but for ours also,it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification,0,ROM.4
4950,ROM,4,NRSV,it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing,1,ROM.4
4951,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god,and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us,0,ROM.5
4952,ROM,5,NRSV,and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us,for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly,0,ROM.5
4953,ROM,5,NRSV,for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly,and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,1,ROM.5
4954,ROM,5,NRSV,indeed rarely will anyone die for a righteous personthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die,all must test their own work then that work rather than their neighbors work will become a cause for pride,1,ROM.5
4955,ROM,5,NRSV,but god proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners christ died for us,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean,1,ROM.5
4956,ROM,5,NRSV,much more surely then now that we have been justified by his blood will we be saved through him from the wrath of god,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life,0,ROM.5
4957,ROM,5,NRSV,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life,and i said lord they themselves know that in every synagogue i imprisoned and beat those who believed in you,1,ROM.5
4958,ROM,5,NRSV,but more than that we even boast in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables,1,ROM.5
4959,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and death came through sin and so death spread to all because all have sinned sin was indeed in the world before the law but sin is not reckoned when there is no law,yet death exercised dominion from adam to moses even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of adam who is a type of the one who was to come,0,ROM.5
4960,ROM,5,NRSV,yet death exercised dominion from adam to moses even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of adam who is a type of the one who was to come,but the free gift is not like the trespass,0,ROM.5
4961,ROM,5,NRSV,but the free gift is not like the trespass,for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many,0,ROM.5
4962,ROM,5,NRSV,for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many,if your brother or sister is being injured by what you eat you are no longer walking in love,1,ROM.5
4963,ROM,5,NRSV,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,0,ROM.5
4964,ROM,5,NRSV,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,but someone has testified somewhere what are human beings that you are mindful of them or mortals that you care for them,1,ROM.5
4965,ROM,5,NRSV,if because of the one mans trespass death exercised dominion through that one much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man jesus christ,therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all,0,ROM.5
4966,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all,for just as by the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one mans obedience the many will be made righteous,0,ROM.5
4967,ROM,5,NRSV,for just as by the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one mans obedience the many will be made righteous,but law came in with the result that the trespass multiplied but where sin increased grace abounded all the more so that just as sin exercised dominion in death so grace might also exercise dominion through justification leading to eternal life through jesus christ our lord,0,ROM.5
4968,ROM,5,NRSV,but law came in with the result that the trespass multiplied but where sin increased grace abounded all the more so that just as sin exercised dominion in death so grace might also exercise dominion through justification leading to eternal life through jesus christ our lord,i will put my spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles,1,ROM.5
4969,ROM,6,NRSV,what then are we to say,should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound,0,ROM.6
4970,ROM,6,NRSV,should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,0,ROM.6
4971,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come,1,ROM.6
4972,ROM,6,NRSV,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death,therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life,0,ROM.6
4973,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his,0,ROM.6
4974,ROM,6,NRSV,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his,see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven,1,ROM.6
4975,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed and we might no longer be enslaved to sin,for whoever has died is freed from sin,0,ROM.6
4976,ROM,6,NRSV,for whoever has died is freed from sin,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him,0,ROM.6
4977,ROM,6,NRSV,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him,we know that christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him,0,ROM.6
4978,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him,the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god,0,ROM.6
4979,ROM,6,NRSV,the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god,he answered the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me,1,ROM.6
4980,ROM,6,NRSV,so you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to god in christ jesus,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit,1,ROM.6
4981,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies to make you obey their passions,those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing,1,ROM.6
4982,ROM,6,NRSV,no longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness but present yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and present your members to god as instruments of righteousness,and his disciples approached him saying explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field,1,ROM.6
4983,ROM,6,NRSV,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace,should we sin because we are not under law but under grace,0,ROM.6
4984,ROM,6,NRSV,should we sin because we are not under law but under grace,but know this if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he would not have let his house be broken into,1,ROM.6
4985,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness,but thanks be to god that you having once been slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted and that you having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness,0,ROM.6
4986,ROM,6,NRSV,but thanks be to god that you having once been slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted and that you having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness,but a pharisee in the council named gamaliel a teacher of the law respected by all the people stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time,1,ROM.6
4987,ROM,6,NRSV,i am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations,it is for this hope your excellency that i am accused by jews why is it thought incredible by any of you that god raises the dead,1,ROM.6
4988,ROM,6,NRSV,for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification,when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness,0,ROM.6
4989,ROM,6,NRSV,when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness,i will write on you the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem that comes down from my god out of heaven and my own new name,1,ROM.6
4990,ROM,6,NRSV,so what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed,but peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them men of judea and all who live in jerusalem let this be known to you and listen to what i say,1,ROM.6
4991,ROM,6,NRSV,the end of those things is death,but now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to god the advantage you get is sanctification,0,ROM.6
4992,ROM,6,NRSV,but now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to god the advantage you get is sanctification,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,0,ROM.6
4993,ROM,6,NRSV,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,and he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down,1,ROM.6
4994,ROM,7,NRSV,do you not know brothers and sisters for i am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only during that persons lifetime,thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband,0,ROM.7
4995,ROM,7,NRSV,thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband,therefore knowing the fear of the lord we try to persuade others but we ourselves are well known to god and i hope that we are also well known to your consciences,1,ROM.7
4996,ROM,7,NRSV,accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive,for in him we live and move and have our being as even some of your own poets have said for we too are his offspring,1,ROM.7
4997,ROM,7,NRSV,but if her husband dies she is free from that law and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress,in the same way my friends you have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god,0,ROM.7
4998,ROM,7,NRSV,in the same way my friends you have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god,while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death,0,ROM.7
4999,ROM,7,NRSV,while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit,0,ROM.7
5000,ROM,7,NRSV,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit,and this is the boldness we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us,1,ROM.7
5001,ROM,7,NRSV,by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin,i would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet,0,ROM.7
5002,ROM,7,NRSV,i would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet,for if those who are nothing think they are something they deceive themselves,1,ROM.7
5003,ROM,7,NRSV,but sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness,but all this has taken place so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled,1,ROM.7
5004,ROM,7,NRSV,apart from the law sin lies dead,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1,ROM.7
5005,ROM,7,NRSV,i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me,for sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment deceived me and through it killed me,0,ROM.7
5006,ROM,7,NRSV,for sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment deceived me and through it killed me,as he was going down his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive,1,ROM.7
5007,ROM,7,NRSV,so the law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good,he came to what was his own and his own people did not accept him,1,ROM.7
5008,ROM,7,NRSV,did what is good then bring death to me,by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure,0,ROM.7
5009,ROM,7,NRSV,by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold into slavery under sin,0,ROM.7
5010,ROM,7,NRSV,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold into slavery under sin,whoever speaks evil against another or judges another speaks evil against the law and judges the law but if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge,1,ROM.7
5011,ROM,7,NRSV,i do not understand my own actions,so you also on the outside look righteous to others but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness,1,ROM.7
5012,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do what i want but i do the very thing i hate,how great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire and the tongue is a fire,1,ROM.7
5013,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good,but in fact it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me,0,ROM.7
5014,ROM,7,NRSV,but in fact it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me,but whenever you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you,1,ROM.7
5015,ROM,7,NRSV,for i know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh,then they returned and prepared spices and ointments,1,ROM.7
5016,ROM,7,NRSV,i can will what is right but i cannot do it,and they said some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets,1,ROM.7
5017,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do the good i want but the evil i do not want is what i do,and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah,1,ROM.7
5018,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,0,ROM.7
5019,ROM,7,NRSV,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,then they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name,1,ROM.7
5020,ROM,7,NRSV,for i delight in the law of god in my inmost self but i see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members,he gave her his hand and helped her up,1,ROM.7
5021,ROM,7,NRSV,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death,thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then with my mind i am a slave to the law of god but with my flesh i am a slave to the law of sin,0,ROM.7
5022,ROM,7,NRSV,thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then with my mind i am a slave to the law of god but with my flesh i am a slave to the law of sin,there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus,0,ROM.7

5024,ROM,8,NRSV,for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin he condemned sin in the flesh so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit,0,ROM.8
5025,ROM,8,NRSV,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin he condemned sin in the flesh so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit,now it was the day of preparation for the passover and it was about noon,1,ROM.8
5026,ROM,8,NRSV,for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit,i do not even judge myself,1,ROM.8
5027,ROM,8,NRSV,to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace,for this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods lawindeed it cannot and those who are in the flesh cannot please god,0,ROM.8
5028,ROM,8,NRSV,for this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods lawindeed it cannot and those who are in the flesh cannot please god,or what king going out to wage war against another king will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand,1,ROM.8
5029,ROM,8,NRSV,but you are not in the flesh you are in the spirit since the spirit of god dwells in you,let your word be yes yes or no no anything more than this comes from the evil one,1,ROM.8
5030,ROM,8,NRSV,anyone who does not have the spirit of christ does not belong to him,for we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty,1,ROM.8
5031,ROM,8,NRSV,but if christ is in you though the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit that dwells in you,0,ROM.8
5032,ROM,8,NRSV,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit that dwells in you,so then brothers and sisters we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live,0,ROM.8
5033,ROM,8,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god,0,ROM.8
5034,ROM,8,NRSV,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god,for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive,1,ROM.8
5035,ROM,8,NRSV,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption,when we cry abba father it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him,0,ROM.8
5036,ROM,8,NRSV,when we cry abba father it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him,now the men who were holding jesus began to mock him and beat him they also blindfolded him and kept asking him prophesy who is it that struck you,1,ROM.8
5037,ROM,8,NRSV,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us,for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god,0,ROM.8
5038,ROM,8,NRSV,for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god,then jesus said there was a man who had two sons,1,ROM.8
5039,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies,just so i tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents,1,ROM.8
5040,ROM,8,NRSV,for in hope we were saved,she had heard about jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak for she said if i but touch his clothes i will be made well,1,ROM.8
5041,ROM,8,NRSV,now hope that is seen is not hope,for who hopes for what is seen,0,ROM.8
5042,ROM,8,NRSV,for who hopes for what is seen,but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience,0,ROM.8
5043,ROM,8,NRSV,but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience,whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you eat what is set before you cure the sick who are there and say to them the kingdom of god has come near to you,1,ROM.8
5044,ROM,8,NRSV,likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but that very spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words,and god who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god,0,ROM.8
5045,ROM,8,NRSV,and god who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god,we know that all things work together for good for those who love god who are called according to his purpose,0,ROM.8

5048,ROM,8,NRSV,and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,1,ROM.8
5049,ROM,8,NRSV,what then are we to say about these things,if god is for us who is against us,0,ROM.8
5050,ROM,8,NRSV,if god is for us who is against us,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else,0,ROM.8
5051,ROM,8,NRSV,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else,who will bring any charge against gods elect,0,ROM.8

5060,ROM,9,NRSV,for i could wish that i myself were accursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my own people my kindred according to the flesh,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace,1,ROM.9

5062,ROM,9,NRSV,it is not as though the word of god had failed,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith,1,ROM.9
5063,ROM,9,NRSV,for not all israelites truly belong to israel and not all of abrahams children are his true descendants but it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you,this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of god but the children of the promise are counted as descendants,0,ROM.9

5086,ROM,9,NRSV,gentiles who did not strive for righteousness have attained it that is righteousness through faith but israel who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law did not succeed in fulfilling that law,because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith but as if it were based on works,0,ROM.9

5267,1CO,1,NRSV,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ,god is faithful by him you were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord,0,1CO.1
5268,1CO,1,NRSV,god is faithful by him you were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord,now i appeal to you brothers and sisters by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose,0,1CO.1
5269,1CO,1,NRSV,now i appeal to you brothers and sisters by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters,0,1CO.1
5270,1CO,1,NRSV,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters,what i mean is that each of you says i belong to paul or i belong to apollos or i belong to cephas or i belong to christ,0,1CO.1
5271,1CO,1,NRSV,what i mean is that each of you says i belong to paul or i belong to apollos or i belong to cephas or i belong to christ,when he said above you have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings these are offered according to the law then he added see i have come to do your will,1,1CO.1
5272,1CO,1,NRSV,or were you baptized in the name of paul,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace,1,1CO.1
5273,1CO,1,NRSV,i thank god that i baptized none of you except crispus and gaius so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power,0,1CO.1
5274,1CO,1,NRSV,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power,for the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god,0,1CO.1
5275,1CO,1,NRSV,for the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart,0,1CO.1
5276,1CO,1,NRSV,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart,but someone will ask how are the dead raised,1,1CO.1
5277,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the one who is wise,where is the debater of this age,0,1CO.1
5278,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the debater of this age,blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe,1,1CO.1
5279,1CO,1,NRSV,has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world,give us each day our daily bread,1,1CO.1
5280,1CO,1,NRSV,for since in the wisdom of god the world did not know god through wisdom god decided through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe,for jews demand signs and greeks desire wisdom but we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles but to those who are the called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god,0,1CO.1
5281,1CO,1,NRSV,for jews demand signs and greeks desire wisdom but we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles but to those who are the called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god,neither has herod for he sent him back to us,1,1CO.1
5282,1CO,1,NRSV,for gods foolishness is wiser than human wisdom and gods weakness is stronger than human strength,consider your own call brothers and sisters not many of you were wise by human standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth,0,1CO.1
5283,1CO,1,NRSV,consider your own call brothers and sisters not many of you were wise by human standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth,the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john who testified to the word of god and to the testimony of jesus christ even to all that he saw,1,1CO.1
5284,1CO,1,NRSV,but god chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise god chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong god chose what is low and despised in the world things that are not to reduce to nothing things that are so that no one might boast in the presence of god,he is the source of your life in christ jesus who became for us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption in order that as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lord,0,1CO.1
5285,1CO,1,NRSV,he is the source of your life in christ jesus who became for us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption in order that as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lord,but others sneered and said they are filled with new wine,1,1CO.1
5286,1CO,2,NRSV,when i came to you brothers and sisters i did not come proclaiming the mystery of god to you in lofty words or wisdom,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified,0,1CO.2
5287,1CO,2,NRSV,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,0,1CO.2
5288,1CO,2,NRSV,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of god,0,1CO.2
5289,1CO,2,NRSV,my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of god,then another angel came out of the temple in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle,1,1CO.2
5290,1CO,2,NRSV,yet among the mature we do speak wisdom though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are doomed to perish,jesus answered them this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent,1,1CO.2
5291,1CO,2,NRSV,but we speak gods wisdom secret and hidden which god decreed before the ages for our glory,none of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory,0,1CO.2
5292,1CO,2,NRSV,none of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory,1,1CO.2
5293,1CO,2,NRSV,but as it is written what no eye has seen nor ear heard nor the human heart conceived what god has prepared for those who love him these things god has revealed to us through the spirit for the spirit searches everything even the depths of god,and all of them said the same,1,1CO.2
5294,1CO,2,NRSV,for what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within,when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path,1,1CO.2
5295,1CO,2,NRSV,so also no one comprehends what is truly gods except the spirit of god,was i vacillating when i wanted to do this,1,1CO.2
5296,1CO,2,NRSV,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is from god so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by god,for even when i was in thessalonica you sent me help for my needs more than once,1,1CO.2
5297,1CO,2,NRSV,and we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the spirit interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual,and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have obtained the requests made of him,1,1CO.2
5298,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of gods spirit for they are foolishness to them and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned,and he said to him lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death jesus said i tell you peter the cock will not crow this day until you have denied three times that you know me,1,1CO.2
5299,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are spiritual discern all things and they are themselves subject to no one elses scrutiny,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself,1,1CO.2
5300,1CO,2,NRSV,for who has known the mind of the lord so as to instruct him,he must manage his own household well keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how can he take care of gods church,1,1CO.2
5301,1CO,2,NRSV,but we have the mind of christ,and people from the whole judean countryside and all the people of jerusalem were going out to him and were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins,1,1CO.2
5302,1CO,3,NRSV,and so brothers and sisters i could not speak to you as spiritual people but rather as people of the flesh as infants in christ,when they had entered the city they went to the room upstairs where they were staying peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas son of james,1,1CO.3
5303,1CO,3,NRSV,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food,and they glorified god because of me,1,1CO.3
5304,1CO,3,NRSV,even now you are still not ready for you are still of the flesh,then one of the elders addressed me saying who are these robed in white and where have they come from,1,1CO.3
5305,1CO,3,NRSV,for as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not of the flesh and behaving according to human inclinations,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human,0,1CO.3
5306,1CO,3,NRSV,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human,you remember our labor and toil brothers and sisters we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of god,1,1CO.3
5307,1CO,3,NRSV,servants through whom you came to believe as the lord assigned to each,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth,0,1CO.3
5308,1CO,3,NRSV,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth,what then will the owner of the vineyard do,1,1CO.3
5309,1CO,3,NRSV,so neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything but only god who gives the growth,if god is for us who is against us,1,1CO.3
5310,1CO,3,NRSV,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building,0,1CO.3
5311,1CO,3,NRSV,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building,according to the grace of god given to me like a skilled master builder i laid a foundation and someone else is building on it,0,1CO.3
5312,1CO,3,NRSV,according to the grace of god given to me like a skilled master builder i laid a foundation and someone else is building on it,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,0,1CO.3
5313,1CO,3,NRSV,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,as indeed he says in hosea those who were not my people i will call my people and her who was not beloved i will call beloved,1,1CO.3
5314,1CO,3,NRSV,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw the work of each builder will become visible for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test what sort of work each has done,0,1CO.3
5315,1CO,3,NRSV,now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw the work of each builder will become visible for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test what sort of work each has done,for those who desire life and desire to see good days let them keep their tongues from evil and their lips from speaking deceit let them turn away from evil and do good let them seek peace and pursue it,1,1CO.3
5316,1CO,3,NRSV,if what has been built on the foundation survives the builder will receive a reward,if the work is burned up the builder will suffer loss the builder will be saved but only as through fire,0,1CO.3
5317,1CO,3,NRSV,if the work is burned up the builder will suffer loss the builder will be saved but only as through fire,do you not know that you are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells in you,0,1CO.3
5318,1CO,3,NRSV,do you not know that you are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells in you,if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person,0,1CO.3
5319,1CO,3,NRSV,if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person,for gods temple is holy and you are that temple,0,1CO.3
5320,1CO,3,NRSV,for gods temple is holy and you are that temple,if you think that you are wise in this age you should become fools so that you may become wise,0,1CO.3
5321,1CO,3,NRSV,if you think that you are wise in this age you should become fools so that you may become wise,and ought not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day,1,1CO.3
5322,1CO,3,NRSV,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god,for it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile,0,1CO.3
5323,1CO,3,NRSV,for it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile,he also measured its wall one hundred fortyfour cubits by human measurement which the angel was using,1,1CO.3
5324,1CO,3,NRSV,so let no one boast about human leaders,jesus said to them watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees,1,1CO.3
5325,1CO,3,NRSV,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the futureall belong to you and you belong to christ and christ belongs to god,think of us in this way as servants of christ and stewards of gods mysteries,0,1CO.3
5354,1CO,5,NRSV,it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that is not found even among pagans for a man is living with his fathers wife,and you are arrogant should you not rather have mourned so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you,0,1CO.5
5355,1CO,5,NRSV,and you are arrogant should you not rather have mourned so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,1,1CO.5
5356,1CO,5,NRSV,for though absent in body i am present in spirit and as if present i have already pronounced judgment in the name of the lord jesus on the man who has done such a thing,likewise urge the younger men to be selfcontrolled,1,1CO.5
5357,1CO,5,NRSV,when you are assembled and my spirit is present with the power of our lord jesus you are to hand this man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the lord,your boasting is not a good thing,0,1CO.5
5358,1CO,5,NRSV,your boasting is not a good thing,do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,0,1CO.5
5359,1CO,5,NRSV,do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,for i wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that i have for you,1,1CO.5
5360,1CO,5,NRSV,clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch as you really are unleavened,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons,1,1CO.5
5361,1CO,5,NRSV,for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,0,1CO.5
5362,1CO,5,NRSV,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, from his fullness we have all received grace upon grace,1,1CO.5
5363,1CO,5,NRSV,i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral persons not at all meaning the immoral of this world or the greedy and robbers or idolaters since you would then need to go out of the world,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber,0,1CO.5
5364,1CO,5,NRSV,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber,all wrongdoing is sin but there is sin that is not mortal,1,1CO.5
5365,1CO,5,NRSV,do not even eat with such a one,but he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know this man you are talking about,1,1CO.5
5366,1CO,5,NRSV,for what have i to do with judging those outside,and immediately they left their nets and followed him,1,1CO.5
5367,1CO,5,NRSV,is it not those who are inside that you are to judge,but of the son he says your throne o god is forever and ever and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom,1,1CO.5
5368,1CO,5,NRSV,drive out the wicked person from among you,when any of you has a grievance against another do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it before the saints,0,1CO.5
5395,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning the matters about which you wrote it is well for a man not to touch a woman,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband,0,1CO.7
5396,1CO,7,NRSV,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband,when the believers learned of it they brought him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus,1,1CO.7
5397,1CO,7,NRSV,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband,but for that very reason i received mercy so that in me as the foremost jesus christ might display the utmost patience making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life,1,1CO.7
5398,1CO,7,NRSV,for the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does,on the first day of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is sacrificed his disciples said to him where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the passover,1,1CO.7
5399,1CO,7,NRSV,do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer and then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol,this i say by way of concession not of command,0,1CO.7
5400,1CO,7,NRSV,this i say by way of concession not of command,as for those who in the present age are rich command them not to be haughty or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but rather on god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment,1,1CO.7
5401,1CO,7,NRSV,i wish that all were as i myself am,but each has a particular gift from god one having one kind and another a different kind,0,1CO.7
5402,1CO,7,NRSV,but each has a particular gift from god one having one kind and another a different kind,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am,0,1CO.7
5403,1CO,7,NRSV,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am,but if they are not practicing selfcontrol they should marry,0,1CO.7
5404,1CO,7,NRSV,but if they are not practicing selfcontrol they should marry,and now i am no longer in the world but they are in the world and i am coming to you,1,1CO.7
5405,1CO,7,NRSV,for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion,we know that christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him,1,1CO.7
5406,1CO,7,NRSV,to the married i give this commandnot i but the lordthat the wife should not separate from her husband but if she does separate let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and that the husband should not divorce his wife,truly i tell you not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down,1,1CO.7
5407,1CO,7,NRSV,to the rest i sayi and not the lordthat if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself so that where i am there you may be also,1,1CO.7
5408,1CO,7,NRSV,and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her she should not divorce him,divided tongues as of fire appeared among them and a tongue rested on each of them,1,1CO.7
5409,1CO,7,NRSV,for the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband,little children let no one deceive you,1,1CO.7
5410,1CO,7,NRSV,otherwise your children would be unclean but as it is they are holy,he must increase but i must decrease,1,1CO.7
5411,1CO,7,NRSV,but if the unbelieving partner separates let it be so in such a case the brother or sister is not bound,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,1,1CO.7
5412,1CO,7,NRSV,it is to peace that god has called you,the saying is sure if we have died with him we will also live with him if we endure we will also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself,1,1CO.7
5413,1CO,7,NRSV,wife for all you know you might save your husband,husband for all you know you might save your wife,0,1CO.7
5414,1CO,7,NRSV,husband for all you know you might save your wife,however that may be let each of you lead the life that the lord has assigned to which god called you,0,1CO.7
5415,1CO,7,NRSV,however that may be let each of you lead the life that the lord has assigned to which god called you,this is my rule in all the churches,0,1CO.7
5416,1CO,7,NRSV,this is my rule in all the churches,they do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,1,1CO.7
5417,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision,0,1CO.7
5418,1CO,7,NRSV,let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision,was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised,0,1CO.7
5419,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk,1,1CO.7
5420,1CO,7,NRSV,circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but obeying the commandments of god is everything,god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them,1,1CO.7
5421,1CO,7,NRSV,let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called,were you a slave when called,0,1CO.7
5422,1CO,7,NRSV,were you a slave when called,do not be concerned about it,0,1CO.7
5423,1CO,7,NRSV,do not be concerned about it,even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever,0,1CO.7
5424,1CO,7,NRSV,even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ,0,1CO.7
5425,1CO,7,NRSV,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ,so when he came he went up to him at once and said rabbi and kissed him,1,1CO.7
5426,1CO,7,NRSV,you were bought with a price do not become slaves of human masters,in whatever condition you were called brothers and sisters there remain with god,0,1CO.7
5427,1CO,7,NRSV,in whatever condition you were called brothers and sisters there remain with god,now concerning virgins i have no command of the lord but i give my opinion as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy,0,1CO.7
5428,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning virgins i have no command of the lord but i give my opinion as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are,0,1CO.7
5429,1CO,7,NRSV,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are,and the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning they will stand far off in fear of her torment and say alas alas the great city babylon the mighty city for in one hour your judgment has come,1,1CO.7
5430,1CO,7,NRSV,are you bound to a wife,he said all this quite openly,1,1CO.7
5431,1CO,7,NRSV,do not seek to be free,are you free from a wife,0,1CO.7
5432,1CO,7,NRSV,are you free from a wife,but if you marry you do not sin and if a virgin marries she does not sin,0,1CO.7
5433,1CO,7,NRSV,but if you marry you do not sin and if a virgin marries she does not sin,he had been instructed in the way of the lord and he spoke with burning enthusiasm and taught accurately the things concerning jesus though he knew only the baptism of john,1,1CO.7
5434,1CO,7,NRSV,yet those who marry will experience distress in this life and i would spare you that,greet prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus,1,1CO.7
5435,1CO,7,NRSV,i mean brothers and sisters the appointed time has grown short from now on let even those who have wives be as though they had none and those who mourn as though they were not mourning and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they had no possessions and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,1,1CO.7
5436,1CO,7,NRSV,for the present form of this world is passing away,immediately they left their nets and followed him,1,1CO.7

5968,GAL,1,NRSV,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ,but even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you let that one be accursed as we have said before so now i repeat if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received let that one be accursed am i now seeking human approval or gods approval,0,GAL.1
5969,GAL,1,NRSV,but even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you let that one be accursed as we have said before so now i repeat if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received let that one be accursed am i now seeking human approval or gods approval,from the same mouth come blessing and cursing,1,GAL.1
5970,GAL,1,NRSV,or am i trying to please people,if i were still pleasing people i would not be a servant of christ,0,GAL.1
5971,GAL,1,NRSV,if i were still pleasing people i would not be a servant of christ,for i want you to know brothers and sisters that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin for i did not receive it from a human source nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ,0,GAL.1
5972,GAL,1,NRSV,for i want you to know brothers and sisters that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin for i did not receive it from a human source nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,1,GAL.1
5973,GAL,1,NRSV,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace,1,GAL.1
5974,GAL,1,NRSV,i was violently persecuting the church of god and was trying to destroy it,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord,1,GAL.1
5975,GAL,1,NRSV,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,1,GAL.1
5976,GAL,1,NRSV,but when god who had set me apart before i was born and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me so that i might proclaim him among the gentiles i did not confer with any human being nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me but i went away at once into arabia and afterwards i returned to damascus,then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit cephas and stayed with him fifteen days but i did not see any other apostle except james the lords brother,0,GAL.1
5977,GAL,1,NRSV,then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit cephas and stayed with him fifteen days but i did not see any other apostle except james the lords brother,in what i am writing to you before god i do not lie then i went into the regions of syria and cilicia and i was still unknown by sight to the churches of judea that are in christ they only heard it said the one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy,0,GAL.1
5978,GAL,1,NRSV,in what i am writing to you before god i do not lie then i went into the regions of syria and cilicia and i was still unknown by sight to the churches of judea that are in christ they only heard it said the one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy,then jesus said to the chief priests the officers of the temple police and the elders who had come for him have you come out with swords and clubs as if i were a bandit,1,GAL.1
5979,GAL,1,NRSV,and they glorified god because of me,then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus along with me,0,GAL.1
5980,GAL,2,NRSV,then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus along with me,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home,1,GAL.2
5981,GAL,2,NRSV,i went up in response to a revelation,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well,1,GAL.2
5982,GAL,2,NRSV,then i laid before them though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders the gospel that i proclaim among the gentiles in order to make sure that i was not running or had not run in vain,share in suffering like a good soldier of christ jesus,1,GAL.2
5983,GAL,2,NRSV,but even titus who was with me was not compelled to be circumcised though he was a greek,then he said to me it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end,1,GAL.2
5984,GAL,2,NRSV,but because of false believers secretly brought in who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus so that they might enslave us we did not submit to them even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you,are you able to drink the cup that i am about to drink,1,GAL.2
5985,GAL,2,NRSV,and from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders what they actually were makes no difference to me god shows no partialitythose leaders contributed nothing to me,worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy,1,GAL.2
5986,GAL,2,NRSV,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him,1,GAL.2
5987,GAL,2,NRSV,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was eager to do,do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the son of man will give you,1,GAL.2
5988,GAL,2,NRSV,but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood selfcondemned for until certain people came from james he used to eat with the gentiles,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,1,GAL.2
5989,GAL,2,NRSV,but after they came he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy,0,GAL.2
5990,GAL,2,NRSV,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,0,GAL.2
5991,GAL,2,NRSV,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ,0,GAL.2
5992,GAL,2,NRSV,we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,1,GAL.2
5993,GAL,2,NRSV,and we have come to believe in christ jesus so that we might be justified by faith in christ and not by doing the works of the law because no one will be justified by the works of the law,even with these words they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them,1,GAL.2
5994,GAL,2,NRSV,but if in our effort to be justified in christ we ourselves have been found to be sinners is christ then a servant of sin,you are witnesses of these things,1,GAL.2
5995,GAL,2,NRSV,certainly not but if i build up again the very things that i once tore down then i demonstrate that i am a transgressor,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god,0,GAL.2
5996,GAL,2,NRSV,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god,and when the demon had been cast out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed and said never has anything like this been seen in israel,1,GAL.2
5997,GAL,2,NRSV,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me,therefore friends select from among yourselves seven men of good standing full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint to this task while we for our part will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word,1,GAL.2
5998,GAL,2,NRSV,and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me,i do not nullify the grace of god for if justification comes through the law then christ died for nothing,0,GAL.2
5999,GAL,2,NRSV,i do not nullify the grace of god for if justification comes through the law then christ died for nothing,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you,0,GAL.2
6000,GAL,3,NRSV,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you,it was before your eyes that jesus christ was publicly exhibited as crucified the only thing i want to learn from you is this did you receive the spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard,0,GAL.3
6001,GAL,3,NRSV,it was before your eyes that jesus christ was publicly exhibited as crucified the only thing i want to learn from you is this did you receive the spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard,having started with the spirit are you now ending with the flesh,0,GAL.3
6002,GAL,3,NRSV,having started with the spirit are you now ending with the flesh,did you experience so much for nothingif it really was for nothing,0,GAL.3
6003,GAL,3,NRSV,did you experience so much for nothingif it really was for nothing,well then does god supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard,0,GAL.3
6004,GAL,3,NRSV,well then does god supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard,from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute,1,GAL.3
6005,GAL,3,NRSV,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham,for you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us we were not idle when we were with you and we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you,1,GAL.3
6006,GAL,3,NRSV,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith declared the gospel beforehand to abraham saying all the gentiles shall be blessed in you,for this reason those who believe are blessed with abraham who believed,0,GAL.3
6007,GAL,3,NRSV,for this reason those who believe are blessed with abraham who believed,we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed and we might no longer be enslaved to sin,1,GAL.3
6008,GAL,3,NRSV,for all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law,they said to him sir give us this bread always,1,GAL.3
6009,GAL,3,NRSV,now it is evident that no one is justified before god by the law for the one who is righteous will live by faith,but the law does not rest on faith on the contrary whoever does the works of the law will live by them,0,GAL.3
6010,GAL,3,NRSV,but the law does not rest on faith on the contrary whoever does the works of the law will live by them,therefore when we could bear it no longer we decided to be left alone in athens and we sent timothy our brother and coworker for god in proclaiming the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions,1,GAL.3
6011,GAL,3,NRSV,christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for usfor it is written cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree in order that in christ jesus the blessing of abraham might come to the gentiles so that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith,only believe and she will be saved,1,GAL.3
6012,GAL,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters i give an example from daily life once a persons will has been ratified no one adds to it or annuls it,with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah that says you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive,1,GAL.3
6013,GAL,3,NRSV,now the promises were made to abraham and to his offspring it does not say and to offsprings as of many but it says and to your offspring that is to one person who is christ,great crowds came to him bringing with them the lame the maimed the blind the mute and many others,1,GAL.3
6014,GAL,3,NRSV,my point is this the law which came four hundred thirty years later does not annul a covenant previously ratified by god so as to nullify the promise,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise,0,GAL.3
6015,GAL,3,NRSV,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise,do i make my plans according to ordinary human standards ready to say yes yes and no no at the same time,1,GAL.3
6016,GAL,3,NRSV,it was added because of transgressions until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made and it was ordained through angels by a mediator,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus,1,GAL.3
6017,GAL,3,NRSV,now a mediator involves more than one party but god is one,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived,1,GAL.3
6018,GAL,3,NRSV,is the law then opposed to the promises of god,certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law,0,GAL.3
6019,GAL,3,NRSV,certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,0,GAL.3
6020,GAL,3,NRSV,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,now before faith came we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed,0,GAL.3
6021,GAL,3,NRSV,now before faith came we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed,therefore the law was our disciplinarian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith,0,GAL.3
6022,GAL,3,NRSV,therefore the law was our disciplinarian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith,but now that faith has come we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian for in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith,0,GAL.3
6023,GAL,3,NRSV,but now that faith has come we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian for in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith,as many of you as were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ,0,GAL.3
6024,GAL,3,NRSV,as many of you as were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ,there is no longer jew or greek there is no longer slave or free there is no longer male and female for all of you are one in christ jesus,0,GAL.3
6025,GAL,3,NRSV,there is no longer jew or greek there is no longer slave or free there is no longer male and female for all of you are one in christ jesus,since lydda was near joppa the disciples who heard that peter was there sent two men to him with the request please come to us without delay,1,GAL.3
6026,GAL,3,NRSV,and if you belong to christ then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to the promise,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god,1,GAL.3
6027,GAL,4,NRSV,my point is this heirs as long as they are minors are no better than slaves though they are the owners of all the property but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father,for i want you to know how much i am struggling for you and for those in laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,1,GAL.4
6028,GAL,4,NRSV,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world,indeed we felt that we had received the sentence of death so that we would rely not on ourselves but on god who raises the dead,1,GAL.4
6029,GAL,4,NRSV,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children,and because you are children god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father so you are no longer a slave but a child and if a child then also an heir through god,0,GAL.4
6030,GAL,4,NRSV,and because you are children god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father so you are no longer a slave but a child and if a child then also an heir through god,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret,1,GAL.4
6031,GAL,4,NRSV,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,now however that you have come to know god or rather to be known by god how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits,0,GAL.4
6032,GAL,4,NRSV,now however that you have come to know god or rather to be known by god how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits,it was also about these that enoch in the seventh generation from adam prophesied saying see the lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him,1,GAL.4
6033,GAL,4,NRSV,how can you want to be enslaved to them again,but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about,1,GAL.4
6034,GAL,4,NRSV,you are observing special days and months and seasons and years,if i give away all my possessions and if i hand over my body so that i may boast but do not have love i gain nothing,1,GAL.4
6035,GAL,4,NRSV,i am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted,therefore to keep me from being too elated a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to torment me to keep me from being too elated,1,GAL.4
6036,GAL,4,NRSV,friends i beg you become as i am for i also have become as you are,you have done me no wrong,0,GAL.4
6037,GAL,4,NRSV,you have done me no wrong,so i would have younger widows marry bear children and manage their households so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us,1,GAL.4
6038,GAL,4,NRSV,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat,1,GAL.4
6039,GAL,4,NRSV,what has become of the goodwill you felt,so they are no longer two but one flesh,1,GAL.4
6040,GAL,4,NRSV,for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me,have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth,0,GAL.4
6041,GAL,4,NRSV,have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,0,GAL.4
6042,GAL,4,NRSV,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices,1,GAL.4
6043,GAL,4,NRSV,it is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times and not only when i am present with you,my little children for whom i am again in the pain of childbirth until christ is formed in you i wish i were present with you now and could change my tone for i am perplexed about you,0,GAL.4
6044,GAL,4,NRSV,my little children for whom i am again in the pain of childbirth until christ is formed in you i wish i were present with you now and could change my tone for i am perplexed about you,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me,1,GAL.4
6045,GAL,4,NRSV,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law,they said to her you are out of your mind but she insisted that it was so,1,GAL.4
6046,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman,they took the body of jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths according to the burial custom of the jews,1,GAL.4
6047,GAL,4,NRSV,one the child of the slave was born according to the flesh the other the child of the free woman was born through the promise,now this is an allegory these women are two covenants,0,GAL.4
6048,GAL,4,NRSV,now this is an allegory these women are two covenants,why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me,1,GAL.4
6049,GAL,4,NRSV,one woman in fact is hagar from mount sinai bearing children for slavery,now hagar is mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children,0,GAL.4
6050,GAL,4,NRSV,now hagar is mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children,but the other woman corresponds to the jerusalem above she is free and she is our mother,0,GAL.4
6051,GAL,4,NRSV,but the other woman corresponds to the jerusalem above she is free and she is our mother,and the word became flesh and lived among us and we have seen his glory the glory as of a fathers only son full of grace and truth,1,GAL.4
6052,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,now you my friends are children of the promise like isaac,0,GAL.4
6053,GAL,4,NRSV,now you my friends are children of the promise like isaac,i do not give to you as the world gives,1,GAL.4
6054,GAL,4,NRSV,but just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the spirit so it is now also,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail,1,GAL.4
6055,GAL,4,NRSV,but what does the scripture say,when they had gone ashore they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and bread,1,GAL.4
6056,GAL,4,NRSV,drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,1,GAL.4
6057,GAL,4,NRSV,so then friends we are children not of the slave but of the free woman,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices,1,GAL.4
6058,GAL,5,NRSV,for freedom christ has set us free,stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery,0,GAL.5
6059,GAL,5,NRSV,stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery,listen i paul am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you,0,GAL.5
6060,GAL,5,NRSV,listen i paul am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law,0,GAL.5
6061,GAL,5,NRSV,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace,0,GAL.5
6062,GAL,5,NRSV,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace,and have mercy on some who are wavering save others by snatching them out of the fire and have mercy on still others with fear hating even the tunic defiled by their bodies,1,GAL.5
6063,GAL,5,NRSV,for through the spirit by faith we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness,now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary,1,GAL.5
6064,GAL,5,NRSV,for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything the only thing that counts is faith working through love,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,0,GAL.5
6065,GAL,5,NRSV,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you,0,GAL.5
6066,GAL,5,NRSV,such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you,a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,0,GAL.5
6067,GAL,5,NRSV,a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough,i am confident about you in the lord that you will not think otherwise,0,GAL.5
6068,GAL,5,NRSV,i am confident about you in the lord that you will not think otherwise,guard the good treasure entrusted to you with the help of the holy spirit living in us,1,GAL.5

6701,HEB,3,NRSV,christ however was faithful over gods house as a son and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope,therefore as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion as on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors put me to the test though they had seen my works for forty years,0,HEB.3
6702,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion as on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors put me to the test though they had seen my works for forty years,therefore i was angry with that generation and i said they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways,0,HEB.3
6703,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore i was angry with that generation and i said they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways,as in my anger i swore they will not enter my rest,0,HEB.3
6704,HEB,3,NRSV,as in my anger i swore they will not enter my rest,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,0,HEB.3
6705,HEB,3,NRSV,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,0,HEB.3
6706,HEB,3,NRSV,but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,for we have become partners of christ if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end,0,HEB.3
6707,HEB,3,NRSV,for we have become partners of christ if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end,immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd,1,HEB.3
6708,HEB,3,NRSV,as it is said today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious,0,HEB.3
6709,HEB,3,NRSV,now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious,then they said to him where is your father,1,HEB.3
6710,HEB,3,NRSV,was it not all those who left egypt under the leadership of moses,but with whom was he angry forty years,0,HEB.3
6711,HEB,3,NRSV,but with whom was he angry forty years,the one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them and made five more talents,1,HEB.3
6712,HEB,3,NRSV,was it not those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness,and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if not to those who were disobedient,0,HEB.3
6713,HEB,3,NRSV,and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if not to those who were disobedient,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him,1,HEB.3
6714,HEB,3,NRSV,so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief,therefore while the promise of entering his rest is still open let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it,0,HEB.3
6715,HEB,4,NRSV,therefore while the promise of entering his rest is still open let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it,then i saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth,1,HEB.4
6716,HEB,4,NRSV,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened,for we who have believed enter that rest just as god has said as in my anger i swore they shall not enter my rest though his works were finished at the foundation of the world,0,HEB.4
6717,HEB,4,NRSV,for we who have believed enter that rest just as god has said as in my anger i swore they shall not enter my rest though his works were finished at the foundation of the world,on peters arrival cornelius met him and falling at his feet worshiped him,1,HEB.4
6718,HEB,4,NRSV,for in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows and god rested on the seventh day from all his works,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest,0,HEB.4
6719,HEB,4,NRSV,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest,then how will you understand all the parables,1,HEB.4
6720,HEB,4,NRSV,since therefore it remains open for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience again he sets a certain daytodaysaying through david much later in the words already quoted today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts,for if joshua had given them rest god would not speak later about another day,0,HEB.4
6721,HEB,4,NRSV,for if joshua had given them rest god would not speak later about another day,so then a sabbath rest still remains for the people of god for those who enter gods rest also cease from their labors as god did from his,0,HEB.4
6722,HEB,4,NRSV,so then a sabbath rest still remains for the people of god for those who enter gods rest also cease from their labors as god did from his,after this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country,1,HEB.4
6723,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,0,HEB.4
6724,HEB,4,NRSV,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior,1,HEB.4
6725,HEB,4,NRSV,and before him no creature is hidden but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account,since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our confession,0,HEB.4
6726,HEB,4,NRSV,since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our confession,early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb,1,HEB.4
6727,HEB,4,NRSV,for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are yet without sin,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,0,HEB.4
6728,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to god on their behalf to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins,0,HEB.4
6729,HEB,5,NRSV,every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to god on their behalf to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins,he is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is subject to weakness and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people,0,HEB.5
6730,HEB,5,NRSV,he is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is subject to weakness and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people,the point is this the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully,1,HEB.5
6731,HEB,5,NRSV,and one does not presume to take this honor but takes it only when called by god just as aaron was,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification,1,HEB.5
6732,HEB,5,NRSV,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he says also in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god,1,HEB.5
6733,HEB,5,NRSV,in the days of his flesh jesus offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission,he said i do not know,1,HEB.5
6734,HEB,5,NRSV,although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered and having been made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him having been designated by god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek,about this we have much to say that is hard to explain since you have become dull in understanding,0,HEB.5
6735,HEB,5,NRSV,about this we have much to say that is hard to explain since you have become dull in understanding,at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,1,HEB.5
6736,HEB,5,NRSV,for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of god,and leaving the crowd behind they took him with them in the boat just as he was,1,HEB.5
6737,HEB,5,NRSV,you need milk not solid food for everyone who lives on milk being still an infant is unskilled in the word of righteousness,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron,1,HEB.5
6738,HEB,5,NRSV,but solid food is for the mature for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil,they kept heaping many other insults on him,1,HEB.5
6739,HEB,6,NRSV,therefore let us go on toward perfection leaving behind the basic teaching about christ and not laying again the foundation repentance from dead works and faith toward god instruction about baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment,and we will do this if god permits,0,HEB.6
6740,HEB,6,NRSV,and we will do this if god permits,should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave as i had mercy on you,1,HEB.6
6741,HEB,6,NRSV,for it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the holy spirit and have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the age to come and then have fallen away since on their own they are crucifying again the son of god and are holding him up to contempt,ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from god,0,HEB.6
6742,HEB,6,NRSV,ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from god,but if it produces thorns and thistles it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed its end is to be burned over,0,HEB.6
6743,HEB,6,NRSV,but if it produces thorns and thistles it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed its end is to be burned over,and now lord look at their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant jesus,1,HEB.6
6744,HEB,6,NRSV,even though we speak in this way beloved we are confident of better things in your case things that belong to salvation,for god is not unjust he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints as you still do,0,HEB.6
6745,HEB,6,NRSV,for god is not unjust he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints as you still do,and we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end so that you may not become sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises,0,HEB.6
6746,HEB,6,NRSV,and we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end so that you may not become sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises,and have mercy on some who are wavering save others by snatching them out of the fire and have mercy on still others with fear hating even the tunic defiled by their bodies,1,HEB.6
6747,HEB,6,NRSV,when god made a promise to abraham because he had no one greater by whom to swear he swore by himself saying i will surely bless you and multiply you,others to test him kept demanding from him a sign from heaven,1,HEB.6
6748,HEB,6,NRSV,and thus abraham having patiently endured obtained the promise,for david says concerning him i saw the lord always before me for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced moreover my flesh will live in hope,1,HEB.6
6749,HEB,6,NRSV,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us,0,HEB.6
6750,HEB,6,NRSV,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,0,HEB.6
6751,HEB,6,NRSV,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened,1,HEB.6
6752,HEB,7,NRSV,this king melchizedek of salem priest of the most high god met abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him and to him abraham apportioned onetenth of everything,his name in the first place means king of righteousness next he is also king of salem that is king of peace,0,HEB.7
6753,HEB,7,NRSV,his name in the first place means king of righteousness next he is also king of salem that is king of peace,he answered the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash,1,HEB.7
6754,HEB,7,NRSV,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils,0,HEB.7
6755,HEB,7,NRSV,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils,i have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling,1,HEB.7
6756,HEB,7,NRSV,and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people that is from their kindred though these also are descended from abraham,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises,0,HEB.7
6757,HEB,7,NRSV,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises,this was to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet out of egypt i have called my son,1,HEB.7
6758,HEB,7,NRSV,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,0,HEB.7
6759,HEB,7,NRSV,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,now the jewish festival of booths was near,1,HEB.7
6760,HEB,7,NRSV,one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron,0,HEB.7
6761,HEB,7,NRSV,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron,for when there is a change in the priesthood there is necessarily a change in the law as well,0,HEB.7
6762,HEB,7,NRSV,for when there is a change in the priesthood there is necessarily a change in the law as well,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,0,HEB.7
6763,HEB,7,NRSV,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,when we heard this we and the people there urged him not to go up to jerusalem,1,HEB.7
6764,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is evident that our lord was descended from judah and in connection with that tribe moses said nothing about priests,for jews demand signs and greeks desire wisdom but we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles but to those who are the called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god,1,HEB.7
6765,HEB,7,NRSV,it is even more obvious when another priest arises resembling melchizedek one who has become a priest not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life,then the high priest tore his clothes and said why do we still need witnesses,1,HEB.7
6766,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is attested of him you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,pray that i may declare it boldly as i must speak,1,HEB.7
6767,HEB,7,NRSV,there is on the one hand the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual for the law made nothing perfect there is on the other hand the introduction of a better hope through which we approach god,when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the elders and jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him,1,HEB.7
6768,HEB,7,NRSV,this was confirmed with an oath for others who became priests took their office without an oath but this one became a priest with an oath because of the one who said to him the lord has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever accordingly jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant,furthermore the former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office but he holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever,0,HEB.7
6769,HEB,7,NRSV,furthermore the former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office but he holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever,consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them,0,HEB.7
6770,HEB,7,NRSV,consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them,for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy blameless undefiled separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens,0,HEB.7
6771,HEB,7,NRSV,for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy blameless undefiled separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens,unlike the other high priests he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for those of the people this he did once for all when he offered himself,0,HEB.7
6772,HEB,7,NRSV,unlike the other high priests he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for those of the people this he did once for all when he offered himself,for the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness but the word of the oath which came later than the law appoints a son who has been made perfect forever,0,HEB.7
6773,HEB,7,NRSV,for the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness but the word of the oath which came later than the law appoints a son who has been made perfect forever,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up,0,HEB.7
6774,HEB,8,NRSV,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up,for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me,1,HEB.8
6775,HEB,8,NRSV,for every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer,you are held in honor but we in disrepute,1,HEB.8
6776,HEB,8,NRSV,now if he were on earth he would not be a priest at all since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law,they asked him teacher when will this be and what will be the sign that this is about to take place,1,HEB.8
6777,HEB,8,NRSV,they offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain,but jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted through better promises,0,HEB.8
6778,HEB,8,NRSV,but jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted through better promises,therefore i was angry with that generation and i said they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways,1,HEB.8
6779,HEB,8,NRSV,for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no need to look for a second one,he will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others,1,HEB.8
6780,HEB,8,NRSV,god finds fault with them when he says the days are surely coming says the lord when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not like the covenant that i made with their ancestors on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt for they did not continue in my covenant and so i had no concern for them says the lord,this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people,0,HEB.8
6781,HEB,8,NRSV,this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people,and they shall not teach one another or say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest,0,HEB.8
6782,HEB,8,NRSV,and they shall not teach one another or say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest,for i will be merciful toward their iniquities and i will remember their sins no more,0,HEB.8
6783,HEB,8,NRSV,for i will be merciful toward their iniquities and i will remember their sins no more,pilate gave him permission so he came and removed his body,1,HEB.8
6784,HEB,8,NRSV,in speaking of a new covenant he has made the first one obsolete,and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear,0,HEB.8
6785,HEB,8,NRSV,and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear,be dressed for action and have your lamps lit be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks,1,HEB.8
6786,HEB,9,NRSV,now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary,for a tent was constructed the first one in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence this is called the holy place,0,HEB.9
6787,HEB,9,NRSV,for a tent was constructed the first one in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence this is called the holy place,behind the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,0,HEB.9
6788,HEB,9,NRSV,behind the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,then jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and he looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly,1,HEB.9
6789,HEB,9,NRSV,in it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold in which there were a golden urn holding the manna and aarons rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat,so also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great exploits,1,HEB.9
6790,HEB,9,NRSV,of these things we cannot speak now in detail,such preparations having been made the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties but only the high priest goes into the second and he but once a year and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people,0,HEB.9
6791,HEB,9,NRSV,such preparations having been made the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties but only the high priest goes into the second and he but once a year and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing,0,HEB.9
6792,HEB,9,NRSV,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing,let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift,1,HEB.9
6793,HEB,9,NRSV,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right,meanwhile when the crowd gathered by the thousands so that they trampled on one another he began to speak first to his disciples beware of the yeast of the pharisees that is their hypocrisy,1,HEB.9
6794,HEB,9,NRSV,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption,for if the blood of goats and bulls with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified how much more will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to god purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living god for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant,0,HEB.9
6795,HEB,9,NRSV,for if the blood of goats and bulls with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified how much more will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to god purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living god for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,1,HEB.9
6796,HEB,9,NRSV,where a will is involved the death of the one who made it must be established,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him,1,HEB.9
6797,HEB,9,NRSV,for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive,hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood,0,HEB.9
6798,HEB,9,NRSV,hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood,now judas who betrayed him also knew the place because jesus often met there with his disciples,1,HEB.9
6799,HEB,9,NRSV,for when every commandment had been told to all the people by moses in accordance with the law he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people saying this is the blood of the covenant that god has ordained for you,what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me,1,HEB.9
6800,HEB,9,NRSV,and in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship,jesus answered them truly i tell you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will be done,1,HEB.9

6806,HEB,9,NRSV,and just as it is appointed for mortals to die once and after that the judgment so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him,since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities it can never by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year make perfect those who approach,0,HEB.9
6807,HEB,10,NRSV,since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities it can never by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year make perfect those who approach,otherwise would they not have ceased being offered since the worshipers cleansed once for all would no longer have any consciousness of sin,0,HEB.10
