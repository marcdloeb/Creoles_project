3126,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,0,JHN.7
3127,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,so he began to look for an opportunity to betray him,1,JHN.7
3128,JHN,7,NRSV,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him,0,JHN.7

3139,JHN,7,NRSV,and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from,0,JHN.7
3140,JHN,7,NRSV,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from,0,JHN.7
3141,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from,the jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true,1,JHN.7
3142,JHN,7,NRSV,i have not come on my own,but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him,0,JHN.7
3143,JHN,7,NRSV,but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him,i know him because i am from him and he sent me,0,JHN.7

3153,JHN,7,NRSV,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,just this that christ is proclaimed in every way whether out of false motives or true and in that i rejoice,1,JHN.7
3154,JHN,7,NRSV,as the scripture has said out of the believers heart shall flow rivers of living water,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus was not yet glorified,0,JHN.7
3155,JHN,7,NRSV,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus was not yet glorified,immediately he stood up before them took what he had been lying on and went to his home glorifying god,1,JHN.7
3156,JHN,7,NRSV,when they heard these words some in the crowd said this is really the prophet,others said this is the messiah,0,JHN.7
3157,JHN,7,NRSV,others said this is the messiah,then they tried to arrest him again but he escaped from their hands,1,JHN.7
3158,JHN,7,NRSV,but some asked surely the messiah does not come from galilee does he,has not the scripture said that the messiah is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived,0,JHN.7
3159,JHN,7,NRSV,has not the scripture said that the messiah is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived,he answered the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me,1,JHN.7
3160,JHN,7,NRSV,so there was a division in the crowd because of him,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,0,JHN.7
3161,JHN,7,NRSV,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,do not seek your own advantage but that of the other,1,JHN.7
3162,JHN,7,NRSV,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him,then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me,1,JHN.7
3163,JHN,7,NRSV,the police answered never has anyone spoken like this then the pharisees replied surely you have not been deceived too have you,therefore let the entire house of israel know with certainty that god has made him both lord and messiah this jesus whom you crucified,1,JHN.7
3164,JHN,7,NRSV,has any one of the authorities or of the pharisees believed in him,they will say to you look there or look here do not go do not set off in pursuit,1,JHN.7
3165,JHN,7,NRSV,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it,0,JHN.7
3166,JHN,7,NRSV,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,0,JHN.7
3167,JHN,7,NRSV,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,suddenly there appeared to them moses and elijah talking with him,1,JHN.7
3168,JHN,7,NRSV,search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from galilee,see i am coming soon blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book,1,JHN.7
3169,JHN,7,NRSV, then each of them went home,while jesus went to the mount of olives,0,JHN.7
3170,JHN,8,NRSV,while jesus went to the mount of olives,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,1,JHN.8
3171,JHN,8,NRSV,early in the morning he came again to the temple,after agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard,1,JHN.8
3172,JHN,8,NRSV,all the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them,for you always have the poor with you and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish but you will not always have me,1,JHN.8
3173,JHN,8,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and making her stand before all of them they said to him teacher this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery,now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women,0,JHN.8
3174,JHN,8,NRSV,now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women,just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age,1,JHN.8
3175,JHN,8,NRSV,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him,the law indeed was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ,1,JHN.8
3176,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground,the tribune took him by the hand drew him aside privately and asked what is it that you have to report to me,1,JHN.8
3177,JHN,8,NRSV,when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our lord jesus christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness is conceited understanding nothing and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words,1,JHN.8
3178,JHN,8,NRSV,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground,in lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet and had never walked for he had been crippled from birth,1,JHN.8
3179,JHN,8,NRSV,when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the elders and jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him,but he had to go through samaria,1,JHN.8
3180,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus straightened up and said to her woman where are they,and jesus said neither do i condemn you,0,JHN.8
3181,JHN,8,NRSV,and jesus said neither do i condemn you,when they heard that jesus was passing by they shouted lord have mercy on us son of david the crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet but they shouted even more loudly have mercy on us lord son of david jesus stood still and called them saying what do you want me to do for you,1,JHN.8
3182,JHN,8,NRSV,go your way and from now on do not sin again again jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of the world,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john came and if you are willing to accept it he is elijah who is to come,1,JHN.8
3183,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1,JHN.8
3184,JHN,8,NRSV,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid,now the time came for elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son,1,JHN.8
3185,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid because i know where i have come from and where i am going but you do not know where i come from or where i am going,the god who made the world and everything in it he who is lord of heaven and earth does not live in shrines made by human hands nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things,1,JHN.8
3186,JHN,8,NRSV,you judge by human standards i judge no one,so the chief priests planned to put lazarus to death as well since it was on account of him that many of the jews were deserting and were believing in jesus,1,JHN.8
3187,JHN,8,NRSV,yet even if i do judge my judgment is valid for it is not i alone who judge but i and the father who sent me,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid,0,JHN.8
3188,JHN,8,NRSV,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right,1,JHN.8
3189,JHN,8,NRSV,i testify on my own behalf and the father who sent me testifies on my behalf,outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood,1,JHN.8
3190,JHN,8,NRSV,then they said to him where is your father,jesus answered you know neither me nor my father,0,JHN.8
3191,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered you know neither me nor my father,if you knew me you would know my father also,0,JHN.8
3192,JHN,8,NRSV,if you knew me you would know my father also,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,0,JHN.8
3193,JHN,8,NRSV,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,again he said to them i am going away and you will search for me but you will die in your sin,0,JHN.8
3194,JHN,8,NRSV,again he said to them i am going away and you will search for me but you will die in your sin,so the crowd came and began to ask pilate to do for them according to his custom,1,JHN.8
3195,JHN,8,NRSV,where i am going you cannot come,who is it who gave you this authority,1,JHN.8
3196,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said is he going to kill himself,is that what he means by saying where i am going you cannot come,0,JHN.8
3197,JHN,8,NRSV,is that what he means by saying where i am going you cannot come,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world,0,JHN.8
3198,JHN,8,NRSV,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world,and do not bring us to the time of trial,1,JHN.8
3199,JHN,8,NRSV,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,1,JHN.8
3200,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him who are you,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,0,JHN.8
3201,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,i have much to say about you and much to condemn but the one who sent me is true and i declare to the world what i have heard from him,0,JHN.8
3202,JHN,8,NRSV,i have much to say about you and much to condemn but the one who sent me is true and i declare to the world what i have heard from him,they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father,0,JHN.8
3203,JHN,8,NRSV,they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me,0,JHN.8
3204,JHN,8,NRSV,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me,blessed are the merciful for they will receive mercy,1,JHN.8
3205,JHN,8,NRSV,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him,as he was saying these things many believed in him,0,JHN.8
3206,JHN,8,NRSV,as he was saying these things many believed in him,then jesus said to the jews who had believed in him if you continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free,0,JHN.8
3207,JHN,8,NRSV,then jesus said to the jews who had believed in him if you continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free,they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves to anyone,0,JHN.8
3208,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves to anyone,but some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath,1,JHN.8
3209,JHN,8,NRSV,what do you mean by saying you will be made free,jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem,1,JHN.8
3210,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever,0,JHN.8
3211,JHN,8,NRSV,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed,0,JHN.8
3212,JHN,8,NRSV,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed,i know that you are descendants of abraham yet you look for an opportunity to kill me because there is no place in you for my word,0,JHN.8
3213,JHN,8,NRSV,i know that you are descendants of abraham yet you look for an opportunity to kill me because there is no place in you for my word,until i arrive give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhorting to teaching,1,JHN.8
3214,JHN,8,NRSV,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father,they answered him abraham is our father,0,JHN.8
3215,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him abraham is our father,jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing what abraham did but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god,0,JHN.8
3216,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing what abraham did but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god,but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive opinions,1,JHN.8
3217,JHN,8,NRSV,this is not what abraham did,you are indeed doing what your father does,0,JHN.8
3218,JHN,8,NRSV,you are indeed doing what your father does,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,0,JHN.8
3219,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,and besides other things i am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches,1,JHN.8
3220,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here,humble yourselves before the lord and he will exalt you,1,JHN.8
3221,JHN,8,NRSV,i did not come on my own but he sent me,why do you not understand what i say,0,JHN.8
3222,JHN,8,NRSV,why do you not understand what i say,it is because you cannot accept my word,0,JHN.8
3223,JHN,8,NRSV,it is because you cannot accept my word,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing,1,JHN.8
3224,JHN,8,NRSV,you are from your father the devil and you choose to do your fathers desires,he said to them you also go into the vineyard,1,JHN.8
3225,JHN,8,NRSV,he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,0,JHN.8
3226,JHN,8,NRSV,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,there is no restriction in our affections but only in yours,1,JHN.8
3227,JHN,8,NRSV,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me,which of you convicts me of sin,0,JHN.8
3228,JHN,8,NRSV,which of you convicts me of sin,you blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup so that the outside also may become clean,1,JHN.8
3229,JHN,8,NRSV,if i tell the truth why do you not believe me,keeping their distance they called out saying jesus master have mercy on us when he saw them he said to them go and show yourselves to the priests,1,JHN.8
3230,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever is from god hears the words of god,the reason you do not hear them is that you are not from god,0,JHN.8
3231,JHN,8,NRSV,the reason you do not hear them is that you are not from god,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,0,JHN.8
3232,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and they say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds,1,JHN.8
3233,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,0,JHN.8
3234,JHN,8,NRSV,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,now when these things begin to take place stand up and raise your heads because your redemption is drawing near,1,JHN.8
3235,JHN,8,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever keeps my word will never see death,the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon,0,JHN.8
3236,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,0,JHN.8
3237,JHN,8,NRSV,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,his parents answered we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but we do not know how it is that now he sees nor do we know who opened his eyes,1,JHN.8
3238,JHN,8,NRSV,are you greater than our father abraham who died,remember then from what you have fallen repent and do the works you did at first,1,JHN.8
3239,JHN,8,NRSV,who do you claim to be,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing,0,JHN.8
3240,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing,you have heard of the endurance of job and you have seen the purpose of the lord how the lord is compassionate and merciful,1,JHN.8
3241,JHN,8,NRSV,it is my father who glorifies me he of whom you say he is our god though you do not know him,but i know him if i would say that i do not know him i would be a liar like you,0,JHN.8
3242,JHN,8,NRSV,but i know him if i would say that i do not know him i would be a liar like you,but i do know him and i keep his word,0,JHN.8
3243,JHN,8,NRSV,but i do know him and i keep his word,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him,1,JHN.8
3244,JHN,8,NRSV,your ancestor abraham rejoiced that he would see my day he saw it and was glad,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,0,JHN.8
3245,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,jesus said to them very truly i tell you before abraham was i am,0,JHN.8
3246,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you before abraham was i am,for this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal,1,JHN.8
3247,JHN,8,NRSV,so they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple,as he walked along he saw a man blind from birth,0,JHN.8
3354,JHN,11,NRSV,now a certain man was ill lazarus of bethany the village of mary and her sister martha,that is to bring christ down or who will descend into the abyss,1,JHN.11
3355,JHN,11,NRSV,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill,they brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech and they begged him to lay his hand on him,1,JHN.11
3356,JHN,11,NRSV,so the sisters sent a message to jesus lord he whom you love is ill,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it,0,JHN.11
3357,JHN,11,NRSV,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it,then you will begin to say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets,1,JHN.11
3358,JHN,11,NRSV,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,the jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,1,JHN.11
3359,JHN,11,NRSV,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again,the disciples said to him rabbi the jews were just now trying to stone you and are you going there again,0,JHN.11
3360,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him rabbi the jews were just now trying to stone you and are you going there again,for the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands thus observing the tradition of the elders and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it and there are also many other traditions that they observe the washing of cups pots and bronze kettles,1,JHN.11
3361,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight,those who walk during the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world,0,JHN.11
3362,JHN,11,NRSV,those who walk during the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them,0,JHN.11
3363,JHN,11,NRSV,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them,now is the judgment of this world now the ruler of this world will be driven out,1,JHN.11
3364,JHN,11,NRSV,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him,this became known to all the residents of jerusalem so that the field was called in their language hakeldama that is field of blood for it is written in the book of psalms let his homestead become desolate and let there be no one to live in it and let another take his position of overseer,1,JHN.11
3365,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right,these are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast they will make war on the lamb and the lamb will conquer them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those with him are called and chosen and faithful,1,JHN.11
3366,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus however had been speaking about his death but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep,now many saw them going and recognized them and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them,1,JHN.11
3367,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus told them plainly lazarus is dead,he took with him peter and james and john and began to be distressed and agitated,1,JHN.11
3368,JHN,11,NRSV,for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe,even though they found no cause for a sentence of death they asked pilate to have him killed,1,JHN.11
3369,JHN,11,NRSV,but let us go to him,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god,1,JHN.11
3370,JHN,11,NRSV,thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days,0,JHN.11
3371,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,1,JHN.11
3372,JHN,11,NRSV,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles away and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,1,JHN.11
3373,JHN,11,NRSV,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,1,JHN.11
3374,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ,1,JHN.11
3375,JHN,11,NRSV,but even now i know that god will give you whatever you ask of him,jesus said to her your brother will rise again,0,JHN.11
3376,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her your brother will rise again,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,0,JHN.11
3377,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,i wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness,1,JHN.11
3378,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life,and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,1,JHN.11
3379,JHN,11,NRSV,those who believe in me even though they die will live and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die,she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the messiah the son of god the one coming into the world,0,JHN.11
3380,JHN,11,NRSV,she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the messiah the son of god the one coming into the world,but the one who endures to the end will be saved,1,JHN.11
3381,JHN,11,NRSV,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you,about noon the next day as they were on their journey and approaching the city peter went up on the roof to pray,1,JHN.11
3382,JHN,11,NRSV,and when she heard it she got up quickly and went to him,give us this day our daily bread,1,JHN.11
3383,JHN,11,NRSV,now jesus had not yet come to the village but was still at the place where martha had met him,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out,0,JHN.11
3384,JHN,11,NRSV,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out,for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of god if it begins with us what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of god,1,JHN.11
3385,JHN,11,NRSV,they followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,0,JHN.11
3386,JHN,11,NRSV,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved,0,JHN.11
3387,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved,he said where have you laid him,0,JHN.11
3388,JHN,11,NRSV,he said where have you laid him,and the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour together with the beast,1,JHN.11
3389,JHN,11,NRSV,they said to him lord come and see,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,0,JHN.11
3390,JHN,11,NRSV,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,although i have much to write to you i would rather not use paper and ink instead i hope to come to you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete,1,JHN.11
3391,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus again greatly disturbed came to the tomb,it was a cave and a stone was lying against it,0,JHN.11
3392,JHN,11,NRSV,it was a cave and a stone was lying against it,or look at ships though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs,1,JHN.11
3393,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said take away the stone,martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days,0,JHN.11
3394,JHN,11,NRSV,martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days,jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god,0,JHN.11
3395,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god,he unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor,1,JHN.11
3396,JHN,11,NRSV,so they took away the stone,and if anyone says to you at that time look here is the messiah or look there he isdo not believe it,1,JHN.11
3397,JHN,11,NRSV,and jesus looked upward and said father i thank you for having heard me,they said to him lord let our eyes be opened,1,JHN.11
3398,JHN,11,NRSV,i knew that you always hear me but i have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again,1,JHN.11
3399,JHN,11,NRSV,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,jesus said to them unbind him and let him go,0,JHN.11
3400,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to them unbind him and let him go,he answered here i am lord,1,JHN.11
3401,JHN,11,NRSV,many of the jews therefore who had come with mary and had seen what jesus did believed in him,then from the smoke came locusts on the earth and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth,1,JHN.11
3402,JHN,11,NRSV,but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what he had done,so the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the council and said what are we to do,0,JHN.11
3403,JHN,11,NRSV,so the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the council and said what are we to do,this man is performing many signs,0,JHN.11
3404,JHN,11,NRSV,this man is performing many signs,the next day he got up and went with them and some of the believers from joppa accompanied him,1,JHN.11
3405,JHN,11,NRSV,if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation,but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all you do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed,0,JHN.11
3406,JHN,11,NRSV,but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all you do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed,as you know we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of god who calls you into his own kingdom and glory,1,JHN.11
3407,JHN,11,NRSV,he did not say this on his own but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus was about to die for the nation and not for the nation only but to gather into one the dispersed children of god,after this the lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go,1,JHN.11
3408,JHN,11,NRSV,so from that day on they planned to put him to death,jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the jews but went from there to a town called ephraim in the region near the wilderness and he remained there with the disciples,0,JHN.11
3409,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the jews but went from there to a town called ephraim in the region near the wilderness and he remained there with the disciples,do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham,1,JHN.11
3410,JHN,11,NRSV,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called,1,JHN.11
3411,JHN,11,NRSV,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think,for all of us make many mistakes,1,JHN.11
3412,JHN,11,NRSV,surely he will not come to the festival will he,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,0,JHN.11
3413,JHN,11,NRSV,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,and you who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,1,JHN.11
3469,JHN,13,NRSV,now before the festival of the passover jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the father,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,0,JHN.13
3470,JHN,13,NRSV,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,the devil had already put it into the heart of judas son of simon iscariot to betray him,0,JHN.13
3471,JHN,13,NRSV,the devil had already put it into the heart of judas son of simon iscariot to betray him,for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive,1,JHN.13
3472,JHN,13,NRSV,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him,0,JHN.13
3473,JHN,13,NRSV,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him,but they did not understand what he said to them,1,JHN.13
3474,JHN,13,NRSV,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand,0,JHN.13
3475,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand,but the lord is faithful he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one,1,JHN.13
3476,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him you will never wash my feet,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,1,JHN.13
3477,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me,then another angel came out of the temple in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle,1,JHN.13
3478,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him one who has bathed does not need to wash except for the feet but is entirely clean,and you are clean though not all of you,0,JHN.13
3479,JHN,13,NRSV,and you are clean though not all of you,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,0,JHN.13
3480,JHN,13,NRSV,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,0,JHN.13
3481,JHN,13,NRSV,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,for they could not endure the order that was given if even an animal touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death,1,JHN.13
3482,JHN,13,NRSV,you call me teacher and lordand you are right for that is what i am,for in every city for generations past moses has had those who proclaim him for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues,1,JHN.13
3483,JHN,13,NRSV,so if i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,0,JHN.13
3484,JHN,13,NRSV,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism,1,JHN.13
3485,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,there is on the one hand the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual for the law made nothing perfect there is on the other hand the introduction of a better hope through which we approach god,1,JHN.13
3486,JHN,13,NRSV,if you know these things you are blessed if you do them,because you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hates you,1,JHN.13
3487,JHN,13,NRSV,i am not speaking of all of you i know whom i have chosen,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me,0,JHN.13
3488,JHN,13,NRSV,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he,0,JHN.13
3489,JHN,13,NRSV,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me,0,JHN.13
3490,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me,from there he set out and went away to the region of tyre,1,JHN.13
3491,JHN,13,NRSV,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me,the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he was speaking,0,JHN.13
3492,JHN,13,NRSV,the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he was speaking,at the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steeringoars then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach,1,JHN.13
3493,JHN,13,NRSV,one of his disciplesthe one whom jesus lovedwas reclining next to him simon peter therefore motioned to him to ask jesus of whom he was speaking,believe in god believe also in me,1,JHN.13
3494,JHN,13,NRSV,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,jesus answered it is the one to whom i give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish,0,JHN.13
3495,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered it is the one to whom i give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish,so when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot,0,JHN.13
3496,JHN,13,NRSV,so when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot,after he received the piece of bread satan entered into him,0,JHN.13
3497,JHN,13,NRSV,after he received the piece of bread satan entered into him,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do,0,JHN.13
3498,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do,then indeed the house can be plundered,1,JHN.13
3499,JHN,13,NRSV,now no one at the table knew why he said this to him,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor,0,JHN.13
3500,JHN,13,NRSV,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out,0,JHN.13
3501,JHN,13,NRSV,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him,0,JHN.13
3502,JHN,13,NRSV,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him,do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth i have not come to bring peace but a sword,1,JHN.13

3693,JHN,18,NRSV,one of the slaves of the high priest a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off asked did i not see you in the garden with him,for they are not permitted to speak but should be subordinate as the law also says,1,JHN.18
3694,JHN,18,NRSV,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed,then they took jesus from caiaphas to pilates headquarters,0,JHN.18

5458,1CO,8,NRSV,for if others see you who possess knowledge eating in the temple of an idol might they not since their conscience is weak be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed,0,1CO.8
5459,1CO,8,NRSV,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed,but when you thus sin against members of your family and wound their conscience when it is weak you sin against christ,0,1CO.8

5656,1CO,15,NRSV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me has not been in vain,by faith moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth because they saw that the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the kings edict,1,1CO.15
5657,1CO,15,NRSV,on the contrary i worked harder than any of themthough it was not i but the grace of god that is with me,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe,0,1CO.15

5659,1CO,15,NRSV,now if christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead,jesus answered them did i not choose you the twelve,1,1CO.15

5661,1CO,15,NRSV,we are even found to be misrepresenting god because we testified of god that he raised christwhom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised,0,1CO.15

5664,1CO,15,NRSV,then those also who have died in christ have perished,instead you ought to say if the lord wishes we will live and do this or that,1,1CO.15
5665,1CO,15,NRSV,if for this life only we have hoped in christ we are of all people most to be pitied,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart,1,1CO.15
5666,1CO,15,NRSV,but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have died,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ,0,1CO.15
5667,1CO,15,NRSV,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ,but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at his coming those who belong to christ,0,1CO.15

5673,1CO,15,NRSV,but when it says all things are put in subjection it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,1,1CO.15
5674,1CO,15,NRSV,when all things are subjected to him then the son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him so that god may be all in all,but if christ is in you though the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness,1,1CO.15
5675,1CO,15,NRSV,otherwise what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead,do not be ashamed then of the testimony about our lord or of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel relying on the power of god who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace,1,1CO.15

5688,1CO,15,NRSV,but god gives it a body as he has chosen and to each kind of seed its own body,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish,0,1CO.15

5769,2CO,2,NRSV,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him,for we are the aroma of christ to god among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing to the one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life,0,2CO.2
5770,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are the aroma of christ to god among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing to the one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life,who is sufficient for these things,0,2CO.2
5771,2CO,2,NRSV,who is sufficient for these things,but the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariah for your prayer has been heard,1,2CO.2
5772,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are not peddlers of gods word like so many but in christ we speak as persons of sincerity as persons sent from god and standing in his presence,caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it was better to have one person die for the people,1,2CO.2
5773,2CO,3,NRSV,are we beginning to commend ourselves again,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,0,2CO.3
5774,2CO,3,NRSV,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,for if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries,1,2CO.3
5775,2CO,3,NRSV,you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts to be known and read by all and you show that you are a letter of christ prepared by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons,1,2CO.3
5776,2CO,3,NRSV,such is the confidence that we have through christ toward god,the rain fell the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on rock,1,2CO.3
5777,2CO,3,NRSV,not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us our competence is from god who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not of letter but of spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life,now if the ministry of death chiseled in letters on stone tablets came in glory so that the people of israel could not gaze at moses face because of the glory of his face a glory now set aside how much more will the ministry of the spirit come in glory,0,2CO.3
5778,2CO,3,NRSV,now if the ministry of death chiseled in letters on stone tablets came in glory so that the people of israel could not gaze at moses face because of the glory of his face a glory now set aside how much more will the ministry of the spirit come in glory,he said to them it is one of the twelve one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me,1,2CO.3
5779,2CO,3,NRSV,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside,he began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained the way of god to him more accurately,1,2CO.3
5780,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day when they hear the reading of the old covenant that same veil is still there since only in christ is it set aside,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1,2CO.3
5781,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom,0,2CO.3
5782,2CO,3,NRSV,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit,0,2CO.3
5783,2CO,3,NRSV,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit,therefore since it is by gods mercy that we are engaged in this ministry we do not lose heart,0,2CO.3
5799,2CO,5,NRSV,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked,0,2CO.5
5800,2CO,5,NRSV,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked,but we have this treasure in clay jars so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to god and does not come from us,1,2CO.5
5801,2CO,5,NRSV,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life,therefore encourage one another with these words,1,2CO.5
5802,2CO,5,NRSV,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee,to another he said follow me,1,2CO.5
5803,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight,yes we do have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord,0,2CO.5
5804,2CO,5,NRSV,yes we do have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord,about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them,1,2CO.5
5805,2CO,5,NRSV,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,for all of us must appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body whether good or evil,0,2CO.5
5806,2CO,5,NRSV,for all of us must appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body whether good or evil,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them,1,2CO.5
5807,2CO,5,NRSV,therefore knowing the fear of the lord we try to persuade others but we ourselves are well known to god and i hope that we are also well known to your consciences,they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost,1,2CO.5
5808,2CO,5,NRSV,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,for if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right mind it is for you,0,2CO.5
5809,2CO,5,NRSV,for if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right mind it is for you,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,0,2CO.5
5810,2CO,5,NRSV,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them,0,2CO.5
5811,2CO,5,NRSV,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them,from now on therefore we regard no one from a human point of view even though we once knew christ from a human point of view we know him no longer in that way,0,2CO.5
5812,2CO,5,NRSV,from now on therefore we regard no one from a human point of view even though we once knew christ from a human point of view we know him no longer in that way,then peter said can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the holy spirit just as we have,1,2CO.5
5813,2CO,5,NRSV,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god,0,2CO.5
5814,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters,1,2CO.5
5815,2CO,5,NRSV,for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god,as we work together with him we urge you also not to accept the grace of god in vain,0,2CO.5
5831,2CO,7,NRSV,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness,1,2CO.7
5832,2CO,7,NRSV,make room in your hearts for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together,0,2CO.7
5833,2CO,7,NRSV,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together,this is my message for you,1,2CO.7
5834,2CO,7,NRSV,i often boast about you i have great pride in you i am filled with consolation i am overjoyed in all our affliction,but if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but to some extentnot to exaggerate itto all of you,1,2CO.7
5835,2CO,7,NRSV,for even when we came into macedonia our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted in every waydisputes without and fears within,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil,1,2CO.7
5836,2CO,7,NRSV,but god who consoles the downcast consoled us by the arrival of titus and not only by his coming but also by the consolation with which he was consoled about you as he told us of your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that i rejoiced still more,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and his brother john and led them up a high mountain by themselves,1,2CO.7
5837,2CO,7,NRSV,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly,greet prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus,1,2CO.7
5838,2CO,7,NRSV,now i rejoice not because you were grieved but because your grief led to repentance for you felt a godly grief so that you were not harmed in any way by us,by no means although everyone is a liar let god be proved true as it is written so that you may be justified in your words and prevail in your judging,1,2CO.7
5839,2CO,7,NRSV,for godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret but worldly grief produces death,but jesus said someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me,1,2CO.7
5840,2CO,7,NRSV,for see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what zeal what punishment at every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god,0,2CO.7
5841,2CO,7,NRSV,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,1,2CO.7
5842,2CO,7,NRSV,in addition to our own consolation we rejoiced still more at the joy of titus because his mind has been set at rest by all of you,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well,0,2CO.7
5843,2CO,7,NRSV,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well,be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life,1,2CO.7
5844,2CO,7,NRSV,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you,0,2CO.7
5845,2CO,7,NRSV,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you,we want you to know brothers and sisters about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part,0,2CO.7
6113,EPH,2,NRSV,you were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived following the course of this world following the ruler of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient,when she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the coin that i had lost,1,EPH.2
6114,EPH,2,NRSV,all of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh following the desires of flesh and senses and we were by nature children of wrath like everyone else,in his right hand he held seven stars and from his mouth came a sharp twoedged sword and his face was like the sun shining with full force,1,EPH.2
6115,EPH,2,NRSV,but god who is rich in mercy out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast,0,EPH.2
6116,EPH,2,NRSV,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain,1,EPH.2
6117,EPH,2,NRSV,for we are what he has made us created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand to be our way of life,get up be baptized and have your sins washed away calling on his name,1,EPH.2
6118,EPH,2,NRSV,so then remember that at one time you gentiles by birth called the uncircumcision by those who are called the circumcisiona physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands remember that you were at that time without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers to the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world,stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality,1,EPH.2
6119,EPH,2,NRSV,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,but even if i am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me,1,EPH.2
6120,EPH,2,NRSV,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the lords favor,1,EPH.2
6121,EPH,2,NRSV,he has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two thus making peace and might reconcile both groups to god in one body through the cross thus putting to death that hostility through it,and i saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,1,EPH.2
6122,EPH,2,NRSV,so he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near for through him both of us have access in one spirit to the father,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone,0,EPH.2
6123,EPH,2,NRSV,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone,he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness,1,EPH.2
6124,EPH,2,NRSV,in him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for god,this is the reason that i paul am a prisoner for christ jesus for the sake of you gentiles for surely you have already heard of the commission of gods grace that was given me for you and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation as i wrote above in a few words a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of christ,0,EPH.2
6135,EPH,4,NRSV,i therefore the prisoner in the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in all,0,EPH.4
6136,EPH,4,NRSV,there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in all,when they arrived they called the church together and related all that god had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles,1,EPH.4
6137,EPH,4,NRSV,but each of us was given grace according to the measure of christs gift,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,1,EPH.4
6138,EPH,4,NRSV,therefore it is said when he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive he gave gifts to his people,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they are no more,1,EPH.4
6139,EPH,4,NRSV,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth,when he laid his hands on her immediately she stood up straight and began praising god,1,EPH.4
6140,EPH,4,NRSV,he who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things the gifts he gave were that some would be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of christ until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to maturity to the measure of the full stature of christ,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love,1,EPH.4
6141,EPH,4,NRSV,we must no longer be children tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine by peoples trickery by their craftiness in deceitful scheming,but if there is no one to interpret let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to god,1,EPH.4
6142,EPH,4,NRSV,but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ from whom the whole body joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped as each part is working properly promotes the bodys growth in building itself up in love,then paul and his companions set sail from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia,1,EPH.4
6143,EPH,4,NRSV,now this i affirm and insist on in the lord you must no longer live as the gentiles live in the futility of their minds,they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of their ignorance and hardness of heart,0,EPH.4
6144,EPH,4,NRSV,they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of their ignorance and hardness of heart,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity,0,EPH.4
6145,EPH,4,NRSV,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1,EPH.4
6146,EPH,4,NRSV,that is not the way you learned christ for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness,0,EPH.4
6147,EPH,4,NRSV,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness,because you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hates you,1,EPH.4
6148,EPH,4,NRSV,so then putting away falsehood let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors for we are members of one another,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,0,EPH.4
6149,EPH,4,NRSV,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,i write to you children because you know the father,1,EPH.4
6150,EPH,4,NRSV,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,at once he came up to jesus and said greetings rabbi and kissed him,1,EPH.4
6151,EPH,4,NRSV,let no evil talk come out of your mouths but only what is useful for building up as there is need so that your words may give grace to those who hear,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,1,EPH.4
6152,EPH,4,NRSV,and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption,put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander together with all malice and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ has forgiven you,0,EPH.4
6153,EPH,4,NRSV,put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander together with all malice and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ has forgiven you,therefore be imitators of god as beloved children and live in love as christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god,0,EPH.4
6243,PHP,3,NRSV,finally my brothers and sisters rejoice in the lord,to write the same things to you is not troublesome to me and for you it is a safeguard,0,PHP.3
6244,PHP,3,NRSV,to write the same things to you is not troublesome to me and for you it is a safeguard,so they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus,1,PHP.3
6245,PHP,3,NRSV,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,0,PHP.3

6247,PHP,3,NRSV,yet whatever gains i had these i have come to regard as loss because of christ,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord,0,PHP.3
6248,PHP,3,NRSV,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord,for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and i regard them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but one that comes through faith in christ the righteousness from god based on faith,0,PHP.3
6249,PHP,3,NRSV,for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and i regard them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but one that comes through faith in christ the righteousness from god based on faith,see i am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves,1,PHP.3
6250,PHP,3,NRSV,i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead,and i said lord they themselves know that in every synagogue i imprisoned and beat those who believed in you,1,PHP.3
6251,PHP,3,NRSV,not that i have already obtained this or have already reached the goal but i press on to make it my own because christ jesus has made me his own,then they arrived at the country of the gerasenes which is opposite galilee,1,PHP.3
6252,PHP,3,NRSV,beloved i do not consider that i have made it my own but this one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead i press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of god in christ jesus,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you,0,PHP.3
6253,PHP,3,NRSV,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you,and let them first be tested then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons,1,PHP.3
6254,PHP,3,NRSV,only let us hold fast to what we have attained,brothers and sisters join in imitating me and observe those who live according to the example you have in us,0,PHP.3
