152,MAT,7,NRSV,do not judge so that you may not be judged,then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus have you no answer,1,MAT.7
153,MAT,7,NRSV,for with the judgment you make you will be judged and the measure you give will be the measure you get,little children let no one deceive you,1,MAT.7
154,MAT,7,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons,1,MAT.7
155,MAT,7,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor let me take the speck out of your eye while the log is in your own eye,so we can say with confidence the lord is my helper i will not be afraid,1,MAT.7
156,MAT,7,NRSV,you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors eye,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them,1,MAT.7
157,MAT,7,NRSV,do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,1,MAT.7
158,MAT,7,NRSV,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree,1,MAT.7
159,MAT,7,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come,1,MAT.7
160,MAT,7,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,for to those who have more will be given and from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1,MAT.7
161,MAT,7,NRSV,or if the child asks for a fish will give a snake,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death,1,MAT.7
162,MAT,7,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him in everything do to others as you would have them do to you for this is the law and the prophets,he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son of whom he had been told it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you,1,MAT.7
163,MAT,7,NRSV,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction and there are many who take it,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me,1,MAT.7
164,MAT,7,NRSV,for the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life and there are few who find it,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread,1,MAT.7
165,MAT,7,NRSV,beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves,they were asking for simons house and were standing by the gate,1,MAT.7
166,MAT,7,NRSV,you will know them by their fruits,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,1,MAT.7
167,MAT,7,NRSV,are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles,those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing,1,MAT.7
168,MAT,7,NRSV,in the same way every good tree bears good fruit but the bad tree bears bad fruit,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman,1,MAT.7
169,MAT,7,NRSV,a good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit,after greeting them he related one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry,1,MAT.7
170,MAT,7,NRSV,every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire,then isaiah is so bold as to say i have been found by those who did not seek me i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me,1,MAT.7
171,MAT,7,NRSV,thus you will know them by their fruits,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food,1,MAT.7
172,MAT,7,NRSV,not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will of my father in heaven,and how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him,1,MAT.7
173,MAT,7,NRSV,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,she said to them they have taken away my lord and i do not know where they have laid him,1,MAT.7
174,MAT,7,NRSV,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends,1,MAT.7
175,MAT,7,NRSV,everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices,1,MAT.7
176,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on rock,let us not become conceited competing against one another envying one another,1,MAT.7
177,MAT,7,NRSV,and everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor,1,MAT.7
178,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it felland great was its fall now when jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as their scribes,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday,1,MAT.7
367,MAT,13,NRSV,that same day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea,but they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified and their voices prevailed,1,MAT.13
368,MAT,13,NRSV,such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the whole crowd stood on the beach,no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us,1,MAT.13
369,MAT,13,NRSV,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light,1,MAT.13
370,MAT,13,NRSV,and as he sowed some seeds fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles,1,MAT.13
371,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and they sprang up quickly since they had no depth of soil,they marched up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,1,MAT.13
372,MAT,13,NRSV,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away,thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god,1,MAT.13
373,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god,1,MAT.13
374,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1,MAT.13
375,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen then the disciples came and asked him why do you speak to them in parables,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe,1,MAT.13
376,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given,jesus said to him go your son will live,1,MAT.13
377,MAT,13,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him,1,MAT.13
378,MAT,13,NRSV,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand,after jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum,1,MAT.13
379,MAT,13,NRSV,with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah that says you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive,since he was a prophet he knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne,1,MAT.13
380,MAT,13,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,and he ordered him to tell no one,1,MAT.13
381,MAT,13,NRSV,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name,1,MAT.13
382,MAT,13,NRSV,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,and jesus said to her woman what concern is that to you and to me,1,MAT.13
383,MAT,13,NRSV,hear then the parable of the sower,as he walked along he saw a man blind from birth,1,MAT.13
384,MAT,13,NRSV,when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path,now i would remind you brothers and sisters of the good news that i proclaimed to you which you in turn received in which also you stand through which also you are being saved if you hold firmly to the message that i proclaimed to youunless you have come to believe in vain,1,MAT.13
385,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away,if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords,1,MAT.13
386,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb,1,MAT.13
387,MAT,13,NRSV,but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty,then they said to him what must we do to perform the works of god,1,MAT.13
388,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away,he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might come to have first place in everything,1,MAT.13
389,MAT,13,NRSV,so when the plants came up and bore grain then the weeds appeared as well,with this in mind i was traveling to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests when at midday along the road your excellency i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions,1,MAT.13
390,MAT,13,NRSV,and the slaves of the householder came and said to him master did you not sow good seed in your field,when the angel who spoke to him had left he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him and after telling them everything he sent them to joppa,1,MAT.13
391,MAT,13,NRSV,where then did these weeds come from,yet if you say so i will let down the nets,1,MAT.13
392,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered an enemy has done this,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,1,MAT.13
393,MAT,13,NRSV,the slaves said to him then do you want us to go and gather them,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught,1,MAT.13
394,MAT,13,NRSV,but he replied no for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them,and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb great and amazing are your deeds lord god the almighty just and true are your ways king of the nations lord who will not fear and glorify your name,1,MAT.13
395,MAT,13,NRSV,let both of them grow together until the harvest and at harvest time i will tell the reapers collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn,look the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out,1,MAT.13
396,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches,if timothy comes see that he has nothing to fear among you for he is doing the work of the lord just as i am therefore let no one despise him,1,MAT.13
397,MAT,13,NRSV,he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil,1,MAT.13
398,MAT,13,NRSV,jesus told the crowds all these things in parables without a parable he told them nothing,they said moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her,1,MAT.13
399,MAT,13,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet i will open my mouth to speak in parables i will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world,pilate asked him what is truth,1,MAT.13
400,MAT,13,NRSV,then he left the crowds and went into the house,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning,1,MAT.13
401,MAT,13,NRSV,and his disciples approached him saying explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified,1,MAT.13
402,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered the one who sows the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels,when they asked him to stay longer he declined but on taking leave of them he said i will return to you if god wills,1,MAT.13
403,MAT,13,NRSV,just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age,and he did the same with the cup after supper saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood,1,MAT.13
404,MAT,13,NRSV,the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers and they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison,1,MAT.13
405,MAT,13,NRSV,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father,for who can resist his will,1,MAT.13
406,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,so whenever you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be praised by others,1,MAT.13
407,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it,first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone for kings and all who are in high positions so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity,1,MAT.13
408,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind when it was full they drew it ashore sat down and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well,1,MAT.13
409,MAT,13,NRSV,so it will be at the end of the age,and the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,1,MAT.13
410,MAT,13,NRSV,the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,1,MAT.13
411,MAT,13,NRSV,and he said to them therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore,1,MAT.13
412,MAT,13,NRSV,when jesus had finished these parables he left that place,pilate asked him what is truth,1,MAT.13
413,MAT,13,NRSV,he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power,they who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me and those who love me will be loved by my father and i will love them and reveal myself to them,1,MAT.13
414,MAT,13,NRSV,is not this the carpenters son,a jar full of sour wine was standing there,1,MAT.13
415,MAT,13,NRSV,is not his mother called mary,he was trying to see who jesus was but on account of the crowd he could not because he was short in stature,1,MAT.13
416,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee,1,MAT.13
417,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not all his sisters with us,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love,1,MAT.13
418,MAT,13,NRSV,where then did this man get all this,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1,MAT.13
419,MAT,13,NRSV,and they took offense at him,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death,1,MAT.13
420,MAT,13,NRSV,but jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years,1,MAT.13
421,MAT,13,NRSV,and he did not do many deeds of power there because of their unbelief,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him,1,MAT.13
552,MAT,18,NRSV,at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,but the one to whom little is forgiven loves little,1,MAT.18
553,MAT,18,NRSV,he called a child whom he put among them and said truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler and saul,1,MAT.18
554,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,1,MAT.18
555,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,1,MAT.18
556,MAT,18,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea,blessed are you who are hungry now for you will be filled,1,MAT.18
557,MAT,18,NRSV,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded,1,MAT.18
558,MAT,18,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,1,MAT.18
559,MAT,18,NRSV,take care that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you in heaven their angels continually see the face of my father in heaven,they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people,1,MAT.18
560,MAT,18,NRSV,if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,1,MAT.18
561,MAT,18,NRSV,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise,1,MAT.18
562,MAT,18,NRSV,so it is not the will of your father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost,she said this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people,1,MAT.18
563,MAT,18,NRSV,if another member of the church sins against you go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone,what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me,1,MAT.18
564,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member listens to you you have regained that one,simon answered i suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt,1,MAT.18
565,MAT,18,NRSV,but if you are not listened to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses,then he sent another and that one they killed,1,MAT.18
566,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church let such a one be to you as a gentile and a tax collector,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves,1,MAT.18
567,MAT,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived,1,MAT.18
568,MAT,18,NRSV,again truly i tell you if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven,we declare to you what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life this life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it and declare to you the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ,1,MAT.18
569,MAT,18,NRSV,for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me,1,MAT.18
570,MAT,18,NRSV,then peter came and said to him lord if another member of the church sins against me how often should i forgive,then they secretly instigated some men to say we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god,1,MAT.18
571,MAT,18,NRSV,jesus said to him not seven times but i tell you seventyseven times,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things,1,MAT.18
572,MAT,18,NRSV,for this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves,for i have come to call not the righteous but sinners,1,MAT.18
573,MAT,18,NRSV,when he began the reckoning one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him and as he could not pay his lord ordered him to be sold together with his wife and children and all his possessions and payment to be made,it read jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,1,MAT.18
574,MAT,18,NRSV,so the slave fell on his knees before him saying have patience with me and i will pay you everything,his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,1,MAT.18
575,MAT,18,NRSV,and out of pity for him the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt,no one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light,1,MAT.18
576,MAT,18,NRSV,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,for it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth,1,MAT.18
577,MAT,18,NRSV,then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him have patience with me and i will pay you,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it,1,MAT.18
578,MAT,18,NRSV,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt,his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth,1,MAT.18
579,MAT,18,NRSV,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,so give recognition to such persons,1,MAT.18
580,MAT,18,NRSV,then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me,we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete,1,MAT.18
581,MAT,18,NRSV,should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave as i had mercy on you,and the whole city was gathered around the door,1,MAT.18
582,MAT,18,NRSV,and in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,1,MAT.18
583,MAT,18,NRSV,so my heavenly father will also do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,1,MAT.18
1117,MRK,4,NRSV,again he began to teach beside the sea,therefore i tell you people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven,1,MRK.4
1118,MRK,4,NRSV,such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land,a man had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work in the vineyard today,1,MRK.4
1119,MRK,4,NRSV,he began to teach them many things in parables and in his teaching he said to them listen a sower went out to sow,at this they were overcome with amazement,1,MRK.4
1120,MRK,4,NRSV,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for,1,MRK.4
1121,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and it sprang up quickly since it had no depth of soil,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,1,MRK.4
1122,MRK,4,NRSV,and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away,but he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert and house falls on house,1,MRK.4
1123,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain,there is only one who is good,1,MRK.4
1124,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me,1,MRK.4
1125,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said let anyone with ears to hear listen when he was alone those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables,for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed,1,MRK.4
1126,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them to you has been given the secret of the kingdom of god but for those outside everything comes in parables in order that they may indeed look but not perceive and may indeed listen but not understand so that they may not turn again and be forgiven,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead,1,MRK.4
1127,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them do you not understand this parable,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,1,MRK.4
1128,MRK,4,NRSV,then how will you understand all the parables,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy,1,MRK.4
1129,MRK,4,NRSV,these are the ones on the path where the word is sown when they hear satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,1,MRK.4
1130,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on rocky ground when they hear the word they immediately receive it with joy,for those who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to god for nobody understands them since they are speaking mysteries in the spirit,1,MRK.4
1131,MRK,4,NRSV,but they have no root and endure only for a while then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word immediately they fall away,likewise tell the older women to be reverent in behavior not to be slanderers or slaves to drink they are to teach what is good so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children to be selfcontrolled chaste good managers of the household kind being submissive to their husbands so that the word of god may not be discredited,1,MRK.4
1132,MRK,4,NRSV,and others are those sown among the thorns these are the ones who hear the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word and it yields nothing,he did not wish to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him,1,MRK.4
1133,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on the good soil they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold,so let us not grow weary in doing what is right for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up,1,MRK.4
1134,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket or under the bed and not on the lampstand,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection,1,MRK.4
1135,MRK,4,NRSV,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light,peace to all of you who are in christ,1,MRK.4
1136,MRK,4,NRSV,let anyone with ears to hear listen and he said to them pay attention to what you hear the measure you give will be the measure you get and still more will be given you,and everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven,1,MRK.4
1137,MRK,4,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing,1,MRK.4
1138,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how,now the apostles and the believers who were in judea heard that the gentiles had also accepted the word of god,1,MRK.4
1139,MRK,4,NRSV,the earth produces of itself first the stalk then the head then the full grain in the head,you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment,1,MRK.4
1140,MRK,4,NRSV,but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,1,MRK.4
1141,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,jesus answered them do not complain among yourselves,1,MRK.4
1142,MRK,4,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade,then certain individuals came down from judea and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved,1,MRK.4
1143,MRK,4,NRSV,with many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it he did not speak to them except in parables but he explained everything in private to his disciples,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you,1,MRK.4
1144,MRK,4,NRSV,on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go across to the other side,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,1,MRK.4
1145,MRK,4,NRSV,and leaving the crowd behind they took him with them in the boat just as he was,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work,1,MRK.4
1146,MRK,4,NRSV,a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was already being swamped,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh,1,MRK.4
1147,MRK,4,NRSV,but he was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are perishing,there are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one thing and that of the earthly is another,1,MRK.4
1148,MRK,4,NRSV,he woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be still then the wind ceased and there was a dead calm,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead,1,MRK.4
1149,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them why are you afraid,for this reason i sent you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church,1,MRK.4
1150,MRK,4,NRSV,and they were filled with great awe and said to one another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him,do not fear what you are about to suffer,1,MRK.4
1194,MRK,6,NRSV,he left that place and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him,now that day was a sabbath,1,MRK.6
1195,MRK,6,NRSV,on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astounded,the king was grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he commanded it to be given he sent and had john beheaded in the prison,1,MRK.6
1196,MRK,6,NRSV,they said where did this man get all this,if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your mind,1,MRK.6
1197,MRK,6,NRSV,what is this wisdom that has been given to him,we want you to know brothers and sisters about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part,1,MRK.6
1198,MRK,6,NRSV,what deeds of power are being done by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us,like obedient children do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance,1,MRK.6
1199,MRK,6,NRSV,and they took offense at him,they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to dieyet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them,1,MRK.6
1200,MRK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,1,MRK.6
1201,MRK,6,NRSV,and he could do no deed of power there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them,this is the reason that i have so often been hindered from coming to you,1,MRK.6
1202,MRK,6,NRSV,and he was amazed at their unbelief,but you have kept the good wine until now,1,MRK.6
1203,MRK,6,NRSV,then he went about among the villages teaching,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this,1,MRK.6
1204,MRK,6,NRSV,he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying,1,MRK.6
1205,MRK,6,NRSV,he ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics,then turning toward the woman he said to simon do you see this woman,1,MRK.6
1206,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place,i went up in response to a revelation,1,MRK.6
1207,MRK,6,NRSV,if any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you as you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them,no not at all for we have already charged that all both jews and greeks are under the power of sin as it is written there is no one who is righteous not even one there is no one who has understanding there is no one who seeks god,1,MRK.6
1208,MRK,6,NRSV,so they went out and proclaimed that all should repent,he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery,1,MRK.6
1209,MRK,6,NRSV,they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them,he stretched it out and his hand was restored,1,MRK.6
1210,MRK,6,NRSV,king herod heard of it for jesus name had become known,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it,1,MRK.6
1211,MRK,6,NRSV,some were saying john the baptizer has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them,1,MRK.6
1212,MRK,6,NRSV,but others said it is elijah,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1,MRK.6
1213,MRK,6,NRSV,and others said it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old,now the works of the flesh are obvious fornication impurity licentiousness idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousy anger quarrels dissensions factions envy drunkenness carousing and things like these,1,MRK.6
1214,MRK,6,NRSV,but when herod heard of it he said john whom i beheaded has been raised,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments,1,MRK.6
1215,MRK,6,NRSV,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod had married her,in the days of king herod of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of abijah,1,MRK.6
1216,MRK,6,NRSV,for john had been telling herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife,so he got into the boat and returned,1,MRK.6
1217,MRK,6,NRSV,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him,when he had said this he died,1,MRK.6
1218,MRK,6,NRSV,but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and he protected him,there are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world and nothing is without sound,1,MRK.6
1219,MRK,6,NRSV,when he heard him he was greatly perplexed and yet he liked to listen to him,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,1,MRK.6
1220,MRK,6,NRSV,but an opportunity came when herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of galilee,and there appeared to them elijah with moses who were talking with jesus,1,MRK.6
1221,MRK,6,NRSV,when his daughter herodias came in and danced she pleased herod and his guests and the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you wish and i will give it,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,1,MRK.6
1222,MRK,6,NRSV,and he solemnly swore to her whatever you ask me i will give you even half of my kingdom,carry no purse no bag no sandals and greet no one on the road,1,MRK.6
1223,MRK,6,NRSV,she went out and said to her mother what should i ask for,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you,1,MRK.6
1224,MRK,6,NRSV,she replied the head of john the baptizer,if i have told you about earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if i tell you about heavenly things,1,MRK.6
1225,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately she rushed back to the king and requested i want you to give me at once the head of john the baptist on a platter,these six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the mans house,1,MRK.6
1226,MRK,6,NRSV,the king was deeply grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he did not want to refuse her,so those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them,1,MRK.6
1227,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring johns head,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,1,MRK.6
1228,MRK,6,NRSV,he went and beheaded him in the prison brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl,and to what should i compare it,1,MRK.6
1229,MRK,6,NRSV,then the girl gave it to her mother,since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous because even the fast had already gone by paul advised them saying sirs i can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives,1,MRK.6
1230,MRK,6,NRSV,when his disciples heard about it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb,they went to him and woke him up shouting master master we are perishing and he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves they ceased and there was a calm,1,MRK.6
1231,MRK,6,NRSV,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught,peter began to say to him look we have left everything and followed you,1,MRK.6
1232,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become,1,MRK.6
1233,MRK,6,NRSV,for many were coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat,or why are you speaking with her,1,MRK.6
1234,MRK,6,NRSV,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight,1,MRK.6
1235,MRK,6,NRSV,now many saw them going and recognized them and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground,1,MRK.6
1236,MRK,6,NRSV,as he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things,but they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony for they did not cling to life even in the face of death,1,MRK.6
1237,MRK,6,NRSV,when it grew late his disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now very late send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy something for themselves to eat,we are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not driven to despair persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed always carrying in the body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be made visible in our bodies,1,MRK.6
1238,MRK,6,NRSV,but he answered them you give them something to eat,and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full,1,MRK.6
1239,MRK,6,NRSV,they said to him are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat,jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of caesarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples who do people say that i am,1,MRK.6
1240,MRK,6,NRSV,and he said to them how many loaves have you,blessed are those who wash their robes so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates,1,MRK.6
1241,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had found out they said five and two fish,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up,1,MRK.6
1242,MRK,6,NRSV,then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass,but nothing unclean will enter it nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood but only those who are written in the lambs book of life,1,MRK.6
1243,MRK,6,NRSV,so they sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments,1,MRK.6
1244,MRK,6,NRSV,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and he divided the two fish among them all,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked,1,MRK.6
1245,MRK,6,NRSV,and all ate and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish,for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ,1,MRK.6
1246,MRK,6,NRSV,those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men,when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul,1,MRK.6
1247,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd,when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch,1,MRK.6
1248,MRK,6,NRSV,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,but i will warn you whom to fear fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell,1,MRK.6
1249,MRK,6,NRSV,when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land,do you have eyes and fail to see,1,MRK.6
1250,MRK,6,NRSV,when he saw that they were straining at the oars against an adverse wind he came towards them early in the morning walking on the sea,was not our ancestor abraham justified by works when he offered his son isaac on the altar,1,MRK.6
1251,MRK,6,NRSV,he intended to pass them by,now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding and the unclean spirits begged him send us into the swine let us enter them,1,MRK.6
1252,MRK,6,NRSV,but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and cried out for they all saw him and were terrified,you have laid up treasure for the last days,1,MRK.6
1253,MRK,6,NRSV,but immediately he spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,1,MRK.6
1254,MRK,6,NRSV,then he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased,jesus said to him stand up take your mat and walk,1,MRK.6
1255,MRK,6,NRSV,and they were utterly astounded for they did not understand about the loaves but their hearts were hardened,as they came near the village to which they were going he walked ahead as if he were going on,1,MRK.6
1256,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret and moored the boat,this calls for a mind that has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated also they are seven kings of whom five have fallen one is living and the other has not yet come and when he comes he must remain only a little while,1,MRK.6
1257,MRK,6,NRSV,when they got out of the boat people at once recognized him and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was,and he said to me these words are trustworthy and true for the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place,1,MRK.6
1258,MRK,6,NRSV,and wherever he went into villages or cities or farms they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,1,MRK.6
1461,MRK,12,NRSV,then he began to speak to them in parables,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days,1,MRK.12
1462,MRK,12,NRSV,a man planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a pit for the wine press and built a watchtower then he leased it to tenants and went to another country,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,1,MRK.12
1463,MRK,12,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard,otherwise if you say a blessing with the spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the amen to your thanksgiving since the outsider does not know what you are saying,1,MRK.12
1464,MRK,12,NRSV,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,but when you are invited go and sit down at the lowest place so that when your host comes he may say to you friend move up higher then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you,1,MRK.12
1465,MRK,12,NRSV,and again he sent another slave to them this one they beat over the head and insulted,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,1,MRK.12
1466,MRK,12,NRSV,then he sent another and that one they killed,until i arrive give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhorting to teaching,1,MRK.12
1467,MRK,12,NRSV,and so it was with many others some they beat and others they killed,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god,1,MRK.12
1468,MRK,12,NRSV,he had still one other a beloved son,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior,1,MRK.12
1469,MRK,12,NRSV,finally he sent him to them saying they will respect my son,for you will be speaking into the air,1,MRK.12
1470,MRK,12,NRSV,but those tenants said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that,1,MRK.12
1471,MRK,12,NRSV,so they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard,finally beloved whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever is commendable if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things,1,MRK.12
1472,MRK,12,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened,1,MRK.12
1473,MRK,12,NRSV,he will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others,now discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it,1,MRK.12
1474,MRK,12,NRSV,have you not read this scripture the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the lords doing and it is amazing in our eyes,then he left the country of the chaldeans and settled in haran,1,MRK.12
1475,MRK,12,NRSV,when they realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowd,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me,1,MRK.12
1476,MRK,12,NRSV,so they left him and went away,and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority,1,MRK.12
1477,MRK,12,NRSV,then they sent to him some pharisees and some herodians to trap him in what he said,then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there and he said it is written my house shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers,1,MRK.12
1478,MRK,12,NRSV,and they came and said to him teacher we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with truth,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1,MRK.12
1479,MRK,12,NRSV,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not,they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah who is over all god blessed forever,1,MRK.12
1480,MRK,12,NRSV,should we pay them or should we not,for to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away,1,MRK.12
1481,MRK,12,NRSV,but knowing their hypocrisy he said to them why are you putting me to the test,many of them were saying he has a demon and is out of his mind,1,MRK.12
1482,MRK,12,NRSV,bring me a denarius and let me see it,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1,MRK.12
1483,MRK,12,NRSV,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1,MRK.12
1484,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods,when the people saw the sign that he had done they began to say this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world,1,MRK.12
1485,MRK,12,NRSV,and they were utterly amazed at him,they said lord look here are two swords,1,MRK.12
1486,MRK,12,NRSV,some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question saying teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no child the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,and all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple,1,MRK.12
1487,MRK,12,NRSV,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise none of the seven left children,when peter saw it he addressed the people you israelites why do you wonder at this or why do you stare at us as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk,1,MRK.12
1488,MRK,12,NRSV,last of all the woman herself died,therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that after we have examined him i may have something to write for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him,1,MRK.12
1489,MRK,12,NRSV,in the resurrection whose wife will she be,they do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,1,MRK.12
1490,MRK,12,NRSV,for the seven had married her,so he consented and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present,1,MRK.12
1491,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them is not this the reason you are wrong that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,1,MRK.12
1492,MRK,12,NRSV,for when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself,1,MRK.12
1493,MRK,12,NRSV,and as for the dead being raised have you not read in the book of moses in the story about the bush how god said to him i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,i paul write this greeting with my own hand,1,MRK.12
1494,MRK,12,NRSV,he is god not of the dead but of the living you are quite wrong,greet one another with a holy kiss,1,MRK.12
1495,MRK,12,NRSV,one of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well he asked him which commandment is the first of all,neither was man created for the sake of woman but woman for the sake of man,1,MRK.12
1496,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength,king agrippa do you believe the prophets,1,MRK.12
1497,MRK,12,NRSV,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit,1,MRK.12
1498,MRK,12,NRSV,there is no other commandment greater than these,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,1,MRK.12
1499,MRK,12,NRSV,then the scribe said to him you are right teacher you have truly said that he is one and besides him there is no other and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneselfthis is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,he said to them it was because you were so hardhearted that moses allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so,1,MRK.12
1500,MRK,12,NRSV,when jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god,the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in turmoil asking who is this,1,MRK.12
1501,MRK,12,NRSV,after that no one dared to ask him any question,for what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life,1,MRK.12
1502,MRK,12,NRSV,while jesus was teaching in the temple he said how can the scribes say that the messiah is the son of david,i entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair,1,MRK.12
1503,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself by the holy spirit declared the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1,MRK.12
1504,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself calls him lord so how can he be his son,but of the son he says your throne o god is forever and ever and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom,1,MRK.12
1505,MRK,12,NRSV,and the large crowd was listening to him with delight,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,1,MRK.12
1506,MRK,12,NRSV,as he taught he said beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him,1,MRK.12
1507,MRK,12,NRSV,they will receive the greater condemnation,let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others,1,MRK.12
1508,MRK,12,NRSV,he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury,when they hand you over do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say for what you are to say will be given to you at that time for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you,1,MRK.12
1509,MRK,12,NRSV,many rich people put in large sums,those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of gods spirit for they are foolishness to them and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned,1,MRK.12
1510,MRK,12,NRSV,a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which are worth a penny,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss,1,MRK.12
1511,MRK,12,NRSV,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury,but the throne of god and of the lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads,1,MRK.12
1512,MRK,12,NRSV,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1,MRK.12
1675,MRK,16,NRSV,when the sabbath was over mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor,1,MRK.16
1676,MRK,16,NRSV,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone,1,MRK.16
1677,MRK,16,NRSV,they had been saying to one another who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb,can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another but a believer goes to court against a believer and before unbelievers at that,1,MRK.16
1678,MRK,16,NRSV,when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled back,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he says also in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek,1,MRK.16
1679,MRK,16,NRSV,as they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed,how can you say show us the father,1,MRK.16
1680,MRK,16,NRSV,but he said to them do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified,now we command you beloved in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us,1,MRK.16
1681,MRK,16,NRSV,he has been raised he is not here,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first,1,MRK.16
1682,MRK,16,NRSV,look there is the place they laid him,did we not take the same steps,1,MRK.16
1683,MRK,16,NRSV,but go tell his disciples and peter that he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him just as he told you,immediately they regained their sight and followed him,1,MRK.16
1684,MRK,16,NRSV,so they went out and fled from the tomb for terror and amazement had seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up,1,MRK.16
1685,MRK,16,NRSV,and all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around peter,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ,1,MRK.16
1686,MRK,16,NRSV,and afterward jesus himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation,after mocking him they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him,1,MRK.16
1687,MRK,16,NRSV,now after he rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons,and he said to me these are true words of god,1,MRK.16
1688,MRK,16,NRSV,she went out and told those who had been with him while they were mourning and weeping,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire,1,MRK.16
1689,MRK,16,NRSV,but when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they would not believe it,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy,1,MRK.16
1690,MRK,16,NRSV,after this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country,then he said to the disciple here is your mother,1,MRK.16
1691,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision,1,MRK.16
1692,MRK,16,NRSV,later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove,1,MRK.16
1693,MRK,16,NRSV,and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation,other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty,1,MRK.16
1694,MRK,16,NRSV,the one who believes and is baptized will be saved but the one who does not believe will be condemned,when peter said from others jesus said to him then the children are free,1,MRK.16
1695,MRK,16,NRSV,and these signs will accompany those who believe by using my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes in their hands and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name,1,MRK.16
1696,MRK,16,NRSV,so then the lord jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans,1,MRK.16
1697,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere while the lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,1,MRK.16
1768,LUK,2,NRSV,in those days a decree went out from emperor augustus that all the world should be registered,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints,1,LUK.2
1769,LUK,2,NRSV,this was the first registration and was taken while quirinius was governor of syria,he replied elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things but i tell you that elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but they did to him whatever they pleased,1,LUK.2
1770,LUK,2,NRSV,all went to their own towns to be registered,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father,1,LUK.2
1771,LUK,2,NRSV,joseph also went from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to the city of david called bethlehem because he was descended from the house and family of david,mary has chosen the better part which will not be taken away from her,1,LUK.2
1772,LUK,2,NRSV,he went to be registered with mary to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth,1,LUK.2
1773,LUK,2,NRSV,while they were there the time came for her to deliver her child,then peter came and said to him lord if another member of the church sins against me how often should i forgive,1,LUK.2
1774,LUK,2,NRSV,and she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1,LUK.2
1775,LUK,2,NRSV,in that region there were shepherds living in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night,our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen,1,LUK.2
1776,LUK,2,NRSV,then an angel of the lord stood before them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were terrified,jesus said to him again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test,1,LUK.2
1777,LUK,2,NRSV,but the angel said to them do not be afraid for seei am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people to you is born this day in the city of david a savior who is the messiah the lord,he entered his headquarters again and asked jesus where are you from,1,LUK.2
1778,LUK,2,NRSV,this will be a sign for you you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger,but even on this point their testimony did not agree,1,LUK.2
1779,LUK,2,NRSV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest heaven and on earth peace among those whom he favors when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another let us go now to bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place which the lord has made known to us,she will bear a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins,1,LUK.2
1780,LUK,2,NRSV,so they went with haste and found mary and joseph and the child lying in the manger,only let us hold fast to what we have attained,1,LUK.2
1781,LUK,2,NRSV,when they saw this they made known what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler and saul,1,LUK.2
1782,LUK,2,NRSV,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand,1,LUK.2
1783,LUK,2,NRSV,the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all they had heard and seen as it had been told them,the pharisees then said to one another you see you can do nothing,1,LUK.2
1784,LUK,2,NRSV,after eight days had passed it was time to circumcise the child and he was called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb,still i think it necessary to send to you epaphroditusmy brother and coworker and fellow soldier your messenger and minister to my need for he has been longing for all of you and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill,1,LUK.2
1785,LUK,2,NRSV,when the time came for their purification according to the law of moses they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the lord and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,now if i am in the wrong and have committed something for which i deserve to die i am not trying to escape death but if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can turn me over to them,1,LUK.2
1786,LUK,2,NRSV,now there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon this man was righteous and devout looking forward to the consolation of israel and the holy spirit rested on him,because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous,1,LUK.2
1787,LUK,2,NRSV,it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the lords messiah,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish just as they did,1,LUK.2
1788,LUK,2,NRSV,guided by the spirit simeon came into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what was customary under the law simeon took him in his arms and praised god saying master now you are dismissing your servant in peace according to your word for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people israel,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments,1,LUK.2
1789,LUK,2,NRSV,and the childs father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money,1,LUK.2
1790,LUK,2,NRSV,then simeon blessed them and said to his mother mary this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealedand a sword will pierce your own soul too,he ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics,1,LUK.2
1791,LUK,2,NRSV,there was also a prophet anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher,then i looked and i heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands singing with full voice worthy is the lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them singing to the one seated on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped,1,LUK.2
1792,LUK,2,NRSV,she was of a great age having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage then as a widow to the age of eightyfour,for this reason i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name,1,LUK.2
1793,LUK,2,NRSV,she never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them,1,LUK.2
1794,LUK,2,NRSV,at that moment she came and began to praise god and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of jerusalem,those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found both good and bad so the wedding hall was filled with guests,1,LUK.2
1795,LUK,2,NRSV,when they had finished everything required by the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,1,LUK.2
1796,LUK,2,NRSV,the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom and the favor of god was upon him,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,1,LUK.2
1797,LUK,2,NRSV,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name,1,LUK.2
1798,LUK,2,NRSV,and when he was twelve years old they went up as usual for the festival,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man,1,LUK.2
1799,LUK,2,NRSV,when the festival was ended and they started to return the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but his parents did not know it,after one day there a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to puteoli,1,LUK.2
1800,LUK,2,NRSV,assuming that he was in the group of travelers they went a days journey,but if you are led by the spirit you are not subject to the law,1,LUK.2
1801,LUK,2,NRSV,then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1,LUK.2
1802,LUK,2,NRSV,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him,go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice,1,LUK.2
1803,LUK,2,NRSV,after three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory,1,LUK.2
1804,LUK,2,NRSV,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter,1,LUK.2
1805,LUK,2,NRSV,when his parents saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him child why have you treated us like this,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1,LUK.2
1806,LUK,2,NRSV,look your father and i have been searching for you in great anxiety,now when the first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received the usual daily wage,1,LUK.2
1807,LUK,2,NRSV,he said to them why were you searching for me,and he answered them go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news brought to them,1,LUK.2
1808,LUK,2,NRSV,did you not know that i must be in my fathers house,and every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim jesus as the messiah,1,LUK.2
1809,LUK,2,NRSV,but they did not understand what he said to them,there are three that testify the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree,1,LUK.2
1810,LUK,2,NRSV,then he went down with them and came to nazareth and was obedient to them,you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour,1,LUK.2
1811,LUK,2,NRSV,his mother treasured all these things in her heart,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe,1,LUK.2
1812,LUK,2,NRSV,and jesus increased in wisdom and in years and in divine and human favor,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,1,LUK.2
1834,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness where for forty days he was tempted by the devil,and if the ear would say because i am not an eye i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body,1,LUK.4
1835,LUK,4,NRSV,he ate nothing at all during those days and when they were over he was famished,and again another passage of scripture says they will look on the one whom they have pierced,1,LUK.4
1836,LUK,4,NRSV,the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become a loaf of bread,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory,1,LUK.4
1837,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written one does not live by bread alone,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury,1,LUK.4
1838,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world,get up let us be going,1,LUK.4
1839,LUK,4,NRSV,and the devil said to him to you i will give their glory and all this authority for it has been given over to me and i give it to anyone i please,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband,1,LUK.4
1840,LUK,4,NRSV,if you then will worship me it will all be yours,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts,1,LUK.4
1841,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him,do you not remember that i told you these things when i was still with you,1,LUK.4
1842,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil took him to jerusalem and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down from here for it is written he will command his angels concerning you to protect you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone,the elder to the beloved gaius whom i love in truth,1,LUK.4
1843,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is said do not put the lord your god to the test,no one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs the soldiers aim is to please the enlisting officer,1,LUK.4
1844,LUK,4,NRSV,when the devil had finished every test he departed from him until an opportune time,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation,1,LUK.4
1845,LUK,4,NRSV,then jesus filled with the power of the spirit returned to galilee and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country,and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear,1,LUK.4
1846,LUK,4,NRSV,he began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,1,LUK.4
1847,LUK,4,NRSV,when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day as was his custom,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ,1,LUK.4
1848,LUK,4,NRSV,he stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him,such a person receives praise not from others but from god,1,LUK.4
1849,LUK,4,NRSV,he unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,1,LUK.4
1850,LUK,4,NRSV,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the lords favor,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1,LUK.4
1851,LUK,4,NRSV,and he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down,for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly provided for you,1,LUK.4
1852,LUK,4,NRSV,the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned,1,LUK.4
1853,LUK,4,NRSV,then he began to say to them today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet,1,LUK.4
1854,LUK,4,NRSV,all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour,1,LUK.4
1855,LUK,4,NRSV,they said is not this josephs son,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps,1,LUK.4
1856,LUK,4,NRSV,he said to them doubtless you will quote to me this proverb doctor cure yourself and you will say do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at capernaum,and to the angel of the church in thyatira write these are the words of the son of god who has eyes like a flame of fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze i know your worksyour love faith service and patient endurance,1,LUK.4
1857,LUK,4,NRSV,and he said truly i tell you no prophet is accepted in the prophets hometown,as for yourselves beware for they will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them,1,LUK.4
1858,LUK,4,NRSV,but the truth is there were many widows in israel in the time of elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months and there was a severe famine over all the land yet elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at zarephath in sidon,he will show you a large room upstairs already furnished,1,LUK.4
1859,LUK,4,NRSV,there were also many lepers in israel in the time of the prophet elisha and none of them was cleansed except naaman the syrian,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,1,LUK.4
1860,LUK,4,NRSV,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything,1,LUK.4
1861,LUK,4,NRSV,they got up drove him out of the town and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff,for the son of man is lord of the sabbath,1,LUK.4
1862,LUK,4,NRSV,but he passed through the midst of them and went on his way,how then does he now see,1,LUK.4
1863,LUK,4,NRSV,he went down to capernaum a city in galilee and was teaching them on the sabbath,so do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows,1,LUK.4
1864,LUK,4,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching because he spoke with authority,give to everyone who begs from you and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you,1,LUK.4
1865,LUK,4,NRSV,in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice let us alone what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed,1,LUK.4
1866,LUK,4,NRSV,have you come to destroy us,it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile they throw it away,1,LUK.4
1867,LUK,4,NRSV,i know who you are the holy one of god,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband is the head of his wife and god is the head of christ,1,LUK.4
1868,LUK,4,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead,1,LUK.4
1869,LUK,4,NRSV,they were all amazed and kept saying to one another what kind of utterance is this,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like,1,LUK.4
1870,LUK,4,NRSV,for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and out they come and a report about him began to reach every place in the region,blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god,1,LUK.4
1871,LUK,4,NRSV,after leaving the synagogue he entered simons house,i write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you,1,LUK.4
1872,LUK,4,NRSV,now simons motherinlaw was suffering from a high fever and they asked him about her,pay to all what is due themtaxes to whom taxes are due revenue to whom revenue is due respect to whom respect is due honor to whom honor is due,1,LUK.4
1873,LUK,4,NRSV,then he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her,but god raised him up having freed him from death because it was impossible for him to be held in its power,1,LUK.4
1874,LUK,4,NRSV,immediately she got up and began to serve them,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight,1,LUK.4
1875,LUK,4,NRSV,as the sun was setting all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them,and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine and the herd numbering about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea,1,LUK.4
1876,LUK,4,NRSV,demons also came out of many shouting you are the son of god but he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the messiah,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,1,LUK.4
1877,LUK,4,NRSV,at daybreak he departed and went into a deserted place,but i say to you that listen love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you,1,LUK.4
1878,LUK,4,NRSV,and the crowds were looking for him and when they reached him they wanted to prevent him from leaving them,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him,1,LUK.4
1879,LUK,4,NRSV,but he said to them i must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of god to the other cities also for i was sent for this purpose,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,1,LUK.4
1880,LUK,4,NRSV,so he continued proclaiming the message in the synagogues of judea,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,1,LUK.4
2097,LUK,9,NRSV,then jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal,so because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i am about to spit you out of my mouth,1,LUK.9
2098,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me,1,LUK.9
2099,LUK,9,NRSV,whatever house you enter stay there and leave from there,for this reason rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith not paying attention to jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth,1,LUK.9
2100,LUK,9,NRSV,wherever they do not welcome you as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them,that is not the way you learned christ for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus,1,LUK.9
2101,LUK,9,NRSV,they departed and went through the villages bringing the good news and curing diseases everywhere,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,1,LUK.9
2102,LUK,9,NRSV,now herod the ruler heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen,he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and bring simon who is called peter he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved,1,LUK.9
2103,LUK,9,NRSV,herod said john i beheaded but who is this about whom i hear such things,what then is to be done,1,LUK.9
2104,LUK,9,NRSV,and he tried to see him,these have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting selfimposed piety humility and severe treatment of the body but they are of no value in checking selfindulgence,1,LUK.9
2105,LUK,9,NRSV,on their return the apostles told jesus all they had done,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,1,LUK.9
2106,LUK,9,NRSV,he took them with him and withdrew privately to a city called bethsaida,all nations will come and worship before you for your judgments have been revealed,1,LUK.9
2107,LUK,9,NRSV,when the crowds found out about it they followed him and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and healed those who needed to be cured,while they were there the time came for her to deliver her child,1,LUK.9
2108,LUK,9,NRSV,the day was drawing to a close and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and get provisions for we are here in a deserted place,he saw the linen wrappings lying there and the cloth that had been on jesus head not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself,1,LUK.9
2109,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said to them you give them something to eat,because i do not love you,1,LUK.9
2110,LUK,9,NRSV,they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people,he said to them have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1,LUK.9
2111,LUK,9,NRSV,for there were about five thousand men,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet,1,LUK.9
2112,LUK,9,NRSV,and he said to his disciples make them sit down in groups of about fifty each,then they sent to him some pharisees and some herodians to trap him in what he said,1,LUK.9
2113,LUK,9,NRSV,they did so and made them all sit down,and just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed,1,LUK.9
2114,LUK,9,NRSV,and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them,1,LUK.9
2115,LUK,9,NRSV,and all ate and were filled,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done,1,LUK.9
2116,LUK,9,NRSV,what was left over was gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces,after this the lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go,1,LUK.9
2117,LUK,9,NRSV,once when jesus was praying alone with only the disciples near him he asked them who do the crowds say that i am,then jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart,1,LUK.9
2118,LUK,9,NRSV,they answered john the baptist but others elijah and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen,so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say,1,LUK.9
2119,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am,i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor,1,LUK.9
2120,LUK,9,NRSV,peter answered the messiah of god,welcome him then in the lord with all joy and honor such people because he came close to death for the work of christ risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me,1,LUK.9
2121,LUK,9,NRSV,he sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone saying the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised,some of them were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a great many of the devout greeks and not a few of the leading women,1,LUK.9
2122,LUK,9,NRSV,then he said to them all if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me,can a demon open the eyes of the blind,1,LUK.9
2123,LUK,9,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it,for whoever has died is freed from sin,1,LUK.9
2124,LUK,9,NRSV,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1,LUK.9
2125,LUK,9,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words of them the son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels,when elizabeth heard marys greeting the child leaped in her womb,1,LUK.9
2126,LUK,9,NRSV,but truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god,when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near,1,LUK.9
2127,LUK,9,NRSV,now about eight days after these sayings jesus took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray,this is the second death the lake of fire and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire,1,LUK.9
2128,LUK,9,NRSV,and while he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became dazzling white,so they are no longer two but one flesh,1,LUK.9
2129,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him,and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away,1,LUK.9
2130,LUK,9,NRSV,they appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem,for many live as enemies of the cross of christ i have often told you of them and now i tell you even with tears,1,LUK.9
2131,LUK,9,NRSV,now peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep but since they had stayed awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him,for his life is taken away from the earth,1,LUK.9
2132,LUK,9,NRSV,just as they were leaving him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijahnot knowing what he said,and the angel said to me write this blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb,1,LUK.9
2133,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were terrified as they entered the cloud,but solid food is for the mature for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil,1,LUK.9
2134,LUK,9,NRSV,then from the cloud came a voice that said this is my son my chosen listen to him when the voice had spoken jesus was found alone,the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord,1,LUK.9
2135,LUK,9,NRSV,and they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me,1,LUK.9
2136,LUK,9,NRSV,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him,but he turned and rebuked them,1,LUK.9
2137,LUK,9,NRSV,just then a man from the crowd shouted teacher i beg you to look at my son he is my only child,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him,1,LUK.9
2138,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly a spirit seizes him and all at once he shrieks,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child,1,LUK.9
2139,LUK,9,NRSV,it convulses him until he foams at the mouth it mauls him and will scarcely leave him,draw near to god and he will draw near to you,1,LUK.9
2140,LUK,9,NRSV,i begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not,from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force,1,LUK.9
2141,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you and bear with you,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death,1,LUK.9
2142,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was coming the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions,indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel,1,LUK.9
2143,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father,zacchaeus stood there and said to the lord look half of my possessions lord i will give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i will pay back four times as much,1,LUK.9
2144,LUK,9,NRSV,and all were astounded at the greatness of god,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born,1,LUK.9
2145,LUK,9,NRSV,while everyone was amazed at all that he was doing he said to his disciples let these words sink into your ears the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ,1,LUK.9
2146,LUK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand this saying its meaning was concealed from them so that they could not perceive it,do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god,1,LUK.9
2147,LUK,9,NRSV,and they were afraid to ask him about this saying,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well,1,LUK.9
2148,LUK,9,NRSV,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest,jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in hebrew rabbouni which means teacher,1,LUK.9
2149,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus aware of their inner thoughts took a little child and put it by his side and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for the least among all of you is the greatest,but now because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time you will become mute unable to speak until the day these things occur,1,LUK.9
2150,LUK,9,NRSV,john answered master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles away and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother,1,LUK.9
2151,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him do not stop him for whoever is not against you is for you,he will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1,LUK.9
2152,LUK,9,NRSV,when the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to jerusalem,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury,1,LUK.9
2153,LUK,9,NRSV,and he sent messengers ahead of him,but even if i am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me,1,LUK.9
2154,LUK,9,NRSV,on their way they entered a village of the samaritans to make ready for him but they did not receive him because his face was set toward jerusalem,early in the morning he came again to the temple,1,LUK.9
2155,LUK,9,NRSV,when his disciples james and john saw it they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them,john testified to him and cried out this was he of whom i said he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me,1,LUK.9
2156,LUK,9,NRSV,but he turned and rebuked them,and he went out into the forecourt,1,LUK.9
2157,LUK,9,NRSV,then they went on to another village,we know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another,1,LUK.9
2158,LUK,9,NRSV,as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin,1,LUK.9
2159,LUK,9,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head,do not fear what you are about to suffer,1,LUK.9
2160,LUK,9,NRSV,to another he said follow me,jews do not share things in common with samaritans jesus answered her if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water,1,LUK.9
2161,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said lord first let me go and bury my father,also he said write this for these words are trustworthy and true,1,LUK.9
2162,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him let the dead bury their own dead but as for you go and proclaim the kingdom of god,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1,LUK.9
2163,LUK,9,NRSV,another said i will follow you lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home,when they had washed her they laid her in a room upstairs,1,LUK.9
2164,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of god,when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey and all of them with wives and children escorted us outside the city,1,LUK.9
2315,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very time there were some present who told him about the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices,when those hired about five oclock came each of them received the usual daily wage,1,LUK.13
2316,LUK,13,NRSV,he asked them do you think that because these galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other galileans,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away,1,LUK.13
2317,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus,1,LUK.13
2318,LUK,13,NRSV,or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of siloam fell on themdo you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in jerusalem,they count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime,1,LUK.13
2319,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish just as they did,or what is the value of circumcision,1,LUK.13
2320,LUK,13,NRSV,then he told this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and found none,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,1,LUK.13
2321,LUK,13,NRSV,so he said to the gardener see here for three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and still i find none,i know a person in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heavenwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows,1,LUK.13
2322,LUK,13,NRSV,cut it down why should it be wasting the soil,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table,1,LUK.13
2323,LUK,13,NRSV,he replied sir let it alone for one more year until i dig around it and put manure on it,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness,1,LUK.13
2324,LUK,13,NRSV,if it bears fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1,LUK.13
2325,LUK,13,NRSV,now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,1,LUK.13
2326,LUK,13,NRSV,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years,and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,1,LUK.13
2327,LUK,13,NRSV,she was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight,then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his messiah and he will reign forever and ever,1,LUK.13
2328,LUK,13,NRSV,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment,they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it,1,LUK.13
2329,LUK,13,NRSV,when he laid his hands on her immediately she stood up straight and began praising god,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,1,LUK.13
2330,LUK,13,NRSV,but the leader of the synagogue indignant because jesus had cured on the sabbath kept saying to the crowd there are six days on which work ought to be done come on those days and be cured and not on the sabbath day,they were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes,1,LUK.13
2331,LUK,13,NRSV,but the lord answered him and said you hypocrites does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh,1,LUK.13
2332,LUK,13,NRSV,and ought not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage,1,LUK.13
2333,LUK,13,NRSV,when he said this all his opponents were put to shame and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day,1,LUK.13
2334,LUK,13,NRSV,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm,1,LUK.13
2335,LUK,13,NRSV,and to what should i compare it,so they answered that they did not know where it came from,1,LUK.13
2336,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made nests in its branches,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,1,LUK.13
2337,LUK,13,NRSV,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god,and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink,1,LUK.13
2338,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body,1,LUK.13
2339,LUK,13,NRSV,jesus went through one town and village after another teaching as he made his way to jerusalem,very truly i tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice you will have pain but your pain will turn into joy,1,LUK.13
2340,LUK,13,NRSV,someone asked him lord will only a few be saved,where a will is involved the death of the one who made it must be established,1,LUK.13
2341,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them strive to enter through the narrow door for many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants the prophets,1,LUK.13
2342,LUK,13,NRSV,when once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying lord open to us then in reply he will say to you i do not know where you come from,you brood of vipers how can you speak good things when you are evil,1,LUK.13
2343,LUK,13,NRSV,then you will begin to say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets,so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do everything for the glory of god,1,LUK.13
2344,LUK,13,NRSV,but he will say i do not know where you come from go away from me all you evildoers there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrown out,paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and our brother sosthenes to the church of god that is in corinth to those who are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our lord jesus christ both their lord and ours grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1,LUK.13
2345,LUK,13,NRSV,then people will come from east and west from north and south and will eat in the kingdom of god,if you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin you will ask and god will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal,1,LUK.13
2346,LUK,13,NRSV,indeed some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last,thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets,1,LUK.13
2347,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very hour some pharisees came and said to him get away from here for herod wants to kill you,then i saw the lamb open one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures call out as with a voice of thunder come i looked and there was a white horse its rider had a bow a crown was given to him and he came out conquering and to conquer,1,LUK.13
2348,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them go and tell that fox for me listen i am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow and on the third day i finish my work,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat,1,LUK.13
2349,LUK,13,NRSV,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin,1,LUK.13
2350,LUK,13,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing see your house is left to you,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father,1,LUK.13
2351,LUK,13,NRSV,and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord,a certain young man was following him wearing nothing but a linen cloth,1,LUK.13
2483,LUK,18,NRSV,then jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment,1,LUK.18
2484,LUK,18,NRSV,he said in a certain city there was a judge who neither feared god nor had respect for people,then he shouted jesus son of david have mercy on me those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet but he shouted even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him and when he came near he asked him what do you want me to do for you,1,LUK.18
2485,LUK,18,NRSV,in that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying grant me justice against my opponent,but thomas who was called the twin one of the twelve was not with them when jesus came,1,LUK.18
2486,LUK,18,NRSV,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming,there were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting,1,LUK.18
2487,LUK,18,NRSV,and the lord said listen to what the unjust judge says,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god,1,LUK.18
2488,LUK,18,NRSV,and will not god grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night,did i take advantage of you through any of those whom i sent to you,1,LUK.18
2489,LUK,18,NRSV,will he delay long in helping them,but to which of the angels has he ever said sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet,1,LUK.18
2490,LUK,18,NRSV,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them,and he invited philip to get in and sit beside him,1,LUK.18
2491,LUK,18,NRSV,and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified,1,LUK.18
2492,LUK,18,NRSV,he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector,as for titus he is my partner and coworker in your service as for our brothers they are messengers of the churches the glory of christ,1,LUK.18
2493,LUK,18,NRSV,the pharisee standing by himself was praying thus god i thank you that i am not like other people thieves rogues adulterers or even like this tax collector,then festus gave the order and paul was brought in,1,LUK.18
2494,LUK,18,NRSV,i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing,1,LUK.18
2495,LUK,18,NRSV,but the tax collector standing far off would not even look up to heaven but was beating his breast and saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his home justified rather than the other for all who exalt themselves will be humbled but all who humble themselves will be exalted,a man was there named zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was rich,1,LUK.18
2496,LUK,18,NRSV,people were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them and when the disciples saw it they sternly ordered them not to do it,avoid them for among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth,1,LUK.18
2497,LUK,18,NRSV,but jesus called for them and said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,1,LUK.18
2498,LUK,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,when we cry abba father it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him,1,LUK.18
2499,LUK,18,NRSV,a certain ruler asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life,then some people came bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four of them,1,LUK.18
2500,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good,the jailer called for lights and rushing in he fell down trembling before paul and silas,1,LUK.18
2501,LUK,18,NRSV,no one is good but god alone,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,1,LUK.18
2502,LUK,18,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother,the faith that you have have as your own conviction before god,1,LUK.18
2503,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied i have kept all these since my youth,it is even more obvious when another priest arises resembling melchizedek one who has become a priest not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life,1,LUK.18
2504,LUK,18,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to him there is still one thing lacking,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives,1,LUK.18
2505,LUK,18,NRSV,sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me,rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you,1,LUK.18
2506,LUK,18,NRSV,but when he heard this he became sad for he was very rich,very truly i tell you anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit,1,LUK.18
2507,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children,1,LUK.18
2508,LUK,18,NRSV,those who heard it said then who can be saved,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him,1,LUK.18
2509,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied what is impossible for mortals is possible for god,if this man were not from god he could do nothing,1,LUK.18
2510,LUK,18,NRSV,then peter said look we have left our homes and followed you,and he took them up in his arms laid his hands on them and blessed them,1,LUK.18
2511,LUK,18,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god who will not get back very much more in this age and in the age to come eternal life,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,1,LUK.18
2512,LUK,18,NRSV,then he took the twelve aside and said to them see we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written about the son of man by the prophets will be accomplished,but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk,1,LUK.18
2513,LUK,18,NRSV,for he will be handed over to the gentiles and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon,when they heard this they were enraged and shouted great is artemis of the ephesians the city was filled with the confusion and people rushed together to the theater dragging with them gaius and aristarchus macedonians who were pauls travel companions,1,LUK.18
2514,LUK,18,NRSV,after they have flogged him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables,1,LUK.18
2515,LUK,18,NRSV,but they understood nothing about all these things in fact what he said was hidden from them and they did not grasp what was said,but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me also so that i would not have one sorrow after another,1,LUK.18
2516,LUK,18,NRSV,as he approached jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging,they should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them anointing them with oil in the name of the lord,1,LUK.18
2517,LUK,18,NRSV,when he heard a crowd going by he asked what was happening,by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin,1,LUK.18
2518,LUK,18,NRSV,they told him jesus of nazareth is passing by,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,1,LUK.18
2519,LUK,18,NRSV,then he shouted jesus son of david have mercy on me those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet but he shouted even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him and when he came near he asked him what do you want me to do for you,woe to you when all speak well of you for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets,1,LUK.18
2520,LUK,18,NRSV,he said lord let me see again,for a bishop as gods steward must be blameless he must not be arrogant or quicktempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain but he must be hospitable a lover of goodness prudent upright devout and selfcontrolled,1,LUK.18
2521,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has saved you,yet those who marry will experience distress in this life and i would spare you that,1,LUK.18
2522,LUK,18,NRSV,immediately he regained his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it praised god,one day while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting near by they had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal,1,LUK.18
2759,LUK,24,NRSV,but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb taking the spices that they had prepared,but if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not be boastful and false to the truth,1,LUK.24
2760,LUK,24,NRSV,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him,1,LUK.24
2761,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were perplexed about this suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it,1,LUK.24
2762,LUK,24,NRSV,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead,i will make those of the synagogue of satan who say that they are jews and are not but are lyingi will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that i have loved you,1,LUK.24
2763,LUK,24,NRSV,he is not here but has risen,but a second time the voice answered from heaven what god has made clean you must not call profane,1,LUK.24
2764,LUK,24,NRSV,remember how he told you while he was still in galilee that the son of man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified and on the third day rise again,but jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but for god all things are possible,1,LUK.24
2765,LUK,24,NRSV,then they remembered his words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest,when they had come near jerusalem and had reached bethphage at the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples saying to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me,1,LUK.24
2766,LUK,24,NRSV,now it was mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the other women with them who told this to the apostles,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him,1,LUK.24
2767,LUK,24,NRSV,but these words seemed to them an idle tale and they did not believe them,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon,1,LUK.24
2768,LUK,24,NRSV,but peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves then he went home amazed at what had happened,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water,1,LUK.24
2769,LUK,24,NRSV,now on that same day two of them were going to a village called emmaus about seven miles from jerusalem and talking with each other about all these things that had happened,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1,LUK.24
2770,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy,1,LUK.24
2771,LUK,24,NRSV,and he said to them what are you discussing with each other while you walk along,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals,1,LUK.24
2772,LUK,24,NRSV,then one of them whose name was cleopas answered him are you the only stranger in jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,1,LUK.24
2773,LUK,24,NRSV,they replied the things about jesus of nazareth who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him,he approached jesus to kiss him but jesus said to him judas is it with a kiss that you are betraying the son of man,1,LUK.24
2774,LUK,24,NRSV,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel,you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers by relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death,1,LUK.24
2775,LUK,24,NRSV,yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things took place,and i saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened,1,LUK.24
2776,LUK,24,NRSV,moreover some women of our group astounded us,some of the pharisees near him heard this and said to him surely we are not blind are we,1,LUK.24
2777,LUK,24,NRSV,they were at the tomb early this morning and when they did not find his body there they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,1,LUK.24
2778,LUK,24,NRSV,some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,1,LUK.24
2779,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them oh how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared was it not necessary that the messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory,for such boasters are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ,1,LUK.24
2780,LUK,24,NRSV,then beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures,where o death is your sting,1,LUK.24
2781,LUK,24,NRSV,as they came near the village to which they were going he walked ahead as if he were going on,then they led him away to crucify him,1,LUK.24
2782,LUK,24,NRSV,but they urged him strongly saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over,joseph also went from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to the city of david called bethlehem because he was descended from the house and family of david,1,LUK.24
2783,LUK,24,NRSV,so he went in to stay with them,so jesus asked the twelve do you also wish to go away,1,LUK.24
2784,LUK,24,NRSV,when he was at the table with them he took bread blessed and broke it and gave it to them,they seized him shouting fellow israelites help this is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people our law and this place more than that he has actually brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place,1,LUK.24
2785,LUK,24,NRSV,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this,1,LUK.24
2786,LUK,24,NRSV,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him,1,LUK.24
2787,LUK,24,NRSV,that same hour they got up and returned to jerusalem and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on,1,LUK.24
2788,LUK,24,NRSV,they were saying the lord has risen indeed and he has appeared to simon then they told what had happened on the road and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread,then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1,LUK.24
2789,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you,i told them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge,1,LUK.24
2790,LUK,24,NRSV,they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you,1,LUK.24
2791,LUK,24,NRSV,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts,the works that i do in my fathers name testify to me but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep,1,LUK.24
2792,LUK,24,NRSV,look at my hands and my feet see that it is i myself,as it is written he scatters abroad he gives to the poor his righteousness endures forever,1,LUK.24
2793,LUK,24,NRSV,touch me and see for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,1,LUK.24
2794,LUK,24,NRSV,and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses,1,LUK.24
2795,LUK,24,NRSV,while in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering he said to them have you anything here to eat,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy,1,LUK.24
2796,LUK,24,NRSV,they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate in their presence,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword,1,LUK.24
2797,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with youthat everything written about me in the law of moses the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled,i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind just as the testimony of christ has been strengthened among you so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ,1,LUK.24
2798,LUK,24,NRSV,then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures and he said to them thus it is written that the messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations beginning from jerusalem,jesus heard that they had driven him out and when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man,1,LUK.24
2799,LUK,24,NRSV,you are witnesses of these things,this was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet isaiah lord who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed,1,LUK.24
2800,LUK,24,NRSV,and see i am sending upon you what my father promised so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high,they were in fact planning an ambush to kill him along the way,1,LUK.24
2801,LUK,24,NRSV,then he led them out as far as bethany and lifting up his hands he blessed them,he was in the world and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know him,1,LUK.24
2802,LUK,24,NRSV,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven,or are you the only ones it has reached anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must acknowledge that what i am writing to you is a command of the lord,1,LUK.24
2803,LUK,24,NRSV,and they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and they were continually in the temple blessing god,and when they had taken their places and were eating jesus said truly i tell you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me,1,LUK.24
2860,JHN,2,NRSV,on the third day there was a wedding in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there,from now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing,1,JHN.2
2861,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding,as i looked at it closely i saw fourfooted animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air,1,JHN.2
2862,JHN,2,NRSV,when the wine gave out the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine,and the man sprang up and began to walk,1,JHN.2
2863,JHN,2,NRSV,and jesus said to her woman what concern is that to you and to me,so they answered jesus we do not know,1,JHN.2
2864,JHN,2,NRSV,my hour has not yet come,you have done me no wrong,1,JHN.2
2865,JHN,2,NRSV,his mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god,1,JHN.2
2866,JHN,2,NRSV,now standing there were six stone water jars for the jewish rites of purification each holding twenty or thirty gallons,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night,1,JHN.2
2867,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus said to them fill the jars with water,therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals new moons or sabbaths,1,JHN.2
2868,JHN,2,NRSV,and they filled them up to the brim,the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective,1,JHN.2
2869,JHN,2,NRSV,he said to them now draw some out and take it to the chief steward,then each one will receive commendation from god,1,JHN.2
2870,JHN,2,NRSV,when the steward tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it came from though the servants who had drawn the water knew the steward called the bridegroom and said to him everyone serves the good wine first and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk,but jesus said let her alone why do you trouble her,1,JHN.2
2871,JHN,2,NRSV,but you have kept the good wine until now,besides all this between you and us a great chasm has been fixed so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so and no one can cross from there to us,1,JHN.2
2872,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food,1,JHN.2
2873,JHN,2,NRSV,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days,when they came to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him and said lord have mercy on my son for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly he often falls into the fire and often into the water,1,JHN.2
2874,JHN,2,NRSV,the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1,JHN.2
2875,JHN,2,NRSV,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1,JHN.2
2876,JHN,2,NRSV,making a whip of cords he drove all of them out of the temple both the sheep and the cattle,people will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations,1,JHN.2
2877,JHN,2,NRSV,he also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables,then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying with such violence babylon the great city will be thrown down and will be found no more and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters will be heard in you no more and an artisan of any trade will be found in you no more and the sound of the millstone will be heard in you no more and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more for your merchants were the magnates of the earth and all nations were deceived by your sorcery,1,JHN.2
2878,JHN,2,NRSV,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy,1,JHN.2
2879,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations,1,JHN.2
2880,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus answered them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,1,JHN.2
2881,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said this temple has been under construction for fortysix years and will you raise it up in three days,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on,1,JHN.2
2882,JHN,2,NRSV,but he was speaking of the temple of his body,do you have eyes and fail to see,1,JHN.2
2883,JHN,2,NRSV,after he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word that jesus had spoken,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son,1,JHN.2
2884,JHN,2,NRSV,when he was in jerusalem during the passover festival many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing,they said to her woman why are you weeping,1,JHN.2
2885,JHN,2,NRSV,but jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to testify about anyone for he himself knew what was in everyone,surely from now on all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me and holy is his name,1,JHN.2
3111,JHN,7,NRSV,after this jesus went about in galilee,and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good,1,JHN.7
3112,JHN,7,NRSV,he did not wish to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him,all who saw it began to grumble and said he has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner,1,JHN.7
3113,JHN,7,NRSV,now the jewish festival of booths was near,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine,1,JHN.7
3114,JHN,7,NRSV,so his brothers said to him leave here and go to judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret,then isaiah is so bold as to say i have been found by those who did not seek me i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me,1,JHN.7
3115,JHN,7,NRSV,if you do these things show yourself to the world,beloved we are gods children now what we will be has not yet been revealed,1,JHN.7
3116,JHN,7,NRSV,for not even his brothers believed in him jesus said to them my time has not yet come but your time is always here,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am,1,JHN.7
3117,JHN,7,NRSV,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil,for david says concerning him i saw the lord always before me for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced moreover my flesh will live in hope,1,JHN.7
3118,JHN,7,NRSV,i am not going to this festival for my time has not yet fully come,once while jesus was standing beside the lake of gennesaret and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of god he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets,1,JHN.7
3119,JHN,7,NRSV,after saying this he remained in galilee,but they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people,1,JHN.7
3120,JHN,7,NRSV,but after his brothers had gone to the festival then he also went not publicly but as it were in secret,how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt,1,JHN.7
3121,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were looking for him at the festival and saying where is he,they replied no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit,1,JHN.7
3122,JHN,7,NRSV,and there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power,1,JHN.7
3123,JHN,7,NRSV,while some were saying he is a good man others were saying no he is deceiving the crowd,they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor and saying that he himself is the messiah a king,1,JHN.7
3124,JHN,7,NRSV,yet no one would speak openly about him for fear of the jews,do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world,1,JHN.7
3125,JHN,7,NRSV,about the middle of the festival jesus went up into the temple and began to teach,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret,1,JHN.7
3126,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught,and simon and his companions hunted for him,1,JHN.7
3127,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1,JHN.7
3128,JHN,7,NRSV,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,1,JHN.7
3129,JHN,7,NRSV,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him,he answered let us go on to the neighboring towns so that i may proclaim the message there also for that is what i came out to do,1,JHN.7
3130,JHN,7,NRSV,did not moses give you the law,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days,1,JHN.7
3131,JHN,7,NRSV,yet none of you keeps the law,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,1,JHN.7
3132,JHN,7,NRSV,why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me,let anyone with ears listen the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field,1,JHN.7
3133,JHN,7,NRSV,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you,i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them,1,JHN.7
3134,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus answered them i performed one work and all of you are astonished,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them,1,JHN.7
3135,JHN,7,NRSV,moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him,1,JHN.7
3136,JHN,7,NRSV,if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of moses may not be broken are you angry with me because i healed a mans whole body on the sabbath,although i am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to me to bring to the gentiles the news of the boundless riches of christ and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in god who created all things so that through the church the wisdom of god in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places,1,JHN.7
3137,JHN,7,NRSV,do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment,when the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was astonished at the teaching about the lord,1,JHN.7
3138,JHN,7,NRSV,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,1,JHN.7
3139,JHN,7,NRSV,and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are,1,JHN.7
3140,JHN,7,NRSV,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them,1,JHN.7
3141,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication,1,JHN.7
3142,JHN,7,NRSV,i have not come on my own,now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching himthat she is a sinner,1,JHN.7
3143,JHN,7,NRSV,but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him,for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in gods sight but the doers of the law who will be justified,1,JHN.7
3144,JHN,7,NRSV,i know him because i am from him and he sent me,then peter and john laid their hands on them and they received the holy spirit,1,JHN.7
3145,JHN,7,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him but no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,1,JHN.7
3146,JHN,7,NRSV,yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying when the messiah comes will he do more signs than this man has done,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,1,JHN.7
3147,JHN,7,NRSV,the pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him and the chief priests and pharisees sent temple police to arrest him,when a strong man fully armed guards his castle his property is safe,1,JHN.7
3148,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me,he took her by the hand and said to her talitha cum which means little girl get up and immediately the girl got up and began to walk about she was twelve years of age,1,JHN.7
3149,JHN,7,NRSV,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,1,JHN.7
3150,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we will not find him,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good,1,JHN.7
3151,JHN,7,NRSV,does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks,immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring johns head,1,JHN.7
3152,JHN,7,NRSV,what does he mean by saying you will search for me and you will not find me and where i am you cannot come,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom i am the foremost,1,JHN.7
3153,JHN,7,NRSV,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink,but the residents of the city were divided some sided with the jews and some with the apostles,1,JHN.7
3154,JHN,7,NRSV,as the scripture has said out of the believers heart shall flow rivers of living water,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment,1,JHN.7
3155,JHN,7,NRSV,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus was not yet glorified,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat,1,JHN.7
3156,JHN,7,NRSV,when they heard these words some in the crowd said this is really the prophet,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1,JHN.7
3157,JHN,7,NRSV,others said this is the messiah,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish,1,JHN.7
3158,JHN,7,NRSV,but some asked surely the messiah does not come from galilee does he,but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him,1,JHN.7
3159,JHN,7,NRSV,has not the scripture said that the messiah is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived,they said lord look here are two swords,1,JHN.7
3160,JHN,7,NRSV,so there was a division in the crowd because of him,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory,1,JHN.7
3161,JHN,7,NRSV,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption,1,JHN.7
3162,JHN,7,NRSV,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him,do not be deceived fornicators idolaters adulterers male prostitutes sodomites thieves the greedy drunkards revilers robbersnone of these will inherit the kingdom of god,1,JHN.7
3163,JHN,7,NRSV,the police answered never has anyone spoken like this then the pharisees replied surely you have not been deceived too have you,he had still one other a beloved son,1,JHN.7
3164,JHN,7,NRSV,has any one of the authorities or of the pharisees believed in him,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,1,JHN.7
3165,JHN,7,NRSV,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god,1,JHN.7
3166,JHN,7,NRSV,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it,we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness,1,JHN.7
3167,JHN,7,NRSV,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping,1,JHN.7
3168,JHN,7,NRSV,search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from galilee,he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy according to the promise he made to our ancestors to abraham and to his descendants forever,1,JHN.7
3169,JHN,7,NRSV, then each of them went home,for i tell you this scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was counted among the lawless and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled,1,JHN.7
3170,JHN,8,NRSV,while jesus went to the mount of olives,the crowd that followed kept shouting away with him just as paul was about to be brought into the barracks he said to the tribune may i say something to you,1,JHN.8
3171,JHN,8,NRSV,early in the morning he came again to the temple,i tell you i will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,1,JHN.8
3172,JHN,8,NRSV,all the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them,she went out and told those who had been with him while they were mourning and weeping,1,JHN.8
3173,JHN,8,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and making her stand before all of them they said to him teacher this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery,but you are the same and your years will never end,1,JHN.8
3174,JHN,8,NRSV,now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him,1,JHN.8
3175,JHN,8,NRSV,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent,1,JHN.8
3176,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground,so they remained for a long time speaking boldly for the lord who testified to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through them,1,JHN.8
3177,JHN,8,NRSV,when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,then the pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight,1,JHN.8
3178,JHN,8,NRSV,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground,to the present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless and we grow weary from the work of our own hands,1,JHN.8
3179,JHN,8,NRSV,when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the elders and jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him,will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,1,JHN.8
3180,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus straightened up and said to her woman where are they,and on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down,1,JHN.8
3181,JHN,8,NRSV,and jesus said neither do i condemn you,when the accusers stood up they did not charge him with any of the crimes that i was expecting,1,JHN.8
3182,JHN,8,NRSV,go your way and from now on do not sin again again jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of the world,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive,1,JHN.8
3183,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,1,JHN.8
3184,JHN,8,NRSV,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right,1,JHN.8
3185,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid because i know where i have come from and where i am going but you do not know where i come from or where i am going,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day,1,JHN.8
3186,JHN,8,NRSV,you judge by human standards i judge no one,therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory,1,JHN.8
3187,JHN,8,NRSV,yet even if i do judge my judgment is valid for it is not i alone who judge but i and the father who sent me,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth,1,JHN.8
3188,JHN,8,NRSV,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father,1,JHN.8
3189,JHN,8,NRSV,i testify on my own behalf and the father who sent me testifies on my behalf,but the angel said to me why are you so amazed,1,JHN.8
3190,JHN,8,NRSV,then they said to him where is your father,yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies,1,JHN.8
3191,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered you know neither me nor my father,then he said are you also still without understanding,1,JHN.8
3192,JHN,8,NRSV,if you knew me you would know my father also,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace,1,JHN.8
3193,JHN,8,NRSV,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ,1,JHN.8
3194,JHN,8,NRSV,again he said to them i am going away and you will search for me but you will die in your sin,has not god chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him,1,JHN.8
3195,JHN,8,NRSV,where i am going you cannot come,and the disciples asked him why then do the scribes say that elijah must come first,1,JHN.8
3196,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said is he going to kill himself,there was also a prophet anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher,1,JHN.8
3197,JHN,8,NRSV,is that what he means by saying where i am going you cannot come,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,1,JHN.8
3198,JHN,8,NRSV,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world,i am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted,1,JHN.8
3199,JHN,8,NRSV,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me,1,JHN.8
3200,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him who are you,so throwing off his cloak he sprang up and came to jesus,1,JHN.8
3201,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table,1,JHN.8
3202,JHN,8,NRSV,i have much to say about you and much to condemn but the one who sent me is true and i declare to the world what i have heard from him,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again,1,JHN.8
3203,JHN,8,NRSV,they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth,1,JHN.8
3204,JHN,8,NRSV,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me,they are upsetting the faith of some,1,JHN.8
3205,JHN,8,NRSV,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him,he said i am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as the prophet isaiah said,1,JHN.8
3206,JHN,8,NRSV,as he was saying these things many believed in him,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1,JHN.8
3207,JHN,8,NRSV,then jesus said to the jews who had believed in him if you continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free,when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him,1,JHN.8
3208,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves to anyone,for out of the heart come evil intentions murder adultery fornication theft false witness slander,1,JHN.8
3209,JHN,8,NRSV,what do you mean by saying you will be made free,the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born,1,JHN.8
3210,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin,soon afterwards he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him,1,JHN.8
3211,JHN,8,NRSV,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever,the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life,1,JHN.8
3212,JHN,8,NRSV,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed,then jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god and the disciples were perplexed at these words,1,JHN.8
3213,JHN,8,NRSV,i know that you are descendants of abraham yet you look for an opportunity to kill me because there is no place in you for my word,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you,1,JHN.8
3214,JHN,8,NRSV,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father,then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventyfive in all so jacob went down to egypt,1,JHN.8
3215,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him abraham is our father,an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah,1,JHN.8
3216,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing what abraham did but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods,1,JHN.8
3217,JHN,8,NRSV,this is not what abraham did,should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute,1,JHN.8
3218,JHN,8,NRSV,you are indeed doing what your father does,after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem,1,JHN.8
3219,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,they said to him we will go with you,1,JHN.8
3220,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here,and just as it is appointed for mortals to die once and after that the judgment so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him,1,JHN.8
3221,JHN,8,NRSV,i did not come on my own but he sent me,resist the devil and he will flee from you,1,JHN.8
3222,JHN,8,NRSV,why do you not understand what i say,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart,1,JHN.8
3223,JHN,8,NRSV,it is because you cannot accept my word,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him,1,JHN.8
3224,JHN,8,NRSV,you are from your father the devil and you choose to do your fathers desires,and they said jesus of nazareth,1,JHN.8
3225,JHN,8,NRSV,he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,the angel said to him fasten your belt and put on your sandals,1,JHN.8
3226,JHN,8,NRSV,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us,1,JHN.8
3227,JHN,8,NRSV,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water,1,JHN.8
3228,JHN,8,NRSV,which of you convicts me of sin,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place,1,JHN.8
3229,JHN,8,NRSV,if i tell the truth why do you not believe me,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel,1,JHN.8
3230,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever is from god hears the words of god,but what is the divine reply to him,1,JHN.8
3231,JHN,8,NRSV,the reason you do not hear them is that you are not from god,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you,1,JHN.8
3232,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,and all the people who heard this including the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of god because they had been baptized with johns baptism,1,JHN.8
3233,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me,do you wish to have no fear of the authority,1,JHN.8
3234,JHN,8,NRSV,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,i will rescue you from your people and from the gentilesto whom i am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me,1,JHN.8
3235,JHN,8,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever keeps my word will never see death,our ancestors in turn brought it in with joshua when they dispossessed the nations that god drove out before our ancestors,1,JHN.8
3236,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,1,JHN.8
3237,JHN,8,NRSV,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god,1,JHN.8
3238,JHN,8,NRSV,are you greater than our father abraham who died,in that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying grant me justice against my opponent,1,JHN.8
3239,JHN,8,NRSV,who do you claim to be,the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a violent earthquake such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth so violent was that earthquake,1,JHN.8
3240,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing,erastus remained in corinth trophimus i left ill in miletus,1,JHN.8
3241,JHN,8,NRSV,it is my father who glorifies me he of whom you say he is our god though you do not know him,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,1,JHN.8
3242,JHN,8,NRSV,but i know him if i would say that i do not know him i would be a liar like you,but about that day or hour no one knows neither the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father,1,JHN.8
3243,JHN,8,NRSV,but i do know him and i keep his word,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth,1,JHN.8
3244,JHN,8,NRSV,your ancestor abraham rejoiced that he would see my day he saw it and was glad,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months,1,JHN.8
3245,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham,then he said to them you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition for moses said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die,1,JHN.8
3246,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you before abraham was i am,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things,1,JHN.8
3247,JHN,8,NRSV,so they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple,not that anyone has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father,1,JHN.8
3354,JHN,11,NRSV,now a certain man was ill lazarus of bethany the village of mary and her sister martha,god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them,1,JHN.11
3355,JHN,11,NRSV,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,1,JHN.11
3356,JHN,11,NRSV,so the sisters sent a message to jesus lord he whom you love is ill,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law,1,JHN.11
3357,JHN,11,NRSV,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it,timothy my coworker greets you so do lucius and jason and sosipater my relatives,1,JHN.11
3358,JHN,11,NRSV,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,when he opened the sixth seal i looked and there came a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale,1,JHN.11
3359,JHN,11,NRSV,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself,1,JHN.11
3360,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him rabbi the jews were just now trying to stone you and are you going there again,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it,1,JHN.11
3361,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight,the disciples went and did as jesus had directed them they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and he sat on them,1,JHN.11
3362,JHN,11,NRSV,those who walk during the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct,1,JHN.11
3363,JHN,11,NRSV,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness,1,JHN.11
3364,JHN,11,NRSV,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him,if anyone strikes you on the cheek offer the other also and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt,1,JHN.11
3365,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right,for this reason they are before the throne of god and worship him day and night within his temple and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them,1,JHN.11
3366,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus however had been speaking about his death but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep,for you may give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up,1,JHN.11
3367,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus told them plainly lazarus is dead,and at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each,1,JHN.11
3368,JHN,11,NRSV,for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe,then after completing their mission barnabas and saul returned to jerusalem and brought with them john whose other name was mark,1,JHN.11
3369,JHN,11,NRSV,but let us go to him,you heard me say to you i am going away and i am coming to you,1,JHN.11
3370,JHN,11,NRSV,thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him,whoever says i have come to know him but does not obey his commandments is a liar and in such a person the truth does not exist but whoever obeys his word truly in this person the love of god has reached perfection,1,JHN.11
3371,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days,for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god,1,JHN.11
3372,JHN,11,NRSV,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles away and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother,and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of dalmanutha,1,JHN.11
3373,JHN,11,NRSV,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home,we intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering for we intend to do what is right not only in the lords sight but also in the sight of others,1,JHN.11
3374,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather,1,JHN.11
3375,JHN,11,NRSV,but even now i know that god will give you whatever you ask of him,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee,1,JHN.11
3376,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her your brother will rise again,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them show me a denarius,1,JHN.11
3377,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years,1,JHN.11
3378,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life,if then you are not able to do so small a thing as that why do you worry about the rest,1,JHN.11
3379,JHN,11,NRSV,those who believe in me even though they die will live and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die,therefore since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god,1,JHN.11
3380,JHN,11,NRSV,she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the messiah the son of god the one coming into the world,and you are clean though not all of you,1,JHN.11
3381,JHN,11,NRSV,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you,am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me,1,JHN.11
3382,JHN,11,NRSV,and when she heard it she got up quickly and went to him,christ however was faithful over gods house as a son and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope,1,JHN.11
3383,JHN,11,NRSV,now jesus had not yet come to the village but was still at the place where martha had met him,for this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal,1,JHN.11
3384,JHN,11,NRSV,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out,when he came to galilee the galileans welcomed him since they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival,1,JHN.11
3385,JHN,11,NRSV,they followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,1,JHN.11
3386,JHN,11,NRSV,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died,he is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that god wills,1,JHN.11
3387,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved,paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1,JHN.11
3388,JHN,11,NRSV,he said where have you laid him,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way,1,JHN.11
3389,JHN,11,NRSV,they said to him lord come and see,soon afterwards he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him,1,JHN.11
3390,JHN,11,NRSV,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying,look those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces,1,JHN.11
3391,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus again greatly disturbed came to the tomb,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus,1,JHN.11
3392,JHN,11,NRSV,it was a cave and a stone was lying against it,it is before their own lord that they stand or fall,1,JHN.11
3393,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said take away the stone,the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word love your neighbor as yourself,1,JHN.11
3394,JHN,11,NRSV,martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human,1,JHN.11
3395,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,1,JHN.11
3396,JHN,11,NRSV,so they took away the stone,now there were seven brothers the first married and died childless then the second and the third married her and so in the same way all seven died childless,1,JHN.11
3397,JHN,11,NRSV,and jesus looked upward and said father i thank you for having heard me,it was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him,1,JHN.11
3398,JHN,11,NRSV,i knew that you always hear me but i have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me,i have written something to the church but diotrephes who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority,1,JHN.11
3399,JHN,11,NRSV,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth,therefore one must be subject not only because of wrath but also because of conscience,1,JHN.11
3400,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to them unbind him and let him go,and it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people,1,JHN.11
3401,JHN,11,NRSV,many of the jews therefore who had come with mary and had seen what jesus did believed in him,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,1,JHN.11
3402,JHN,11,NRSV,but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what he had done,and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us,1,JHN.11
3403,JHN,11,NRSV,so the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the council and said what are we to do,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him,1,JHN.11
3404,JHN,11,NRSV,this man is performing many signs,even upon my slaves both men and women in those days i will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy,1,JHN.11
3405,JHN,11,NRSV,if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation,they said to him where is he,1,JHN.11
3406,JHN,11,NRSV,but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all you do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed,but i tell you from now on you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven,1,JHN.11
3407,JHN,11,NRSV,he did not say this on his own but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus was about to die for the nation and not for the nation only but to gather into one the dispersed children of god,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1,JHN.11
3408,JHN,11,NRSV,so from that day on they planned to put him to death,as they went away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at,1,JHN.11
3409,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the jews but went from there to a town called ephraim in the region near the wilderness and he remained there with the disciples,you blind guides you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence,1,JHN.11
3410,JHN,11,NRSV,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side,1,JHN.11
3411,JHN,11,NRSV,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves,1,JHN.11
3412,JHN,11,NRSV,surely he will not come to the festival will he,he denied it and said i am not,1,JHN.11
3413,JHN,11,NRSV,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,now that day was a sabbath,1,JHN.11
3469,JHN,13,NRSV,now before the festival of the passover jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the father,do i say this on human authority,1,JHN.13
3470,JHN,13,NRSV,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end,i know who you are the holy one of god,1,JHN.13
3471,JHN,13,NRSV,the devil had already put it into the heart of judas son of simon iscariot to betray him,woe to you who are laughing now for you will mourn and weep,1,JHN.13
3472,JHN,13,NRSV,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself,i know that you cannot tolerate evildoers you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them to be false,1,JHN.13
3473,JHN,13,NRSV,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him,for from him and through him and to him are all things,1,JHN.13
3474,JHN,13,NRSV,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations,1,JHN.13
3475,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon,1,JHN.13
3476,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him you will never wash my feet,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,1,JHN.13
3477,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me,when he arrived the jews who had gone down from jerusalem surrounded him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove,1,JHN.13
3478,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him one who has bathed does not need to wash except for the feet but is entirely clean,entirely out of place is obscene silly and vulgar talk but instead let there be thanksgiving,1,JHN.13
3479,JHN,13,NRSV,and you are clean though not all of you,but if anyone does sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world,1,JHN.13
3480,JHN,13,NRSV,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,this is indeed the will of my father that all who see the son and believe in him may have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day,1,JHN.13
3481,JHN,13,NRSV,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you,you are observing special days and months and seasons and years,1,JHN.13
3482,JHN,13,NRSV,you call me teacher and lordand you are right for that is what i am,he asked do you understand what you are reading,1,JHN.13
3483,JHN,13,NRSV,so if i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet,when jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side a great crowd gathered around him and he was by the sea,1,JHN.13
3484,JHN,13,NRSV,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping,1,JHN.13
3485,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them,then i saw another portent in heaven great and amazing seven angels with seven plagues which are the last for with them the wrath of god is ended,1,JHN.13
3486,JHN,13,NRSV,if you know these things you are blessed if you do them,not that i seek the gift but i seek the profit that accumulates to your account,1,JHN.13
3487,JHN,13,NRSV,i am not speaking of all of you i know whom i have chosen,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit,1,JHN.13
3488,JHN,13,NRSV,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me,will not both fall into a pit,1,JHN.13
3489,JHN,13,NRSV,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he,do not seek to be free,1,JHN.13
3490,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me,he questioned him at some length but jesus gave him no answer,1,JHN.13
3491,JHN,13,NRSV,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me,they told him in bethlehem of judea for so it has been written by the prophet and you bethlehem in the land of judah are by no means least among the rulers of judah for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people israel,1,JHN.13
3492,JHN,13,NRSV,the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he was speaking,i think it right as long as i am in this body to refresh your memory since i know that my death will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me,1,JHN.13
3493,JHN,13,NRSV,one of his disciplesthe one whom jesus lovedwas reclining next to him simon peter therefore motioned to him to ask jesus of whom he was speaking,be subject to one another out of reverence for christ,1,JHN.13
3494,JHN,13,NRSV,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,a windstorm swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in danger,1,JHN.13
3495,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered it is the one to whom i give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye,1,JHN.13
3496,JHN,13,NRSV,so when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot,then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah,1,JHN.13
3497,JHN,13,NRSV,after he received the piece of bread satan entered into him,for last night there stood by me an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i worship and he said do not be afraid paul you must stand before the emperor and indeed god has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you,1,JHN.13
3498,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,1,JHN.13
3499,JHN,13,NRSV,now no one at the table knew why he said this to him,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel,1,JHN.13
3500,JHN,13,NRSV,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor,holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one,1,JHN.13
3501,JHN,13,NRSV,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic,1,JHN.13
3502,JHN,13,NRSV,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him,i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg,1,JHN.13
3503,JHN,13,NRSV,if god has been glorified in him god will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once,he trusts in god let god deliver him now if he wants to for he said i am gods son,1,JHN.13
3504,JHN,13,NRSV,little children i am with you only a little longer,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father or who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him,1,JHN.13
3505,JHN,13,NRSV,you will look for me and as i said to the jews so now i say to you where i am going you cannot come,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,1,JHN.13
3506,JHN,13,NRSV,i give you a new commandment that you love one another,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother,1,JHN.13
3507,JHN,13,NRSV,just as i have loved you you also should love one another,for i also am a man under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it,1,JHN.13
3508,JHN,13,NRSV,by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another,after we had sailed across the sea that is off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia,1,JHN.13
3509,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord where are you going,immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him,1,JHN.13
3510,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow afterward,may the god of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another in accordance with christ jesus so that together you may with one voice glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ,1,JHN.13
3511,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him,1,JHN.13
3512,JHN,13,NRSV,i will lay down my life for you,let all that you do be done in love,1,JHN.13
3513,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered will you lay down your life for me,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,1,JHN.13
3514,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you before the cock crows you will have denied me three times,i do not want to seem as though i am trying to frighten you with my letters,1,JHN.13
3515,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled,what i am saying brothers and sisters is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable,1,JHN.14
3516,JHN,14,NRSV,believe in god believe also in me,i do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink,1,JHN.14
3517,JHN,14,NRSV,in my fathers house there are many dwelling places,my brothers and sisters this ought not to be so,1,JHN.14
3518,JHN,14,NRSV,if it were not so would i have told you that i go to prepare a place for you,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me,1,JHN.14
3519,JHN,14,NRSV,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself so that where i am there you may be also,for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers the night is far gone the day is near,1,JHN.14
3520,JHN,14,NRSV,and you know the way to the place where i am going,he said to them now draw some out and take it to the chief steward,1,JHN.14
3521,JHN,14,NRSV,thomas said to him lord we do not know where you are going,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here,1,JHN.14
3522,JHN,14,NRSV,how can we know the way,perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brotherespecially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the lord,1,JHN.14
3523,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive,1,JHN.14
3524,JHN,14,NRSV,no one comes to the father except through me,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god,1,JHN.14
3525,JHN,14,NRSV,if you know me you will know my father also,therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies to make you obey their passions,1,JHN.14
3526,JHN,14,NRSV,from now on you do know him and have seen him,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it,1,JHN.14
3527,JHN,14,NRSV,philip said to him lord show us the father and we will be satisfied,some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him,1,JHN.14
3528,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him have i been with you all this time philip and you still do not know me,in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins,1,JHN.14
3529,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever has seen me has seen the father,at the same time he hoped that money would be given him by paul and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him,1,JHN.14
3530,JHN,14,NRSV,how can you say show us the father,but to the rest of you in thyatira who do not hold this teaching who have not learned what some call the deep things of satan to you i say i do not lay on you any other burden only hold fast to what you have until i come,1,JHN.14
3531,JHN,14,NRSV,do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained,1,JHN.14
3532,JHN,14,NRSV,the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own but the father who dwells in me does his works,i hope to come to you soon but i am writing these instructions to you so that if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and bulwark of the truth,1,JHN.14
3533,JHN,14,NRSV,believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me but if you do not then believe me because of the works themselves,a good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap for the measure you give will be the measure you get back,1,JHN.14
3534,JHN,14,NRSV,very truly i tell you the one who believes in me will also do the works that i do and in fact will do greater works than these because i am going to the father,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,1,JHN.14
3535,JHN,14,NRSV,i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect,1,JHN.14
3536,JHN,14,NRSV,if in my name you ask me for anything i will do it,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men,1,JHN.14
3537,JHN,14,NRSV,if you love me you will keep my commandments,while i was doing this they found me in the temple completing the rite of purification without any crowd or disturbance,1,JHN.14
3538,JHN,14,NRSV,and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you forever,and as john was finishing his work he said what do you suppose that i am,1,JHN.14
3539,JHN,14,NRSV,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth,1,JHN.14
3540,JHN,14,NRSV,you know him because he abides with you and he will be in you,then he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles,1,JHN.14
3541,JHN,14,NRSV,i will not leave you orphaned i am coming to you,when king herod heard this he was frightened and all jerusalem with him and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the messiah was to be born,1,JHN.14
3542,JHN,14,NRSV,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers,1,JHN.14
3543,JHN,14,NRSV,on that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it,1,JHN.14
3544,JHN,14,NRSV,they who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me and those who love me will be loved by my father and i will love them and reveal myself to them,but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king,1,JHN.14
3545,JHN,14,NRSV,judas not iscariot said to him lord how is it that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven,1,JHN.14
3546,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus answered him those who love me will keep my word and my father will love them and we will come to them and make our home with them,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi,1,JHN.14
3547,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me,the good person brings good things out of a good treasure and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure,1,JHN.14
3548,JHN,14,NRSV,i have said these things to you while i am still with you,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants,1,JHN.14
3549,JHN,14,NRSV,but the advocate the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you,i will not leave you orphaned i am coming to you,1,JHN.14
3550,JHN,14,NRSV,peace i leave with you my peace i give to you,one of the two who heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother,1,JHN.14
3551,JHN,14,NRSV,i do not give to you as the world gives,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,1,JHN.14
3552,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled and do not let them be afraid,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand,1,JHN.14
3553,JHN,14,NRSV,you heard me say to you i am going away and i am coming to you,then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean,1,JHN.14
3554,JHN,14,NRSV,if you loved me you would rejoice that i am going to the father because the father is greater than i,beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god for many false prophets have gone out into the world,1,JHN.14
3555,JHN,14,NRSV,and now i have told you this before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe,then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her children those who keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus,1,JHN.14
3556,JHN,14,NRSV,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison,1,JHN.14
3557,JHN,14,NRSV,he has no power over me but i do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that i love the father,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this,1,JHN.14
3558,JHN,14,NRSV,rise let us be on our way,the jews answered it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you though only a human being are making yourself god,1,JHN.14
3633,JHN,17,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he looked up to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify your son so that the son may glorify you since you have given him authority over all people to give eternal life to all whom you have given him,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord,1,JHN.17
3634,JHN,17,NRSV,and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,1,JHN.17
3635,JHN,17,NRSV,i glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do,do we not have the right to our food and drink,1,JHN.17
3636,JHN,17,NRSV,so now father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that i had in your presence before the world existed,but there were some jews from asiathey ought to be here before you to make an accusation if they have anything against me,1,JHN.17
3637,JHN,17,NRSV,i have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven,1,JHN.17
3638,JHN,17,NRSV,they were yours and you gave them to me and they have kept your word,and others said it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old,1,JHN.17
3639,JHN,17,NRSV,now they know that everything you have given me is from you for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me,jesus knew that they wanted to ask him so he said to them are you discussing among yourselves what i meant when i said a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me,1,JHN.17
3640,JHN,17,NRSV,i am asking on their behalf i am not asking on behalf of the world but on behalf of those whom you gave me because they are yours,be made clean immediately his leprosy was cleansed,1,JHN.17
3641,JHN,17,NRSV,all mine are yours and yours are mine and i have been glorified in them,and i heard the angel of the waters say you are just o holy one who are and were for you have judged these things because they shed the blood of saints and prophets you have given them blood to drink,1,JHN.17
3642,JHN,17,NRSV,and now i am no longer in the world but they are in the world and i am coming to you,but turning and looking at his disciples he rebuked peter and said get behind me satan for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things,1,JHN.17
3643,JHN,17,NRSV,holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,1,JHN.17
3644,JHN,17,NRSV,while i was with them i protected them in your name that you have given me,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith the lord replied if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you,1,JHN.17
3645,JHN,17,NRSV,i guarded them and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost so that the scripture might be fulfilled,when jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be made well,1,JHN.17
3646,JHN,17,NRSV,but now i am coming to you and i speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children,1,JHN.17
3647,JHN,17,NRSV,i have given them your word and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world,the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the lords great and glorious day,1,JHN.17
3648,JHN,17,NRSV,i am not asking you to take them out of the world but i ask you to protect them from the evil one,so i ask have they stumbled so as to fall,1,JHN.17
3649,JHN,17,NRSV,they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world,when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his relatives the israelites,1,JHN.17
3650,JHN,17,NRSV,sanctify them in the truth your word is truth,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it,1,JHN.17
3651,JHN,17,NRSV,as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world,while they were eating he took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to them and said take this is my body,1,JHN.17
3652,JHN,17,NRSV,and for their sakes i sanctify myself so that they also may be sanctified in truth,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name,1,JHN.17
3653,JHN,17,NRSV,i ask not only on behalf of these but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word that they may all be one,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword,1,JHN.17
3654,JHN,17,NRSV,as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me,i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you,1,JHN.17
3655,JHN,17,NRSV,the glory that you have given me i have given them so that they may be one as we are one i in them and you in me that they may become completely one so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me,the lord said to him get up and go to the street called straight and at the house of judas look for a man of tarsus named saul,1,JHN.17
3656,JHN,17,NRSV,father i desire that those also whom you have given me may be with me where i am to see my glory which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world,and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other,1,JHN.17
3657,JHN,17,NRSV,righteous father the world does not know you but i know you and these know that you have sent me,and someone ran filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink saying wait let us see whether elijah will come to take him down,1,JHN.17
3658,JHN,17,NRSV,i made your name known to them and i will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them and i in them,and get the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to celebrate,1,JHN.17
3659,JHN,18,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples across the kidron valley to a place where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered,it is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not mourn,1,JHN.18
3660,JHN,18,NRSV,now judas who betrayed him also knew the place because jesus often met there with his disciples,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again,1,JHN.18
3661,JHN,18,NRSV,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work,1,JHN.18
3662,JHN,18,NRSV,then jesus knowing all that was to happen to him came forward and asked them whom are you looking for,let it be assumed that i did not burden you,1,JHN.18
3663,JHN,18,NRSV,judas who betrayed him was standing with them,the tribune came and asked paul tell me are you a roman citizen,1,JHN.18
3664,JHN,18,NRSV,when jesus said to them i am he they stepped back and fell to the ground,when the woman saw that she could not remain hidden she came trembling and falling down before him she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed,1,JHN.18
3665,JHN,18,NRSV,again he asked them whom are you looking for,people will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations,1,JHN.18
3666,JHN,18,NRSV,and they said jesus of nazareth,neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me,1,JHN.18
3667,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i told you that i am he,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals,1,JHN.18
3668,JHN,18,NRSV,so if you are looking for me let these men go,and to the angel of the church in laodicea write the words of the amen the faithful and true witness the origin of gods creation i know your works you are neither cold nor hot,1,JHN.18
3669,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word that he had spoken i did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town,1,JHN.18
3670,JHN,18,NRSV,then simon peter who had a sword drew it struck the high priests slave and cut off his right ear,suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell,1,JHN.18
3671,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus said to peter put your sword back into its sheath,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly,1,JHN.18
3672,JHN,18,NRSV,am i not to drink the cup that the father has given me,but the lord answered him and said you hypocrites does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water,1,JHN.18
3673,JHN,18,NRSV,so the soldiers their officer and the jewish police arrested jesus and bound him,at that moment there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the god of heaven,1,JHN.18
3674,JHN,18,NRSV,first they took him to annas who was the fatherinlaw of caiaphas the high priest that year,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish,1,JHN.18
3675,JHN,18,NRSV,caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it was better to have one person die for the people,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ,1,JHN.18
3676,JHN,18,NRSV,simon peter and another disciple followed jesus,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord,1,JHN.18
3677,JHN,18,NRSV,since that disciple was known to the high priest he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest but peter was standing outside at the gate,all the crowds were amazed and said can this be the son of david,1,JHN.18
3678,JHN,18,NRSV,so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out spoke to the woman who guarded the gate and brought peter in,but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place,1,JHN.18
3679,JHN,18,NRSV,the woman said to peter you are not also one of this mans disciples are you,is it not the rich who oppress you,1,JHN.18
3680,JHN,18,NRSV,now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing around it and warming themselves,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day,1,JHN.18
3681,JHN,18,NRSV,peter also was standing with them and warming himself,he said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die,1,JHN.18
3682,JHN,18,NRSV,then the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven,1,JHN.18
3683,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i have spoken openly to the world i have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord,1,JHN.18
3684,JHN,18,NRSV,i have said nothing in secret,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me,1,JHN.18
3685,JHN,18,NRSV,ask those who heard what i said to them they know what i said,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross,1,JHN.18
3686,JHN,18,NRSV,when he had said this one of the police standing nearby struck jesus on the face saying is that how you answer the high priest,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head,1,JHN.18
3687,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered if i have spoken wrongly testify to the wrong,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel,1,JHN.18
3688,JHN,18,NRSV,but if i have spoken rightly why do you strike me,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you,1,JHN.18
3689,JHN,18,NRSV,then annas sent him bound to caiaphas the high priest,then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat,1,JHN.18
3690,JHN,18,NRSV,now simon peter was standing and warming himself,he it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds,1,JHN.18
3691,JHN,18,NRSV,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you,so i refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way,1,JHN.18
3692,JHN,18,NRSV,he denied it and said i am not,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1,JHN.18
3693,JHN,18,NRSV,one of the slaves of the high priest a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off asked did i not see you in the garden with him,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place,1,JHN.18
3694,JHN,18,NRSV,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed,they offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain,1,JHN.18
3695,JHN,18,NRSV,then they took jesus from caiaphas to pilates headquarters,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night,1,JHN.18
3696,JHN,18,NRSV,it was early in the morning,someone told him look your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you,1,JHN.18
3697,JHN,18,NRSV,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover,and in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people there they shall be called children of the living god,1,JHN.18
3698,JHN,18,NRSV,so pilate went out to them and said what accusation do you bring against this man,do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer and then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol,1,JHN.18
3699,JHN,18,NRSV,they answered if this man were not a criminal we would not have handed him over to you,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped,1,JHN.18
3700,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1,JHN.18
3701,JHN,18,NRSV,the jews replied we are not permitted to put anyone to death,this he said is what you have heard from me for john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now,1,JHN.18
3702,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill what jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die then pilate entered the headquarters again summoned jesus and asked him are you the king of the jews,but he was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are perishing,1,JHN.18
3703,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered do you ask this on your own or did others tell you about me,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the one who was paralyzedi say to you stand up and take your bed and go to your home,1,JHN.18
3704,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate replied i am not a jew am i,therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things,1,JHN.18
3705,JHN,18,NRSV,your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me,and we will do this if god permits,1,JHN.18
3706,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered my kingdom is not from this world,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back,1,JHN.18
3707,JHN,18,NRSV,if my kingdom were from this world my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the jews,when they reached ephesus he left them there but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews,1,JHN.18
3708,JHN,18,NRSV,but as it is my kingdom is not from here,and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation,1,JHN.18
3709,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him so you are a king,on either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit producing its fruit each month and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations,1,JHN.18
3710,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered you say that i am a king,for neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything but a new creation is everything as for those who will follow this rulepeace be upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god,1,JHN.18
3711,JHN,18,NRSV,for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it,1,JHN.18
3712,JHN,18,NRSV,everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice,there they gave a dinner for him,1,JHN.18
3713,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him what is truth,and let everyone who is thirsty come,1,JHN.18
3714,JHN,18,NRSV,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him,so when they had come together they asked him lord is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to israel,1,JHN.18
3715,JHN,18,NRSV,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover,be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life,1,JHN.18
3716,JHN,18,NRSV,do you want me to release for you the king of the jews,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace,1,JHN.18
3717,JHN,18,NRSV,they shouted in reply not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a bandit,if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die,1,JHN.18
3718,JHN,19,NRSV,then pilate took jesus and had him flogged,then herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared,1,JHN.19
3719,JHN,19,NRSV,and the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they dressed him in a purple robe,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard,1,JHN.19
3720,JHN,19,NRSV,they kept coming up to him saying hail king of the jews and striking him on the face,they stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes then they suddenly confronted him seized him and brought him before the council,1,JHN.19
3721,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate went out again and said to them look i am bringing him out to you to let you know that i find no case against him,it is by your holding fast to the word of life that i can boast on the day of christ that i did not run in vain or labor in vain,1,JHN.19
3722,JHN,19,NRSV,so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe,i am the root and the descendant of david the bright morning star,1,JHN.19
3723,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate said to them here is the man when the chief priests and the police saw him they shouted crucify him crucify him pilate said to them take him yourselves and crucify him i find no case against him,for he looked forward to the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is god,1,JHN.19
3724,JHN,19,NRSV,the jews answered him we have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the son of god,but those tenants said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours,1,JHN.19
3725,JHN,19,NRSV,now when pilate heard this he was more afraid than ever,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region,1,JHN.19
3726,JHN,19,NRSV,he entered his headquarters again and asked jesus where are you from,jesus said to him why do you call me good,1,JHN.19
3727,JHN,19,NRSV,but jesus gave him no answer,they said to him because no one has hired us,1,JHN.19
3728,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate therefore said to him do you refuse to speak to me,then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who lives forever and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended,1,JHN.19
3729,JHN,19,NRSV,do you not know that i have power to release you and power to crucify you,the natives showed us unusual kindness,1,JHN.19
3730,JHN,19,NRSV,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin,early in the morning he came again to the temple,1,JHN.19
3731,JHN,19,NRSV,from then on pilate tried to release him but the jews cried out if you release this man you are no friend of the emperor,others have labored and you have entered into their labor,1,JHN.19
3732,JHN,19,NRSV,everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor,we were in all two hundred seventysix persons in the ship after they had satisfied their hunger they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea,1,JHN.19
3733,JHN,19,NRSV,when pilate heard these words he brought jesus outside and sat on the judges bench at a place called the stone pavement or in hebrew gabbatha,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things,1,JHN.19
3734,JHN,19,NRSV,now it was the day of preparation for the passover and it was about noon,but philip found himself at azotus and as he was passing through the region he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to caesarea,1,JHN.19
3735,JHN,19,NRSV,he said to the jews here is your king they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate asked them shall i crucify your king,is not this the carpenters son,1,JHN.19
3736,JHN,19,NRSV,the chief priests answered we have no king but the emperor,i am sending him that is my own heart back to you,1,JHN.19
3737,JHN,19,NRSV,then he handed him over to them to be crucified,from noon on darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,1,JHN.19
3738,JHN,19,NRSV,so they took jesus and carrying the cross by himself he went out to what is called the place of the skull which in hebrew is called golgotha,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child,1,JHN.19
3739,JHN,19,NRSV,there they crucified him and with him two others one on either side with jesus between them,but i do know him and i keep his word,1,JHN.19
3740,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross,for his life is taken away from the earth,1,JHN.19
3741,JHN,19,NRSV,it read jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,1,JHN.19
3742,JHN,19,NRSV,many of the jews read this inscription because the place where jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in hebrew in latin and in greek,then judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them,1,JHN.19
3743,JHN,19,NRSV,then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not write the king of the jews but this man said i am king of the jews,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns,1,JHN.19
3744,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate answered what i have written i have written,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner,1,JHN.19
3745,JHN,19,NRSV,when the soldiers had crucified jesus they took his clothes and divided them into four parts one for each soldier,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin,1,JHN.19
3746,JHN,19,NRSV,they also took his tunic now the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from the top,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,1,JHN.19
3747,JHN,19,NRSV,so they said to one another let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see who will get it,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved,1,JHN.19
3748,JHN,19,NRSV,this was to fulfill what the scripture says they divided my clothes among themselves and for my clothing they cast lots,and how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard,1,JHN.19
3749,JHN,19,NRSV,and that is what the soldiers did,who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit,1,JHN.19
3750,JHN,19,NRSV,meanwhile standing near the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene,after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree,1,JHN.19
3751,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her he said to his mother woman here is your son,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham,1,JHN.19
3752,JHN,19,NRSV,then he said to the disciple here is your mother,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill,1,JHN.19
3753,JHN,19,NRSV,and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home,do you also want to become his disciples,1,JHN.19
3754,JHN,19,NRSV,after this when jesus knew that all was now finished he said in order to fulfill the scripture i am thirsty,so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs,1,JHN.19
3755,JHN,19,NRSV,a jar full of sour wine was standing there,those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it,1,JHN.19
3756,JHN,19,NRSV,so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth,if you conquer you will be clothed like them in white robes and i will not blot your name out of the book of life i will confess your name before my father and before his angels,1,JHN.19
3757,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus had received the wine he said it is finished,then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned,1,JHN.19
3758,JHN,19,NRSV,then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day,1,JHN.19
3759,JHN,19,NRSV,since it was the day of preparation the jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity,but fornication and impurity of any kind or greed must not even be mentioned among you as is proper among saints,1,JHN.19
3760,JHN,19,NRSV,so they asked pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse,1,JHN.19
3761,JHN,19,NRSV,then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness,1,JHN.19
3762,JHN,19,NRSV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,there were also many lepers in israel in the time of the prophet elisha and none of them was cleansed except naaman the syrian,1,JHN.19
3763,JHN,19,NRSV,instead one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and at once blood and water came out,then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died,1,JHN.19
3764,JHN,19,NRSV,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe,for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth,1,JHN.19
3765,JHN,19,NRSV,his testimony is true and he knows that he tells the truth these things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled none of his bones shall be broken,and early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea,1,JHN.19
3766,JHN,19,NRSV,and again another passage of scripture says they will look on the one whom they have pierced,if they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind they would have had opportunity to return,1,JHN.19
3767,JHN,19,NRSV,after these things joseph of arimathea who was a disciple of jesus though a secret one because of his fear of the jews asked pilate to let him take away the body of jesus,i rejoice in the lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me indeed you were concerned for me but had no opportunity to show it,1,JHN.19
3768,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate gave him permission so he came and removed his body,when his mother mary had been engaged to joseph but before they lived together she was found to be with child from the holy spirit,1,JHN.19
3769,JHN,19,NRSV,nicodemus who had at first come to jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds,when it was evening he came with the twelve,1,JHN.19
3770,JHN,19,NRSV,they took the body of jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths according to the burial custom of the jews,when paul had laid his hands on them the holy spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied altogether there were about twelve of them,1,JHN.19
3771,JHN,19,NRSV,now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid,when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to god he said as for these things that you see the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another all will be thrown down,1,JHN.19
3772,JHN,19,NRSV,and so because it was the jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there,now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there,1,JHN.19
3811,JHN,21,NRSV,after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the sea of tiberias and he showed himself in this way,he said then father i beg you to send him to my fathers house for i have five brothersthat he may warn them so that they will not also come into this place of torment,1,JHN.21
3812,JHN,21,NRSV,gathered there together were simon peter thomas called the twin nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples,as he entered a village ten lepers approached him,1,JHN.21
3813,JHN,21,NRSV,simon peter said to them i am going fishing,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection,1,JHN.21
3814,JHN,21,NRSV,they said to him we will go with you,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first,1,JHN.21
3815,JHN,21,NRSV,they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you,1,JHN.21
3816,JHN,21,NRSV,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus,once more they said hallelujah the smoke goes up from her forever and ever,1,JHN.21
3817,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them children you have no fish have you,for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from fornication that each one of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor not with lustful passion like the gentiles who do not know god that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister in this matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you,1,JHN.21
3818,JHN,21,NRSV,they answered him no he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some,while jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them on the way see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified and on the third day he will be raised,1,JHN.21
3819,JHN,21,NRSV,so they cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son,1,JHN.21
3820,JHN,21,NRSV,that disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord when simon peter heard that it was the lord he put on some clothes for he was naked and jumped into the sea,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me,1,JHN.21
3821,JHN,21,NRSV,but the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not far from the land only about a hundred yards off,he would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating and no one gave him anything,1,JHN.21
3822,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had gone ashore they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and bread,and if your foot causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell,1,JHN.21
3823,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them bring some of the fish that you have just caught,but these have no root they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away,1,JHN.21
3824,JHN,21,NRSV,so simon peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish a hundred fiftythree of them and though there were so many the net was not torn,they said it is his angel,1,JHN.21
3825,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them come and have breakfast,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place,1,JHN.21
3826,JHN,21,NRSV,now none of the disciples dared to ask him who are you,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him,1,JHN.21
3827,JHN,21,NRSV,because they knew it was the lord,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him,1,JHN.21
3828,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish,this agrees with the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and i will rebuild the dwelling of david which has fallen from its ruins i will rebuild it and i will set it up so that all other peoples may seek the lord even all the gentiles over whom my name has been called,1,JHN.21
3829,JHN,21,NRSV,this was now the third time that jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead,each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor,1,JHN.21
3830,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had finished breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit that dwells in you,1,JHN.21
3831,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us give thanks by which we offer to god an acceptable worship with reverence and awe for indeed our god is a consuming fire,1,JHN.21
3832,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him feed my lambs,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me,1,JHN.21
3833,JHN,21,NRSV,a second time he said to him simon son of john do you love me,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus,1,JHN.21
3834,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you,send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am expecting him with the brothers,1,JHN.21
3835,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him tend my sheep,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear,1,JHN.21
3836,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you,1,JHN.21
3837,JHN,21,NRSV,peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time do you love me,he answered i will not but later he changed his mind and went,1,JHN.21
3838,JHN,21,NRSV,and he said to him lord you know everything you know that i love you,for this reason god gave them up to degrading passions,1,JHN.21
3839,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him feed my sheep,now send men to joppa for a certain simon who is called peter he is lodging with simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside,1,JHN.21
3840,JHN,21,NRSV,very truly i tell you when you were younger you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished,and when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god made you alive together with him when he forgave us all our trespasses erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands,1,JHN.21
3841,JHN,21,NRSV,but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself,1,JHN.21
3842,JHN,21,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify god after this he said to him follow me,show me the coin used for the tax,1,JHN.21
3843,JHN,21,NRSV,peter turned and saw the disciple whom jesus loved following them he was the one who had reclined next to jesus at the supper and had said lord who is it that is going to betray you,and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one buys their cargo anymore cargo of gold silver jewels and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet all kinds of scented wood all articles of ivory all articles of costly wood bronze iron and marble cinnamon spice incense myrrh frankincense wine olive oil choice flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and chariots slavesand human lives,1,JHN.21

3845,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,but he did not answer her at all,1,JHN.21
3846,JHN,21,NRSV,follow me so the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die,the one who comes from above is above all the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things,1,JHN.21
3847,JHN,21,NRSV,yet jesus did not say to him that he would not die but if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you,i appeal to you then be imitators of me,1,JHN.21
3848,JHN,21,NRSV,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry,1,JHN.21
3849,JHN,21,NRSV,but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written,when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the body to joseph,1,JHN.21
3936,ACT,4,NRSV,while peter and john were speaking to the people the priests the captain of the temple and the sadducees came to them much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in jesus there is the resurrection of the dead,what good is it my brothers and sisters if you say you have faith but do not have works,1,ACT.4
3937,ACT,4,NRSV,so they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening,all who believed were together and had all things in common they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all as any had need,1,ACT.4
3938,ACT,4,NRSV,but many of those who heard the word believed and they numbered about five thousand,at last two came forward and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days,1,ACT.4
3939,ACT,4,NRSV,the next day their rulers elders and scribes assembled in jerusalem with annas the high priest caiaphas john and alexander and all who were of the highpriestly family,he went into all the region around the jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet isaiah the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight,1,ACT.4

3942,ACT,4,NRSV,this jesus is the stone that was rejected by you the builders it has become the cornerstone,what i say to you in the dark tell in the light and what you hear whispered proclaim from the housetops,1,ACT.4
3943,ACT,4,NRSV,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved,by no means do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness,1,ACT.4
3944,ACT,4,NRSV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were amazed and recognized them as companions of jesus,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1,ACT.4
3945,ACT,4,NRSV,when they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom,1,ACT.4
3946,ACT,4,NRSV,so they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them,1,ACT.4
3947,ACT,4,NRSV,they said what will we do with them,take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter have nothing to do with them so that they may be ashamed,1,ACT.4
3948,ACT,4,NRSV,for it is obvious to all who live in jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them we cannot deny it,now after john was arrested jesus came to galilee proclaiming the good news of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe in the good news,1,ACT.4
3949,ACT,4,NRSV,but to keep it from spreading further among the people let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name,the people kept shouting the voice of a god and not of a mortal and immediately because he had not given the glory to god an angel of the lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died,1,ACT.4
3950,ACT,4,NRSV,so they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus,he must never drink wine or strong drink even before his birth he will be filled with the holy spirit,1,ACT.4
3951,ACT,4,NRSV,but peter and john answered them whether it is right in gods sight to listen to you rather than to god you must judge for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,1,ACT.4
3952,ACT,4,NRSV,after threatening them again they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for all of them praised god for what had happened,many samaritans from that city believed in him because of the womans testimony he told me everything i have ever done,1,ACT.4

3957,ACT,4,NRSV,for in this city in fact both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the peoples of israel gathered together against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place,then he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man and you will not see it,1,ACT.4
3958,ACT,4,NRSV,and now lord look at their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant jesus,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart,1,ACT.4
3959,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god with boldness,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account,1,ACT.4
3960,ACT,4,NRSV,now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions but everything they owned was held in common,likewise urge the younger men to be selfcontrolled,1,ACT.4
3961,ACT,4,NRSV,with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all,jesus answered them did i not choose you the twelve,1,ACT.4
3962,ACT,4,NRSV,there was not a needy person among them for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold,remember the word that i said to you servants are not greater than their master,1,ACT.4
3963,ACT,4,NRSV,they laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like,1,ACT.4
3964,ACT,4,NRSV,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,and you who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,1,ACT.4

4024,ACT,7,NRSV,the god of glory appeared to our ancestor abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he lived in haran and said to him leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that i will show you,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill,1,ACT.7
4025,ACT,7,NRSV,then he left the country of the chaldeans and settled in haran,whoever comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty,1,ACT.7
4026,ACT,7,NRSV,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living,now they had been sent from the pharisees,1,ACT.7
4027,ACT,7,NRSV,he did not give him any of it as a heritage not even a foots length but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him even though he had no child,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him,1,ACT.7
4028,ACT,7,NRSV,and god spoke in these terms that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years,although you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy for you are receiving the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls,1,ACT.7
4029,ACT,7,NRSV,but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place,then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach,1,ACT.7
4030,ACT,7,NRSV,then he gave him the covenant of circumcision,but if you do what is wrong you should be afraid for the authority does not bear the sword in vain it is the servant of god to execute wrath on the wrongdoer,1,ACT.7
4031,ACT,7,NRSV,and so abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day and isaac became the father of jacob and jacob of the twelve patriarchs,now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over stephen traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch and they spoke the word to no one except jews,1,ACT.7
4032,ACT,7,NRSV,the patriarchs jealous of joseph sold him into egypt but god was with him and rescued him from all his afflictions and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt who appointed him ruler over egypt and over all his household,as he taught he said beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers,1,ACT.7

4041,ACT,7,NRSV,for three months he was brought up in his fathers house and when he was abandoned pharaohs daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi,1,ACT.7
4042,ACT,7,NRSV,so moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it,1,ACT.7

4044,ACT,7,NRSV,when he saw one of them being wronged he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the egyptian,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin,1,ACT.7
4045,ACT,7,NRSV,he supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that god through him was rescuing them but they did not understand,so they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard,1,ACT.7
4046,ACT,7,NRSV,the next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them saying men you are brothers why do you wrong each other,while staying with them he ordered them not to leave jerusalem but to wait there for the promise of the father,1,ACT.7
4047,ACT,7,NRSV,but the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed moses aside saying who made you a ruler and a judge over us,for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life,1,ACT.7
4048,ACT,7,NRSV,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday,so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily,1,ACT.7
4049,ACT,7,NRSV,when he heard this moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of midian,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way,1,ACT.7

4055,ACT,7,NRSV,i have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in egypt and have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them,but jesus called them to him and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them,1,ACT.7
4056,ACT,7,NRSV,come now i will send you to egypt,all of them condemned him as deserving death,1,ACT.7

4060,ACT,7,NRSV,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret,1,ACT.7
4061,ACT,7,NRSV,he is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at mount sinai and with our ancestors and he received living oracles to give to us,therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god,1,ACT.7
4062,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors were unwilling to obey him instead they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to egypt saying to aaron make gods for us who will lead the way for us as for this moses who led us out from the land of egypt we do not know what has happened to him,by these three plagues a third of humankind was killed by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths,1,ACT.7

4066,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen,but they all alike began to make excuses,1,ACT.7
4067,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors in turn brought it in with joshua when they dispossessed the nations that god drove out before our ancestors,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work,1,ACT.7

4413,ACT,16,NRSV,one day as we were going to the place of prayer we met a slavegirl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortunetelling,now such persons we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living,1,ACT.16
4414,ACT,16,NRSV,while she followed paul and us she would cry out these men are slaves of the most high god who proclaim to you a way of salvation,then jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last,1,ACT.16

4419,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had brought them before the magistrates they said these men are disturbing our city they are jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as romans to adopt or observe,then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land,1,ACT.16
4420,ACT,16,NRSV,the crowd joined in attacking them and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law,1,ACT.16

4425,ACT,16,NRSV,when the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped,and all of them said the same,1,ACT.16
4426,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul shouted in a loud voice do not harm yourself for we are all here,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation,1,ACT.16
4427,ACT,16,NRSV,the jailer called for lights and rushing in he fell down trembling before paul and silas,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast on that day,1,ACT.16
4428,ACT,16,NRSV,then he brought them outside and said sirs what must i do to be saved,paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,1,ACT.16
4429,ACT,16,NRSV,they answered believe on the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household,and fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord,1,ACT.16

4431,ACT,16,NRSV,at the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds then he and his entire family were baptized without delay,it was also about these that enoch in the seventh generation from adam prophesied saying see the lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him,1,ACT.16
4432,ACT,16,NRSV,he brought them up into the house and set food before them and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in god,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight,1,ACT.16
4433,ACT,16,NRSV,when morning came the magistrates sent the police saying let those men go,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear,1,ACT.16
4434,ACT,16,NRSV,and the jailer reported the message to paul saying the magistrates sent word to let you go therefore come out now and go in peace,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded,1,ACT.16
4435,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul replied they have beaten us in public uncondemned men who are roman citizens and have thrown us into prison and now are they going to discharge us in secret,so he took him brought him to the tribune and said the prisoner paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you he has something to tell you,1,ACT.16
4436,ACT,16,NRSV,certainly not let them come and take us out themselves,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you,1,ACT.16
4437,ACT,16,NRSV,the police reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were roman citizens so they came and apologized to them,and so we came to rome,1,ACT.16
4438,ACT,16,NRSV,and they took them out and asked them to leave the city,even so many will follow their licentious ways and because of these teachers the way of truth will be maligned,1,ACT.16
4439,ACT,16,NRSV,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there they departed,what is this wisdom that has been given to him,1,ACT.16
4751,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul you have permission to speak for yourself,the angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls,1,ACT.26
4752,ACT,26,NRSV,then paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself i consider myself fortunate that it is before you king agrippa i am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the jews because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the jews therefore i beg of you to listen to me patiently,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us,1,ACT.26
4753,ACT,26,NRSV,all the jews know my way of life from my youth a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in jerusalem,and the spirit is the one that testifies for the spirit is the truth,1,ACT.26
4754,ACT,26,NRSV,they have known for a long time if they are willing to testify that i have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a pharisee,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god,1,ACT.26
4755,ACT,26,NRSV,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night,we have four men who are under a vow,1,ACT.26
4756,ACT,26,NRSV,it is for this hope your excellency that i am accused by jews why is it thought incredible by any of you that god raises the dead,peter answered the messiah of god,1,ACT.26
4757,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed i myself was convinced that i ought to do many things against the name of jesus of nazareth,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,1,ACT.26
4758,ACT,26,NRSV,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,1,ACT.26
4759,ACT,26,NRSV,by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to blaspheme and since i was so furiously enraged at them i pursued them even to foreign cities,but peter said to him may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain gods gift with money you have no part or share in this for your heart is not right before god,1,ACT.26
4760,ACT,26,NRSV,with this in mind i was traveling to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests when at midday along the road your excellency i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions,you have already been cleansed by the word that i have spoken to you,1,ACT.26
4761,ACT,26,NRSV,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory,1,ACT.26
4762,ACT,26,NRSV,it hurts you to kick against the goads,so when they met here i lost no time but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought,1,ACT.26
4763,ACT,26,NRSV,i asked who are you lord,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,1,ACT.26
4764,ACT,26,NRSV,the lord answered i am jesus whom you are persecuting,then looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him ephphatha that is be opened,1,ACT.26
4765,ACT,26,NRSV,but get up and stand on your feet for i have appeared to you for this purpose to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which i will appear to you,like good stewards of the manifold grace of god serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received,1,ACT.26
4766,ACT,26,NRSV,i will rescue you from your people and from the gentilesto whom i am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me,truly i tell you not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down,1,ACT.26
4767,ACT,26,NRSV,after that king agrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but declared first to those in damascus then in jerusalem and throughout the countryside of judea and also to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do deeds consistent with repentance,each builder must choose with care how to build on it,1,ACT.26
4768,ACT,26,NRSV,for this reason the jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me,he set this aside nailing it to the cross,1,ACT.26
4769,ACT,26,NRSV,to this day i have had help from god and so i stand here testifying to both small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would take place that the messiah must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the gentiles,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea,1,ACT.26
4770,ACT,26,NRSV,while he was making this defense festus exclaimed you are out of your mind paul too much learning is driving you insane but paul said i am not out of my mind most excellent festus but i am speaking the sober truth,he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful in you,1,ACT.26
4771,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed the king knows about these things and to him i speak freely for i am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice for this was not done in a corner,yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies,1,ACT.26
4772,ACT,26,NRSV,king agrippa do you believe the prophets,then jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last,1,ACT.26
4773,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul are you so quickly persuading me to become a christian,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink,1,ACT.26
4774,ACT,26,NRSV,paul replied whether quickly or not i pray to god that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as i amexcept for these chains,while they were talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you,1,ACT.26
4775,ACT,26,NRSV,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment,so they came to him in a body and after winning over blastus the kings chamberlain they asked for a reconciliation because their country depended on the kings country for food,1,ACT.26
4776,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to festus this man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor,i wrapped it up in a piece of cloth for i was afraid of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow,1,ACT.26
4873,ROM,2,NRSV,therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things,there were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy,1,ROM.2
4874,ROM,2,NRSV,you say we know that gods judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth,for ever since our ancestors died all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation they deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of god heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished,1,ROM.2
4875,ROM,2,NRSV,do you imagine whoever you are that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself you will escape the judgment of god,the hand of the lord was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord,1,ROM.2
4876,ROM,2,NRSV,or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience,and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit,1,ROM.2
4877,ROM,2,NRSV,do you not realize that gods kindness is meant to lead you to repentance,he said all this quite openly,1,ROM.2
4878,ROM,2,NRSV,but by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when gods righteous judgment will be revealed,stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality,1,ROM.2
4879,ROM,2,NRSV,for he will repay according to each ones deeds to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life while for those who are selfseeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness there will be wrath and fury,do not even eat with such a one,1,ROM.2
4880,ROM,2,NRSV,there will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil the jew first and also the greek but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good the jew first and also the greek,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus,1,ROM.2
4881,ROM,2,NRSV,all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the futureall belong to you and you belong to christ and christ belongs to god,1,ROM.2
4882,ROM,2,NRSV,for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in gods sight but the doers of the law who will be justified,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god,1,ROM.2
4883,ROM,2,NRSV,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves,how could you fail to perceive that i was not speaking about bread,1,ROM.2
4884,ROM,2,NRSV,they show that what the law requires is written on their hearts to which their own conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them on the day when according to my gospel god through jesus christ will judge the secret thoughts of all,but if that wicked slave says to himself my master is delayed and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know,1,ROM.2
4885,ROM,2,NRSV,but if you call yourself a jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to god and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness a corrector of the foolish a teacher of children having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth you then that teach others will you not teach yourself,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,1,ROM.2
4886,ROM,2,NRSV,while you preach against stealing do you steal,when he had finished speaking he knelt down with them all and prayed,1,ROM.2
4887,ROM,2,NRSV,you that forbid adultery do you commit adultery,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,1,ROM.2
4888,ROM,2,NRSV,you that abhor idols do you rob temples,wives in the same way accept the authority of your husbands so that even if some of them do not obey the word they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct when they see the purity and reverence of your lives,1,ROM.2
4889,ROM,2,NRSV,you that boast in the law do you dishonor god by breaking the law,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives,1,ROM.2
4890,ROM,2,NRSV,for as it is written the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you,you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions,1,ROM.2
4891,ROM,2,NRSV,circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law but if you break the law your circumcision has become uncircumcision,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you,1,ROM.2
4892,ROM,2,NRSV,so if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews,1,ROM.2
4893,ROM,2,NRSV,then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law,and if you belong to christ then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to the promise,1,ROM.2
4894,ROM,2,NRSV,for a person is not a jew who is one outwardly nor is true circumcision something external and physical,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter ,1,ROM.2
4895,ROM,2,NRSV,rather a person is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heartit is spiritual and not literal,the lord is not slow about his promise as some think of slowness but is patient with you not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance,1,ROM.2
4896,ROM,2,NRSV,such a person receives praise not from others but from god,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given,1,ROM.2
5114,ROM,11,NRSV,i ask then has god rejected his people,do not lag in zeal be ardent in spirit serve the lord,1,ROM.11
5115,ROM,11,NRSV,by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin,there he found a man named aeneas who had been bedridden for eight years for he was paralyzed,1,ROM.11
5116,ROM,11,NRSV,god has not rejected his people whom he foreknew,and he will send them immediately,1,ROM.11
5117,ROM,11,NRSV,do you not know what the scripture says of elijah how he pleads with god against israel,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,1,ROM.11
5118,ROM,11,NRSV,lord they have killed your prophets they have demolished your altars i alone am left and they are seeking my life,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray,1,ROM.11
5119,ROM,11,NRSV,but what is the divine reply to him,i can will what is right but i cannot do it,1,ROM.11
5120,ROM,11,NRSV,i have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it,1,ROM.11
5121,ROM,11,NRSV,so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace,salt is good but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored,1,ROM.11
5122,ROM,11,NRSV,but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign,1,ROM.11
5123,ROM,11,NRSV,israel failed to obtain what it was seeking,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me,1,ROM.11
5124,ROM,11,NRSV,the elect obtained it but the rest were hardened as it is written god gave them a sluggish spirit eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear down to this very day,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for,1,ROM.11
5125,ROM,11,NRSV,and david says let their table become a snare and a trap a stumbling block and a retribution for them let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see and keep their backs forever bent,what then did you go out to see,1,ROM.11
5126,ROM,11,NRSV,so i ask have they stumbled so as to fall,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region,1,ROM.11
5127,ROM,11,NRSV,by no means but through their stumbling salvation has come to the gentiles so as to make israel jealous,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem,1,ROM.11
5128,ROM,11,NRSV,now if their stumbling means riches for the world and if their defeat means riches for gentiles how much more will their full inclusion mean now i am speaking to you gentiles,every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god,1,ROM.11
5129,ROM,11,NRSV,inasmuch then as i am an apostle to the gentiles i glorify my ministry in order to make my own people jealous and thus save some of them,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine,1,ROM.11
5130,ROM,11,NRSV,for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead if the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy then the whole batch is holy and if the root is holy then the branches also are holy,have you come to destroy us,1,ROM.11
5131,ROM,11,NRSV,but if some of the branches were broken off and you a wild olive shoot were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree do not boast over the branches,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god,1,ROM.11
5132,ROM,11,NRSV,if you do boast remember that it is not you that support the root but the root that supports you,then he went home and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat,1,ROM.11
5133,ROM,11,NRSV,you will say branches were broken off so that i might be grafted in,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1,ROM.11
5134,ROM,11,NRSV,they were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand only through faith,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god,1,ROM.11
5135,ROM,11,NRSV,so do not become proud but stand in awe,then i saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth,1,ROM.11
5136,ROM,11,NRSV,for if god did not spare the natural branches perhaps he will not spare you,then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor david hosanna in the highest heaven then he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve,1,ROM.11
5137,ROM,11,NRSV,note then the kindness and the severity of god severity toward those who have fallen but gods kindness toward you provided you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off,i do not give to you as the world gives,1,ROM.11
5138,ROM,11,NRSV,and even those of israel if they do not persist in unbelief will be grafted in for god has the power to graft them in again,we destroy arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of god and we take every thought captive to obey christ,1,ROM.11
5139,ROM,11,NRSV,for if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped,1,ROM.11
5140,ROM,11,NRSV,so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters i want you to understand this mystery a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of the gentiles has come in,when he had entered he said to them why do you make a commotion and weep,1,ROM.11
5141,ROM,11,NRSV,and so all israel will be saved as it is written out of zion will come the deliverer he will banish ungodliness from jacob,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be,1,ROM.11
5142,ROM,11,NRSV,and this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins,formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me,1,ROM.11
5143,ROM,11,NRSV,as regards the gospel they are enemies of god for your sake but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their ancestors for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable,with all of these take the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one,1,ROM.11
5144,ROM,11,NRSV,just as you were once disobedient to god but have now received mercy because of their disobedience so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they too may now receive mercy,when he heard this he was shocked and went away grieving for he had many possessions,1,ROM.11
5145,ROM,11,NRSV,for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all,then peter remembered and said to him rabbi look the fig tree that you cursed has withered,1,ROM.11
5146,ROM,11,NRSV,o the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways for who has known the mind of the lord,someone from the crowd answered him teacher i brought you my son he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak and whenever it seizes him it dashes him down and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid and i asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do so,1,ROM.11
5147,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has been his counselor,when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas also the books and above all the parchments,1,ROM.11
5148,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has given a gift to him to receive a gift in return,from this we know that it is the last hour,1,ROM.11
5149,ROM,11,NRSV,for from him and through him and to him are all things,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village,1,ROM.11
5150,ROM,11,NRSV,to him be the glory forever,from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute,1,ROM.11
5184,ROM,14,NRSV,welcome those who are weak in faith but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions,but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her,1,ROM.14
5185,ROM,14,NRSV,some believe in eating anything while the weak eat only vegetables,peter answered him you are the messiah,1,ROM.14
5186,ROM,14,NRSV,those who eat must not despise those who abstain and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat for god has welcomed them,all things are lawful for me but i will not be dominated by anything,1,ROM.14
5187,ROM,14,NRSV,who are you to pass judgment on servants of another,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints,1,ROM.14
5188,ROM,14,NRSV,it is before their own lord that they stand or fall,one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him,1,ROM.14
5189,ROM,14,NRSV,and they will be upheld for the lord is able to make them stand,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray,1,ROM.14
5190,ROM,14,NRSV,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus,1,ROM.14
5191,ROM,14,NRSV,let all be fully convinced in their own minds,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire,1,ROM.14
5192,ROM,14,NRSV,those who observe the day observe it in honor of the lord,take care that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you in heaven their angels continually see the face of my father in heaven,1,ROM.14
5193,ROM,14,NRSV,also those who eat eat in honor of the lord since they give thanks to god while those who abstain abstain in honor of the lord and give thanks to god,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons,1,ROM.14
5194,ROM,14,NRSV,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,1,ROM.14
5195,ROM,14,NRSV,if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords,while peter was kept in prison the church prayed fervently to god for him,1,ROM.14
5196,ROM,14,NRSV,for to this end christ died and lived again so that he might be lord of both the dead and the living,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way,1,ROM.14
5197,ROM,14,NRSV,why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt,1,ROM.14
5198,ROM,14,NRSV,or you why do you despise your brother or sister,and he said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things,1,ROM.14
5199,ROM,14,NRSV,for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god,for herod had arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because john had been telling him it is not lawful for you to have her,1,ROM.14
5200,ROM,14,NRSV,for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god,then jesus said to him put your sword back into its place for all who take the sword will perish by the sword,1,ROM.14
5201,ROM,14,NRSV,so then each of us will be accountable to god,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1,ROM.14
5202,ROM,14,NRSV,let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another but resolve instead never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of another,for one believes with the heart and so is justified and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved,1,ROM.14
5203,ROM,14,NRSV,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god,1,ROM.14
5204,ROM,14,NRSV,if your brother or sister is being injured by what you eat you are no longer walking in love,you will be enriched in every way for your great generosity which will produce thanksgiving to god through us for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to god,1,ROM.14
5205,ROM,14,NRSV,do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom christ died,but if someone stands firm in his resolve being under no necessity but having his own desire under control and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee he will do well,1,ROM.14
5206,ROM,14,NRSV,so do not let your good be spoken of as evil,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin,1,ROM.14
5207,ROM,14,NRSV,for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit,then jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal,1,ROM.14
5208,ROM,14,NRSV,the one who thus serves christ is acceptable to god and has human approval,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own,1,ROM.14
5209,ROM,14,NRSV,let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding,but gods firm foundation stands bearing this inscription the lord knows those who are his and let everyone who calls on the name of the lord turn away from wickedness,1,ROM.14
5210,ROM,14,NRSV,do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god,the high priest stood up and said have you no answer,1,ROM.14
5211,ROM,14,NRSV,everything is indeed clean but it is wrong for you to make others fall by what you eat it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother or sister stumble,and when he had stepped out of the boat immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him,1,ROM.14
5212,ROM,14,NRSV,the faith that you have have as your own conviction before god,so also when you see these things taking place you know that the kingdom of god is near,1,ROM.14
5213,ROM,14,NRSV,blessed are those who have no reason to condemn themselves because of what they approve,do not be astonished brothers and sisters that the world hates you,1,ROM.14
5214,ROM,14,NRSV,but those who have doubts are condemned if they eat because they do not act from faith for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts,1,ROM.14
5326,1CO,4,NRSV,think of us in this way as servants of christ and stewards of gods mysteries,as jesus came out of the temple and was going away his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple,1,1CO.4
5327,1CO,4,NRSV,moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy,he began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone,1,1CO.4
5328,1CO,4,NRSV,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court,jesus said take away the stone,1,1CO.4
5329,1CO,4,NRSV,i do not even judge myself,since he wanted to find out what paul was being accused of by the jews the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet,1,1CO.4
5330,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not aware of anything against myself but i am not thereby acquitted,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later,1,1CO.4
5331,1CO,4,NRSV,it is the lord who judges me,now by this we may be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments,1,1CO.4
5332,1CO,4,NRSV,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart,then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray,1,1CO.4
5333,1CO,4,NRSV,then each one will receive commendation from god,jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to those who are called who are beloved in god the father and kept safe for jesus christ may mercy peace and love be yours in abundance,1,1CO.4
5334,1CO,4,NRSV,i have applied all this to apollos and myself for your benefit brothers and sisters so that you may learn through us the meaning of the saying nothing beyond what is written so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another,besides that they learn to be idle gadding about from house to house and they are not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say,1,1CO.4
5335,1CO,4,NRSV,for who sees anything different in you,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit,1,1CO.4
5336,1CO,4,NRSV,what do you have that you did not receive,when the young man heard this word he went away grieving for he had many possessions,1,1CO.4
5337,1CO,4,NRSV,and if you received it why do you boast as if it were not a gift,how does gods love abide in anyone who has the worlds goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help,1,1CO.4
5338,1CO,4,NRSV,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near,1,1CO.4
5339,1CO,4,NRSV,we are fools for the sake of christ but you are wise in christ,and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband,1,1CO.4
5340,1CO,4,NRSV,we are weak but you are strong,the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with all of you,1,1CO.4
5341,1CO,4,NRSV,you are held in honor but we in disrepute,the dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven,1,1CO.4
5342,1CO,4,NRSV,to the present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless and we grow weary from the work of our own hands,i will write on you the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem that comes down from my god out of heaven and my own new name,1,1CO.4
5343,1CO,4,NRSV,when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure when slandered we speak kindly,blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled,1,1CO.4
5344,1CO,4,NRSV,we have become like the rubbish of the world the dregs of all things to this very day,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe,1,1CO.4
5345,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not writing this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly,1,1CO.4
5346,1CO,4,NRSV,for though you might have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers,so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters i want you to understand this mystery a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of the gentiles has come in,1,1CO.4
5347,1CO,4,NRSV,indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel,and i lay down my life for the sheep,1,1CO.4
5348,1CO,4,NRSV,i appeal to you then be imitators of me,after two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and since he wanted to grant the jews a favor felix left paul in prison,1,1CO.4
5349,1CO,4,NRSV,for this reason i sent you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath,1,1CO.4
5350,1CO,4,NRSV,but some of you thinking that i am not coming to you have become arrogant,you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment,1,1CO.4
5351,1CO,4,NRSV,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name,1,1CO.4
5352,1CO,4,NRSV,for the kingdom of god depends not on talk but on power,i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love,1,1CO.4
5353,1CO,4,NRSV,am i to come to you with a stick or with love in a spirit of gentleness,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1,1CO.4
5369,1CO,6,NRSV,when any of you has a grievance against another do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it before the saints,do bear with me i feel a divine jealousy for you for i promised you in marriage to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to christ,1,1CO.6
5370,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that the saints will judge the world,when he reached the place he said to them pray that you may not come into the time of trial,1,1CO.6
5371,1CO,6,NRSV,and if the world is to be judged by you are you incompetent to try trivial cases,the nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,1,1CO.6
5372,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that we are to judge angelsto say nothing of ordinary matters,and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning,1,1CO.6
5373,1CO,6,NRSV,if you have ordinary cases then do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church,i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg,1,1CO.6
5374,1CO,6,NRSV,i say this to your shame,when they heard this they said heaven forbid but he looked at them and said what then does this text mean the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,1,1CO.6
5375,1CO,6,NRSV,can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another but a believer goes to court against a believer and before unbelievers at that,for this reason jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters saying i will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters in the midst of the congregation i will praise you,1,1CO.6
5376,1CO,6,NRSV,in fact to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you,of course there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment for we brought nothing into the world so that we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with these,1,1CO.6
5377,1CO,6,NRSV,but you yourselves wrong and defraudand believers at that,but others said how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs,1,1CO.6
5378,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god,then i saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it the earth and the heaven fled from his presence and no place was found for them,1,1CO.6
5379,1CO,6,NRSV,do not be deceived fornicators idolaters adulterers male prostitutes sodomites thieves the greedy drunkards revilers robbersnone of these will inherit the kingdom of god,there will be two women grinding meal together one will be taken and the other left,1,1CO.6
5380,1CO,6,NRSV,and this is what some of you used to be,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband,1,1CO.6
5381,1CO,6,NRSV,but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised,1,1CO.6
5382,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but not all things are beneficial,but the magician elymas for that is the translation of his name opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith,1,1CO.6
5383,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but i will not be dominated by anything,jesus said to them the light is with you for a little longer,1,1CO.6
5384,1CO,6,NRSV,food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food and god will destroy both one and the other,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me,1,1CO.6
5385,1CO,6,NRSV,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me,1,1CO.6
5386,1CO,6,NRSV,and god raised the lord and will also raise us by his power,and they filled them up to the brim,1,1CO.6
5387,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that your bodies are members of christ,i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them,1,1CO.6
5388,1CO,6,NRSV,should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about,1,1CO.6
5389,1CO,6,NRSV,never do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her,i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,1,1CO.6
5390,1CO,6,NRSV,for it is said the two shall be one flesh,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone,1,1CO.6
5391,1CO,6,NRSV,but anyone united to the lord becomes one spirit with him,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,1,1CO.6
5392,1CO,6,NRSV,shun fornication every sin that a person commits is outside the body but the fornicator sins against the body itself,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar,1,1CO.6
5393,1CO,6,NRSV,or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from god and that you are not your own,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore,1,1CO.6
5394,1CO,6,NRSV,for you were bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body,as soon as he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john whose other name was mark where many had gathered and were praying,1,1CO.6
5448,1CO,8,NRSV,now concerning food sacrificed to idols we know that all of us possess knowledge,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words,1,1CO.8
5449,1CO,8,NRSV,knowledge puffs up but love builds up,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers,1,1CO.8
5450,1CO,8,NRSV,anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge but anyone who loves god is known by him,anyone who does not have the spirit of christ does not belong to him,1,1CO.8
5451,1CO,8,NRSV,hence as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that no idol in the world really exists and that there is no god but one,jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty,1,1CO.8
5452,1CO,8,NRSV,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist,therefore his parents said he is of age ask him,1,1CO.8
5453,1CO,8,NRSV,it is not everyone however who has this knowledge,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,1,1CO.8
5454,1CO,8,NRSV,since some have become so accustomed to idols until now they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will,1,1CO.8
5455,1CO,8,NRSV,food will not bring us close to god,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out,1,1CO.8
5456,1CO,8,NRSV,we are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do,for time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice obtained promises shut the mouths of lions quenched raging fire escaped the edge of the sword won strength out of weakness became mighty in war put foreign armies to flight,1,1CO.8
5457,1CO,8,NRSV,but take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak,for god is my witness how i long for all of you with the compassion of christ jesus,1,1CO.8
5458,1CO,8,NRSV,for if others see you who possess knowledge eating in the temple of an idol might they not since their conscience is weak be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons,1,1CO.8
5459,1CO,8,NRSV,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed,i commend to you our sister phoebe a deacon of the church at cenchreae so that you may welcome her in the lord as is fitting for the saints and help her in whatever she may require from you for she has been a benefactor of many and of myself as well,1,1CO.8
5460,1CO,8,NRSV,but when you thus sin against members of your family and wound their conscience when it is weak you sin against christ,surely he will not come to the festival will he,1,1CO.8
5461,1CO,8,NRSV,therefore if food is a cause of their falling i will never eat meat so that i may not cause one of them to fall,beloved i am writing you no new commandment but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word that you have heard,1,1CO.8
5462,1CO,9,NRSV,have i not seen jesus our lord,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,1,1CO.9
5463,1CO,9,NRSV,are you not my work in the lord,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean,1,1CO.9
5464,1CO,9,NRSV,if i am not an apostle to others at least i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores,1,1CO.9
5465,1CO,9,NRSV,this is my defense to those who would examine me,come lord jesus the grace of the lord jesus be with all the saints,1,1CO.9
5466,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to our food and drink,therefore he has also said in another psalm you will not let your holy one experience corruption,1,1CO.9
5467,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas,if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me,1,1CO.9
5468,1CO,9,NRSV,or is it only barnabas and i who have no right to refrain from working for a living,it is the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life they will wither away,1,1CO.9
5469,1CO,9,NRSV,who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service,when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day as was his custom,1,1CO.9
5470,1CO,9,NRSV,who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,1,1CO.9
5471,1CO,9,NRSV,or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge,1,1CO.9
5472,1CO,9,NRSV,do i say this on human authority,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me,1,1CO.9
5473,1CO,9,NRSV,does not the law also say the same,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself,1,1CO.9
5474,1CO,9,NRSV,for it is written in the law of moses you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,after this i looked and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues robed in pure bright linen with golden sashes across their chests,1,1CO.9
5475,1CO,9,NRSV,is it for oxen that god is concerned,he has been raised he is not here,1,1CO.9
5476,1CO,9,NRSV,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet,1,1CO.9
5477,1CO,9,NRSV,it was indeed written for our sake for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals,1,1CO.9
5478,1CO,9,NRSV,if we have sown spiritual good among you is it too much if we reap your material benefits,i think that i am not in the least inferior to these superapostles,1,1CO.9
5479,1CO,9,NRSV,if others share this rightful claim on you do not we still more,but some of them joined him and became believers including dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them,1,1CO.9
5480,1CO,9,NRSV,nevertheless we have not made use of this right but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of christ,in his testimony about him he said i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who will carry out all my wishes,1,1CO.9
5481,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar,but all his acquaintances including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things,1,1CO.9
5482,1CO,9,NRSV,in the same way the lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel,after staying there for a considerable time paul said farewell to the believers and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila,1,1CO.9
5483,1CO,9,NRSV,but i have made no use of any of these rights nor am i writing this so that they may be applied in my case,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,1,1CO.9
5484,1CO,9,NRSV,indeed i would rather die than thatno one will deprive me of my ground for boasting if i proclaim the gospel this gives me no ground for boasting for an obligation is laid on me and woe to me if i do not proclaim the gospel for if i do this of my own will i have a reward but if not of my own will i am entrusted with a commission,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised,1,1CO.9
5485,1CO,9,NRSV,just this that in my proclamation i may make the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel,then i saw thrones and those seated on them were given authority to judge,1,1CO.9
5486,1CO,9,NRSV,for though i am free with respect to all i have made myself a slave to all so that i might win more of them,now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side,1,1CO.9
5487,1CO,9,NRSV,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike,1,1CO.9
5488,1CO,9,NRSV,to those under the law i became as one under the law though i myself am not under the law so that i might win those under the law,but he said to them you give them something to eat,1,1CO.9
5489,1CO,9,NRSV,to those outside the law i became as one outside the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so that i might win those outside the law,there he became the father of two sons,1,1CO.9
5490,1CO,9,NRSV,to the weak i became weak so that i might win the weak,after agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard,1,1CO.9
5491,1CO,9,NRSV,i have become all things to all people that i might by all means save some,as he was going down his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive,1,1CO.9
5492,1CO,9,NRSV,i do it all for the sake of the gospel so that i may share in its blessings,and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband,1,1CO.9
5493,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that in a race the runners all compete but only one receives the prize,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask,1,1CO.9
5494,1CO,9,NRSV,run in such a way that you may win it,or does he not speak entirely for our sake,1,1CO.9
5495,1CO,9,NRSV,athletes exercise selfcontrol in all things they do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an imperishable one,but jesus said to them because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you,1,1CO.9
5496,1CO,9,NRSV,so i do not run aimlessly nor do i box as though beating the air but i punish my body and enslave it so that after proclaiming to others i myself should not be disqualified,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look,1,1CO.9
5594,1CO,13,NRSV,if i speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels but do not have love i am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal,the disciples said to him where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd,1,1CO.13
5595,1CO,13,NRSV,and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love i am nothing,for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many,1,1CO.13
5596,1CO,13,NRSV,if i give away all my possessions and if i hand over my body so that i may boast but do not have love i gain nothing,instead strive for his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well,1,1CO.13
5597,1CO,13,NRSV,love is patient love is kind love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude,but do not ignore this one fact beloved that with the lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day,1,1CO.13
5598,1CO,13,NRSV,it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice in wrongdoing but rejoices in the truth,then jesus cried aloud whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me,1,1CO.13
5599,1CO,13,NRSV,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him,1,1CO.13
5600,1CO,13,NRSV,but as for prophecies they will come to an end as for tongues they will cease as for knowledge it will come to an end,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married,1,1CO.13
5601,1CO,13,NRSV,for we know only in part and we prophesy only in part but when the complete comes the partial will come to an end,for if god did not spare the natural branches perhaps he will not spare you,1,1CO.13
5602,1CO,13,NRSV,when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put an end to childish ways,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself,1,1CO.13
5603,1CO,13,NRSV,for now we see in a mirror dimly but then we will see face to face,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith the lord replied if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you,1,1CO.13
5604,1CO,13,NRSV,now i know only in part then i will know fully even as i have been fully known,when he had removed him he made david their king,1,1CO.13
5605,1CO,13,NRSV,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate,1,1CO.13
5650,1CO,15,NRSV,now i would remind you brothers and sisters of the good news that i proclaimed to you which you in turn received in which also you stand through which also you are being saved if you hold firmly to the message that i proclaimed to youunless you have come to believe in vain,and we will do this if god permits,1,1CO.15
5651,1CO,15,NRSV,for i handed on to you as of first importance what i in turn had received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve, then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength,1,1CO.15
5652,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did,1,1CO.15
5653,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to james then to all the apostles,they were allowed to torture them for five months but not to kill them and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone,1,1CO.15
5654,1CO,15,NRSV,last of all as to one untimely born he appeared also to me,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living,1,1CO.15
5655,1CO,15,NRSV,for i am the least of the apostles unfit to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day,1,1CO.15
5656,1CO,15,NRSV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me has not been in vain,but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days,1,1CO.15
5657,1CO,15,NRSV,on the contrary i worked harder than any of themthough it was not i but the grace of god that is with me,drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman,1,1CO.15
5658,1CO,15,NRSV,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe,now brothers and sisters if i come to you speaking in tongues how will i benefit you unless i speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching,1,1CO.15
5659,1CO,15,NRSV,now if christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound had been healed,1,1CO.15
5660,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain,jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband,1,1CO.15
5661,1CO,15,NRSV,we are even found to be misrepresenting god because we testified of god that he raised christwhom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised,for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification,1,1CO.15
5662,1CO,15,NRSV,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified,1,1CO.15
5663,1CO,15,NRSV,if christ has not been raised your faith is futile and you are still in your sins,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation,1,1CO.15
5664,1CO,15,NRSV,then those also who have died in christ have perished,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep,1,1CO.15
5665,1CO,15,NRSV,if for this life only we have hoped in christ we are of all people most to be pitied,when his disciples james and john saw it they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them,1,1CO.15
5666,1CO,15,NRSV,but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have died,at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples were hungry and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat,1,1CO.15
5667,1CO,15,NRSV,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ,where then did these weeds come from,1,1CO.15
5668,1CO,15,NRSV,but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at his coming those who belong to christ,so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him because he was going to pass that way,1,1CO.15
5669,1CO,15,NRSV,then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds,1,1CO.15
5670,1CO,15,NRSV,for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven,1,1CO.15
5671,1CO,15,NRSV,the last enemy to be destroyed is death,jesus said i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind,1,1CO.15
5672,1CO,15,NRSV,for god has put all things in subjection under his feet,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1,1CO.15
5673,1CO,15,NRSV,but when it says all things are put in subjection it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him,but i say to you do not resist an evildoer,1,1CO.15
5674,1CO,15,NRSV,when all things are subjected to him then the son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him so that god may be all in all,after that he must be let out for a little while,1,1CO.15
5675,1CO,15,NRSV,otherwise what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it,1,1CO.15
5676,1CO,15,NRSV,if the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized on their behalf,then they asked him where lord,1,1CO.15
5677,1CO,15,NRSV,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour,now herod the ruler heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen,1,1CO.15
5678,1CO,15,NRSV,i die every day that is as certain brothers and sisters as my boasting of youa boast that i make in christ jesus our lord,but the wise replied no there will not be enough for you and for us you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves,1,1CO.15
5679,1CO,15,NRSV,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it,and the fact that the dead are raised moses himself showed in the story about the bush where he speaks of the lord as the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob,1,1CO.15
5680,1CO,15,NRSV,if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die,and jesus answered him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven,1,1CO.15
5681,1CO,15,NRSV,do not be deceived bad company ruins good morals,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory,1,1CO.15
5682,1CO,15,NRSV,come to a sober and right mind and sin no more for some people have no knowledge of god,the friends who are with me greet you,1,1CO.15
5683,1CO,15,NRSV,i say this to your shame,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did,1,1CO.15
5684,1CO,15,NRSV,but someone will ask how are the dead raised,you are aware that all who are in asia have turned away from me including phygelus and hermogenes,1,1CO.15
5685,1CO,15,NRSV,with what kind of body do they come,david thus calls him lord so how can he be his son,1,1CO.15
5686,1CO,15,NRSV,fool what you sow does not come to life unless it dies,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life,1,1CO.15
5687,1CO,15,NRSV,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain,and pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother,1,1CO.15
5688,1CO,15,NRSV,but god gives it a body as he has chosen and to each kind of seed its own body,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus,1,1CO.15
5689,1CO,15,NRSV,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish,i left you behind in crete for this reason so that you should put in order what remained to be done and should appoint elders in every town as i directed you someone who is blameless married only once whose children are believers not accused of debauchery and not rebellious,1,1CO.15
5690,1CO,15,NRSV,there are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one thing and that of the earthly is another,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy,1,1CO.15
5691,1CO,15,NRSV,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory,those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered,1,1CO.15
5692,1CO,15,NRSV,so it is with the resurrection of the dead,and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all,1,1CO.15
5693,1CO,15,NRSV,what is sown is perishable what is raised is imperishable,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor,1,1CO.15
5694,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory,you are indeed doing what your father does,1,1CO.15
5695,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in weakness it is raised in power,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead,1,1CO.15
5696,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown a physical body it is raised a spiritual body,beloved if our hearts do not condemn us we have boldness before god and we receive from him whatever we ask because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him,1,1CO.15
5697,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is a physical body there is also a spiritual body,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also and jason has entertained them as guests,1,1CO.15
5698,1CO,15,NRSV,thus it is written the first man adam became a living being the last adam became a lifegiving spirit,as to his raising him from the dead no more to return to corruption he has spoken in this way i will give you the holy promises made to david,1,1CO.15
5699,1CO,15,NRSV,but it is not the spiritual that is first but the physical and then the spiritual,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished,1,1CO.15
5700,1CO,15,NRSV,the first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is from heaven,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down,1,1CO.15
5701,1CO,15,NRSV,as was the man of dust so are those who are of the dust and as is the man of heaven so are those who are of heaven,but i tell you on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you,1,1CO.15
5702,1CO,15,NRSV,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven,but if i do them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i am in the father,1,1CO.15
5703,1CO,15,NRSV,what i am saying brothers and sisters is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away,1,1CO.15
5704,1CO,15,NRSV,listen i will tell you a mystery we will not all die but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee,1,1CO.15
5705,1CO,15,NRSV,for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed,three times i was shipwrecked for a night and a day i was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from bandits danger from my own people danger from gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers and sisters in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night hungry and thirsty often without food cold and naked,1,1CO.15
5706,1CO,15,NRSV,for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him,1,1CO.15
5707,1CO,15,NRSV,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory,every day he was teaching in the temple and at night he would go out and spend the night on the mount of olives as it was called,1,1CO.15
5708,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your victory,day after day i sat in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me,1,1CO.15
5709,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your sting,how is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart,1,1CO.15
5710,1CO,15,NRSV,the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed,1,1CO.15
5711,1CO,15,NRSV,but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,1,1CO.15
5712,1CO,15,NRSV,therefore my beloved be steadfast immovable always excelling in the work of the lord because you know that in the lord your labor is not in vain,nothing accursed will be found there any more,1,1CO.15
5756,2CO,2,NRSV,so i made up my mind not to make you another painful visit,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go,1,2CO.2
5757,2CO,2,NRSV,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,1,2CO.2
5758,2CO,2,NRSV,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you,what deeds of power are being done by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us,1,2CO.2
5759,2CO,2,NRSV,for i wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that i have for you,he intended to pass them by,1,2CO.2
5760,2CO,2,NRSV,but if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but to some extentnot to exaggerate itto all of you,and there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds,1,2CO.2
5761,2CO,2,NRSV,this punishment by the majority is enough for such a person so now instead you should forgive and console him so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow,and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith,1,2CO.2
5762,2CO,2,NRSV,so i urge you to reaffirm your love for him,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism,1,2CO.2
5763,2CO,2,NRSV,i wrote for this reason to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything,they put him to death by hanging him on a tree but god raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear not to all the people but to us who were chosen by god as witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead,1,2CO.2
5764,2CO,2,NRSV,anyone whom you forgive i also forgive,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house,1,2CO.2
5765,2CO,2,NRSV,what i have forgiven if i have forgiven anything has been for your sake in the presence of christ,so they took the money and did as they were directed,1,2CO.2
5766,2CO,2,NRSV,and we do this so that we may not be outwitted by satan for we are not ignorant of his designs,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right,1,2CO.2
5767,2CO,2,NRSV,when i came to troas to proclaim the good news of christ a door was opened for me in the lord but my mind could not rest because i did not find my brother titus there,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me,1,2CO.2
5768,2CO,2,NRSV,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,but truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god,1,2CO.2
5769,2CO,2,NRSV,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings,1,2CO.2
5770,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are the aroma of christ to god among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing to the one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life,and all ate and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish,1,2CO.2
5771,2CO,2,NRSV,who is sufficient for these things,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you,1,2CO.2
5772,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are not peddlers of gods word like so many but in christ we speak as persons of sincerity as persons sent from god and standing in his presence,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before,1,2CO.2
5773,2CO,3,NRSV,are we beginning to commend ourselves again,do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world,1,2CO.3
5774,2CO,3,NRSV,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you,1,2CO.3
5775,2CO,3,NRSV,you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts to be known and read by all and you show that you are a letter of christ prepared by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,1,2CO.3
5776,2CO,3,NRSV,such is the confidence that we have through christ toward god,rejoice then you heavens and those who dwell in them but woe to the earth and the sea for the devil has come down to you with great wrath because he knows that his time is short so when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child,1,2CO.3
5777,2CO,3,NRSV,not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us our competence is from god who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not of letter but of spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds he also adds i will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more,1,2CO.3
5778,2CO,3,NRSV,now if the ministry of death chiseled in letters on stone tablets came in glory so that the people of israel could not gaze at moses face because of the glory of his face a glory now set aside how much more will the ministry of the spirit come in glory,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people,1,2CO.3
5779,2CO,3,NRSV,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets,1,2CO.3
5780,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day when they hear the reading of the old covenant that same veil is still there since only in christ is it set aside,beloved do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good,1,2CO.3
5781,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed,let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of god and the teaching may not be blasphemed,1,2CO.3
5782,2CO,3,NRSV,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom,when he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor he told them a parable,1,2CO.3
5783,2CO,3,NRSV,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit,on the first day of every week each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn so that collections need not be taken when i come,1,2CO.3
5799,2CO,5,NRSV,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity,1,2CO.5
5800,2CO,5,NRSV,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus,1,2CO.5
5801,2CO,5,NRSV,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life,then they said what further testimony do we need,1,2CO.5
5802,2CO,5,NRSV,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee,the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each one to his home and you will leave me alone,1,2CO.5
5803,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness,1,2CO.5
5804,2CO,5,NRSV,yes we do have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord,when paul had been summoned tertullus began to accuse him saying your excellency because of you we have long enjoyed peace and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight,1,2CO.5
5805,2CO,5,NRSV,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,and he called them to him and spoke to them in parables how can satan cast out satan,1,2CO.5
5806,2CO,5,NRSV,for all of us must appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body whether good or evil,on one occasion when jesus was going to the house of a leader of the pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath they were watching him closely,1,2CO.5
5807,2CO,5,NRSV,therefore knowing the fear of the lord we try to persuade others but we ourselves are well known to god and i hope that we are also well known to your consciences,he said to them but who do you say that i am,1,2CO.5
5808,2CO,5,NRSV,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death,1,2CO.5
5809,2CO,5,NRSV,for if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right mind it is for you,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us,1,2CO.5
5810,2CO,5,NRSV,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment,1,2CO.5
5811,2CO,5,NRSV,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them,in the morning when he returned to the city he was hungry,1,2CO.5
5812,2CO,5,NRSV,from now on therefore we regard no one from a human point of view even though we once knew christ from a human point of view we know him no longer in that way,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him,1,2CO.5
5813,2CO,5,NRSV,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover,1,2CO.5
5814,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god,the elder to the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not only i but also all who know the truth because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the fathers son in truth and love,1,2CO.5
5815,2CO,5,NRSV,for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement,1,2CO.5
5831,2CO,7,NRSV,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans,1,2CO.7
5832,2CO,7,NRSV,make room in your hearts for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love,1,2CO.7
5833,2CO,7,NRSV,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together,he said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at capernaum,1,2CO.7
5834,2CO,7,NRSV,i often boast about you i have great pride in you i am filled with consolation i am overjoyed in all our affliction,in our prayers for you we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ for we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints because of the hope laid up for you in heaven,1,2CO.7
5835,2CO,7,NRSV,for even when we came into macedonia our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted in every waydisputes without and fears within,why do you not understand what i say,1,2CO.7
5836,2CO,7,NRSV,but god who consoles the downcast consoled us by the arrival of titus and not only by his coming but also by the consolation with which he was consoled about you as he told us of your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that i rejoiced still more,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,1,2CO.7
5837,2CO,7,NRSV,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard,1,2CO.7
5838,2CO,7,NRSV,now i rejoice not because you were grieved but because your grief led to repentance for you felt a godly grief so that you were not harmed in any way by us,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me,1,2CO.7
5839,2CO,7,NRSV,for godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret but worldly grief produces death,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast,1,2CO.7
5840,2CO,7,NRSV,for see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what zeal what punishment at every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter,jesus said to her your brother will rise again,1,2CO.7
5841,2CO,7,NRSV,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god,for three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth,1,2CO.7
5842,2CO,7,NRSV,in addition to our own consolation we rejoiced still more at the joy of titus because his mind has been set at rest by all of you,listen the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you kept back by fraud cry out and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts,1,2CO.7
5843,2CO,7,NRSV,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well,let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision,1,2CO.7
5844,2CO,7,NRSV,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat,1,2CO.7
5845,2CO,7,NRSV,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you,when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god,1,2CO.7
6113,EPH,2,NRSV,you were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived following the course of this world following the ruler of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod had married her,1,EPH.2
6114,EPH,2,NRSV,all of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh following the desires of flesh and senses and we were by nature children of wrath like everyone else,so i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may dwell in me,1,EPH.2
6115,EPH,2,NRSV,but god who is rich in mercy out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him,1,EPH.2
6116,EPH,2,NRSV,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast,they came to jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind the very man who had had the legion and they were afraid,1,EPH.2
6117,EPH,2,NRSV,for we are what he has made us created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand to be our way of life,then paul answered what are you doing weeping and breaking my heart,1,EPH.2
6118,EPH,2,NRSV,so then remember that at one time you gentiles by birth called the uncircumcision by those who are called the circumcisiona physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands remember that you were at that time without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers to the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love,1,EPH.2
6119,EPH,2,NRSV,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb,1,EPH.2
6120,EPH,2,NRSV,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us,he had come to jerusalem to worship and was returning home seated in his chariot he was reading the prophet isaiah,1,EPH.2
6121,EPH,2,NRSV,he has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two thus making peace and might reconcile both groups to god in one body through the cross thus putting to death that hostility through it,and we are ready to do away with him before he arrives,1,EPH.2
6122,EPH,2,NRSV,so he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near for through him both of us have access in one spirit to the father,for it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things and your father knows that you need them,1,EPH.2
6123,EPH,2,NRSV,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me,1,EPH.2
6124,EPH,2,NRSV,in him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for god,after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them,1,EPH.2
6135,EPH,4,NRSV,i therefore the prisoner in the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,do you not know that i have power to release you and power to crucify you,1,EPH.4
6136,EPH,4,NRSV,there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in all,slaves obey your earthly masters in everything not only while being watched and in order to please them but wholeheartedly fearing the lord,1,EPH.4
6137,EPH,4,NRSV,but each of us was given grace according to the measure of christs gift,when he entered capernaum a centurion came to him appealing to him and saying lord my servant is lying at home paralyzed in terrible distress,1,EPH.4
6138,EPH,4,NRSV,therefore it is said when he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive he gave gifts to his people,any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head disgraces his head but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved,1,EPH.4
6139,EPH,4,NRSV,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth,in damascus the governor under king aretas guarded the city of damascus in order to seize me but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands,1,EPH.4
6140,EPH,4,NRSV,he who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things the gifts he gave were that some would be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of christ until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to maturity to the measure of the full stature of christ,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory,1,EPH.4
6141,EPH,4,NRSV,we must no longer be children tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine by peoples trickery by their craftiness in deceitful scheming,he stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him,1,EPH.4
6142,EPH,4,NRSV,but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ from whom the whole body joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped as each part is working properly promotes the bodys growth in building itself up in love,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,1,EPH.4
6143,EPH,4,NRSV,now this i affirm and insist on in the lord you must no longer live as the gentiles live in the futility of their minds,no one is good but god alone,1,EPH.4
6144,EPH,4,NRSV,they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of their ignorance and hardness of heart,then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly my little daughter is at the point of death,1,EPH.4
6145,EPH,4,NRSV,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us,1,EPH.4
6146,EPH,4,NRSV,that is not the way you learned christ for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus,yes and i will continue to rejoice for i know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ this will turn out for my deliverance,1,EPH.4
6147,EPH,4,NRSV,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught,1,EPH.4
6148,EPH,4,NRSV,so then putting away falsehood let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors for we are members of one another,it was one of them their very own prophet who said cretans are always liars vicious brutes lazy gluttons,1,EPH.4
6149,EPH,4,NRSV,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil,and so it was that all were brought safely to land,1,EPH.4
6150,EPH,4,NRSV,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy,so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty,1,EPH.4
6151,EPH,4,NRSV,let no evil talk come out of your mouths but only what is useful for building up as there is need so that your words may give grace to those who hear,i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me,1,EPH.4
6152,EPH,4,NRSV,and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption,over these the second death has no power but they will be priests of god and of christ and they will reign with him a thousand years,1,EPH.4

6243,PHP,3,NRSV,finally my brothers and sisters rejoice in the lord,for he had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit then jesus asked him what is your name,1,PHP.3
6244,PHP,3,NRSV,to write the same things to you is not troublesome to me and for you it is a safeguard,this took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion look your king is coming to you humble and mounted on a donkey and on a colt the foal of a donkey,1,PHP.3
6245,PHP,3,NRSV,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right,1,PHP.3
6246,PHP,3,NRSV,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,jesus said to them fill the jars with water,1,PHP.3
6247,PHP,3,NRSV,yet whatever gains i had these i have come to regard as loss because of christ,but only speak the word and let my servant be healed,1,PHP.3
6248,PHP,3,NRSV,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord,1,PHP.3
6249,PHP,3,NRSV,for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and i regard them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but one that comes through faith in christ the righteousness from god based on faith,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you,1,PHP.3
6250,PHP,3,NRSV,i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not,1,PHP.3

6252,PHP,3,NRSV,beloved i do not consider that i have made it my own but this one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead i press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of god in christ jesus,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches,1,PHP.3
6253,PHP,3,NRSV,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews,1,PHP.3

6256,PHP,3,NRSV,for many live as enemies of the cross of christ i have often told you of them and now i tell you even with tears,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god,1,PHP.3
6257,PHP,3,NRSV,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling,1,PHP.3
6258,PHP,3,NRSV,but our citizenship is in heaven and it is from there that we are expecting a savior the lord jesus christ,he was a devout man who feared god with all his household he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to god,1,PHP.3
6259,PHP,3,NRSV,he will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist,1,PHP.3
6323,COL,3,NRSV,so if you have been raised with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words,1,COL.3
6324,COL,3,NRSV,set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god,it was fitting that god for whom and through whom all things exist in bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings,1,COL.3
6325,COL,3,NRSV,when christ who is your life is revealed then you also will be revealed with him in glory,you have been born anew not of perishable but of imperishable seed through the living and enduring word of god,1,COL.3

6328,COL,3,NRSV,these are the ways you also once followed when you were living that life,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer,1,COL.3
6329,COL,3,NRSV,but now you must get rid of all such thingsanger wrath malice slander and abusive language from your mouth,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another,1,COL.3
6330,COL,3,NRSV,do not lie to one another seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator,but he was speaking of the temple of his body,1,COL.3

6332,COL,3,NRSV,bear with one another and if anyone has a complaint against another forgive each other just as the lord has forgiven you so you also must forgive,from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain,1,COL.3

6338,COL,3,NRSV,husbands love your wives and never treat them harshly,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain,1,COL.3
6339,COL,3,NRSV,children obey your parents in everything for this is your acceptable duty in the lord,then another angel a second followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,1,COL.3

6364,1TH,1,NRSV,we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ,i tell you among those born of women no one is greater than john yet the least in the kingdom of god is greater than he,1,1TH.1
6365,1TH,1,NRSV,for we know brothers and sisters beloved by god that he has chosen you because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake,greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss,1,1TH.1
6366,1TH,1,NRSV,and you became imitators of us and of the lord for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the holy spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia,they replied the things about jesus of nazareth who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him,1,1TH.1
6367,1TH,1,NRSV,for the word of the lord has sounded forth from you not only in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith in god has become known so that we have no need to speak about it,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish,1,1TH.1
6368,1TH,1,NRSV,for the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you and how you turned to god from idols to serve a living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the deadjesus who rescues us from the wrath that is coming,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham,1,1TH.1
6582,2TI,3,NRSV,you must understand this that in the last days distressing times will come,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,1,2TI.3
6583,2TI,3,NRSV,for people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boasters arrogant abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy inhuman implacable slanderers profligates brutes haters of good treacherous reckless swollen with conceit lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power,immediately he regained his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it praised god,1,2TI.3
6584,2TI,3,NRSV,avoid them for among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth,being therefore exalted at the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured out this that you both see and hear,1,2TI.3
6585,2TI,3,NRSV,as jannes and jambres opposed moses so these people of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith also oppose the truth,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven,1,2TI.3
6586,2TI,3,NRSV,but they will not make much progress because as in the case of those two men their folly will become plain to everyone,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him,1,2TI.3
6587,2TI,3,NRSV,now you have observed my teaching my conduct my aim in life my faith my patience my love my steadfastness my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in antioch iconium and lystra,i think it right as long as i am in this body to refresh your memory since i know that my death will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me,1,2TI.3
6588,2TI,3,NRSV,what persecutions i endured yet the lord rescued me from all of them,look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces,1,2TI.3
6589,2TI,3,NRSV,indeed all who want to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts,1,2TI.3
6590,2TI,3,NRSV,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves,1,2TI.3
6591,2TI,3,NRSV,but as for you continue in what you have learned and firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in christ jesus,and are not all his sisters with us,1,2TI.3
6592,2TI,3,NRSV,all scripture is inspired by god and is useful for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness so that everyone who belongs to god may be proficient equipped for every good work,philip said to him come and see,1,2TI.3
6681,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it,i do not even judge myself,1,HEB.2
6682,HEB,2,NRSV,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him,1,HEB.2
6683,HEB,2,NRSV,it was declared at first through the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard him while god added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village,1,HEB.2
6684,HEB,2,NRSV,now god did not subject the coming world about which we are speaking to angels,fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses,1,HEB.2
6685,HEB,2,NRSV,but someone has testified somewhere what are human beings that you are mindful of them or mortals that you care for them,pilate asked him so you are a king,1,HEB.2
6686,HEB,2,NRSV,you have made them for a little while lower than the angels you have crowned them with glory and honor subjecting all things under their feet,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach,1,HEB.2
6687,HEB,2,NRSV,now in subjecting all things to them god left nothing outside their control,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe,1,HEB.2
6688,HEB,2,NRSV,as it is we do not yet see everything in subjection to them but we do see jesus who for a little while was made lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of god he might taste death for everyone,and we urge you beloved to admonish the idlers encourage the faint hearted help the weak be patient with all of them,1,HEB.2
6689,HEB,2,NRSV,it was fitting that god for whom and through whom all things exist in bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him,1,HEB.2
6690,HEB,2,NRSV,for the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one father,you have never heard his voice or seen his form and you do not have his word abiding in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent,1,HEB.2
6691,HEB,2,NRSV,for this reason jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters saying i will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters in the midst of the congregation i will praise you,but striking a reef they ran the ship aground the bow stuck and remained immovable but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves,1,HEB.2
6692,HEB,2,NRSV,and again i will put my trust in him,but he answered it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god,1,HEB.2
6693,HEB,2,NRSV,and again here am i and the children whom god has given me,for it is the gentiles who strive for all these things and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things,1,HEB.2
6694,HEB,2,NRSV,since therefore the children share flesh and blood he himself likewise shared the same things so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death,then they went on to another village,1,HEB.2
6695,HEB,2,NRSV,for it is clear that he did not come to help angels but the descendants of abraham,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea,1,HEB.2
6696,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of god to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people,he called out with a mighty voice fallen fallen is babylon the great it has become a dwelling place of demons a haunt of every foul spirit a haunt of every foul bird a haunt of every foul and hateful beast,1,HEB.2
6697,HEB,2,NRSV,because he himself was tested by what he suffered he is able to help those who are being tested,again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it,1,HEB.2
6900,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus,1,HEB.13
6901,HEB,13,NRSV,remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with them those who are being tortured as though you yourselves were being tortured,but he said to them unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe,1,HEB.13
6902,HEB,13,NRSV,let marriage be held in honor by all and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled for god will judge fornicators and adulterers,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless,1,HEB.13
6903,HEB,13,NRSV,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you,i wish that you were either cold or hot,1,HEB.13
6904,HEB,13,NRSV,so we can say with confidence the lord is my helper i will not be afraid,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia,1,HEB.13
6905,HEB,13,NRSV,what can anyone do to me,they said to him rabbi which translated means teacher where are you staying,1,HEB.13
6906,HEB,13,NRSV,remember your leaders those who spoke the word of god to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith,they went to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i pray,1,HEB.13
6907,HEB,13,NRSV,jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever,for so the lord has commanded us saying i have set you to be a light for the gentiles so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth,1,HEB.13
6908,HEB,13,NRSV,do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings for it is well for the heart to be strengthened by grace not by regulations about food which have not benefited those who observe them,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews,1,HEB.13
6909,HEB,13,NRSV,we have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right to eat,as he went a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john who were in their boat mending the nets,1,HEB.13
6910,HEB,13,NRSV,for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest,1,HEB.13
6911,HEB,13,NRSV,therefore jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood,those who conducted paul brought him as far as athens and after receiving instructions to have silas and timothy join him as soon as possible they left him,1,HEB.13
6912,HEB,13,NRSV,let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured,god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins,1,HEB.13
6913,HEB,13,NRSV,for here we have no lasting city but we are looking for the city that is to come,while he was still speaking someone came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer,1,HEB.13
6914,HEB,13,NRSV,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name,and when this letter has been read among you have it read also in the church of the laodiceans and see that you read also the letter from laodicea,1,HEB.13
6915,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to god,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus,1,HEB.13
6916,HEB,13,NRSV,obey your leaders and submit to them for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account,at that time herod the ruler heard reports about jesus and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him,1,HEB.13
6917,HEB,13,NRSV,let them do this with joy and not with sighingfor that would be harmful to you,when he had entered the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast it out,1,HEB.13
6918,HEB,13,NRSV,pray for us we are sure that we have a clear conscience desiring to act honorably in all things,they were all weeping and wailing for her but he said do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping,1,HEB.13
6919,HEB,13,NRSV,i urge you all the more to do this so that i may be restored to you very soon,and those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires,1,HEB.13
6920,HEB,13,NRSV,now may the god of peace who brought back from the dead our lord jesus the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of the eternal covenant make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will working among us that which is pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever and ever,and when they received it they grumbled against the landowner saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat,1,HEB.13
6921,HEB,13,NRSV,i appeal to you brothers and sisters bear with my word of exhortation for i have written to you briefly,the angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls,1,HEB.13
6922,HEB,13,NRSV,i want you to know that our brother timothy has been set free and if he comes in time he will be with me when i see you,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me,1,HEB.13
6923,HEB,13,NRSV,greet all your leaders and all the saints,and jesus who is called justus greets you,1,HEB.13
6924,HEB,13,NRSV,those from italy send you greetings,but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes only in the lord,1,HEB.13
6925,HEB,13,NRSV,grace be with all of you,so he went in and out among them in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord,1,HEB.13
7191,1JN,1,NRSV,we declare to you what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life this life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it and declare to you the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ,thanks be to god for his indescribable gift,1,1JN.1
7192,1JN,1,NRSV,we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete,who are you to pass judgment on servants of another,1,1JN.1
7193,1JN,1,NRSV,this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all,then if anyone says to you look here is the messiah or there he isdo not believe it,1,1JN.1
7194,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves,1,1JN.1

7314,2JN,1,NRSV,but now dear lady i ask you not as though i were writing you a new commandment but one we have had from the beginning let us love one another,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from,1,2JN.1

7364,REV,1,NRSV,then i turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me and on turning i saw seven golden lampstands and in the midst of the lampstands i saw one like the son of man clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest,the jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true,1,REV.1
7365,REV,1,NRSV,his head and his hair were white as white wool white as snow his eyes were like a flame of fire his feet were like burnished bronze refined as in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of many waters,but they all alike began to make excuses,1,REV.1

7369,REV,1,NRSV,i was dead and see i am alive forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of hades,so he set off and went to his father,1,REV.1

7371,REV,1,NRSV,as for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches,for he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in christ but of suffering for him as well since you are having the same struggle that you saw i had and now hear that i still have,1,REV.1
7431,REV,4,NRSV,after this i looked and there in heaven a door stood open and the first voice which i had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said come up here and i will show you what must take place after this,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection,1,REV.4
7432,REV,4,NRSV,at once i was in the spirit and there in heaven stood a throne with one seated on the throne and the one seated there looks like jasper and carnelian and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald,he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury,1,REV.4
7433,REV,4,NRSV,around the throne are twentyfour thrones and seated on the thrones are twentyfour elders dressed in white robes with golden crowns on their heads,i thank my god every time i remember you constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now,1,REV.4
7434,REV,4,NRSV,coming from the throne are flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches which are the seven spirits of god and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass like crystal,jesus said i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind,1,REV.4
7435,REV,4,NRSV,around the throne and on each side of the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind the first living creature like a lion the second living creature like an ox the third living creature with a face like a human face and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle,do your best to come before winter,1,REV.4
7436,REV,4,NRSV,and the four living creatures each of them with six wings are full of eyes all around and inside,but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him,1,REV.4
7437,REV,4,NRSV,day and night without ceasing they sing holy holy holy the lord god the almighty who was and is and is to come,show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom,1,REV.4
7438,REV,4,NRSV,and whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne who lives forever and ever the twentyfour elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever they cast their crowns before the throne singing you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they existed and were created,for if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say have a seat here please while to the one who is poor you say stand there or sit at my feet have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts,1,REV.4
7439,REV,5,NRSV,then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back sealed with seven seals and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it,1,REV.5
7440,REV,5,NRSV,and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans,1,REV.5
7441,REV,5,NRSV,and i began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it,so faith by itself if it has no works is dead,1,REV.5
7442,REV,5,NRSV,then one of the elders said to me do not weep,now john wore clothing of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and his food was locusts and wild honey,1,REV.5
7443,REV,5,NRSV,see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals,they are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor saying that there is another king named jesus,1,REV.5
7444,REV,5,NRSV,then i saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth,those who are ashamed of me and of my words of them the son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels,1,REV.5
7445,REV,5,NRSV,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,and the angels who did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day,1,REV.5
7446,REV,5,NRSV,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think,1,REV.5
7447,REV,5,NRSV,they sing a new song you are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for god saints from every tribe and language and people and nation you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our god and they will reign on earth,now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him,1,REV.5
7448,REV,5,NRSV,then i looked and i heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands singing with full voice worthy is the lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them singing to the one seated on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped,but immediately jesus spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid,1,REV.5
7499,REV,10,NRSV,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire,and in the spirit he carried me away to a great high mountain and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god,1,REV.10
7500,REV,10,NRSV,he held a little scroll open in his hand,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,1,REV.10
7501,REV,10,NRSV,setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land he gave a great shout like a lion roaring,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank,1,REV.10
7502,REV,10,NRSV,and when he shouted the seven thunders sounded,the young man said to him i have kept all these what do i still lack,1,REV.10
7503,REV,10,NRSV,and when the seven thunders had sounded i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down,as he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving jericho bartimaeus son of timaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside,1,REV.10
7504,REV,10,NRSV,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants the prophets,if any believing woman has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows,1,REV.10
7505,REV,10,NRSV,then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,1,REV.10
7506,REV,10,NRSV,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth,woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not enter yourselves and you hindered those who were entering,1,REV.10
7507,REV,10,NRSV,so i took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it it was sweet as honey in my mouth but when i had eaten it my stomach was made bitter,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,1,REV.10
7508,REV,10,NRSV,then they said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings,when the disciples reached the other side they had forgotten to bring any bread,1,REV.10
7542,REV,13,NRSV,and i saw a beast rising out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on its horns were ten diadems and on its heads were blasphemous names,he said to them where is your faith,1,REV.13
7543,REV,13,NRSV,and the beast that i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears and its mouth was like a lions mouth,i know what it is to have little and i know what it is to have plenty,1,REV.13
7544,REV,13,NRSV,and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority,they appealed to him and requested as a favor to them against paul to have him transferred to jerusalem,1,REV.13
7545,REV,13,NRSV,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound had been healed,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors,1,REV.13
7546,REV,13,NRSV,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast,as he went the crowds pressed in on him,1,REV.13
7547,REV,13,NRSV,they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it,if we receive human testimony the testimony of god is greater for this is the testimony of god that he has testified to his son,1,REV.13
7548,REV,13,NRSV,the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for fortytwo months,and he said to them how many loaves have you,1,REV.13
7549,REV,13,NRSV,it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his dwelling that is those who dwell in heaven,by faith abel offered to god a more acceptable sacrifice than cains,1,REV.13
7550,REV,13,NRSV,also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them,for god has put all things in subjection under his feet,1,REV.13
7551,REV,13,NRSV,it was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that was slaughtered,he kept saying i am the man,1,REV.13
7552,REV,13,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen if you are to be taken captive into captivity you go if you kill with the sword with the sword you must be killed,the lord be with all of you,1,REV.13
7553,REV,13,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his,1,REV.13
7554,REV,13,NRSV,then i saw another beast that rose out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon,thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him,1,REV.13
7555,REV,13,NRSV,it exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound had been healed,i wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness,1,REV.13
7556,REV,13,NRSV,it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast it deceives the inhabitants of earth telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed,in the presence of god who gives life to all things and of christ jesus who in his testimony before pontius pilate made the good confession i charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ which he will bring about at the right timehe who is the blessed and only sovereign the king of kings and lord of lords,1,REV.13
7557,REV,13,NRSV,also it causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price,1,REV.13
7558,REV,13,NRSV,this calls for wisdom let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a person,the dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven,1,REV.13
7559,REV,13,NRSV,its number is six hundred sixtysix,he himself died there as well as our ancestors and their bodies were brought back to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem,1,REV.13
7560,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him were one hundred fortyfour thousand who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god,1,REV.14
7561,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder the voice i heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders,and after they had appointed elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had come to believe,1,REV.14
7562,REV,14,NRSV,no one could learn that song except the one hundred fortyfour thousand who have been redeemed from the earth,and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth,1,REV.14
7563,REV,14,NRSV,it is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are virgins these follow the lamb wherever he goes,woe to you who are full now for you will be hungry,1,REV.14
7564,REV,14,NRSV,they have been redeemed from humankind as first fruits for god and the lamb and in their mouth no lie was found they are blameless,you cannot partake of the table of the lord and the table of demons,1,REV.14
7565,REV,14,NRSV,then i saw another angel flying in midheaven with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earthto every nation and tribe and language and people,and as he sat at dinner in the house many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples,1,REV.14
7566,REV,14,NRSV,he said in a loud voice fear god and give him glory for the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made heaven and earth the sea and the springs of water,so give for alms those things that are within and see everything will be clean for you,1,REV.14
7567,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a second followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer,1,REV.14
7568,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest,1,REV.14
7569,REV,14,NRSV,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever,do not become idolaters as some of them did as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play,1,REV.14
7570,REV,14,NRSV,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name,john said to him teacher we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he was not following us,1,REV.14
