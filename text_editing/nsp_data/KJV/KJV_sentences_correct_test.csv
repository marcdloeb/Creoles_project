5341,2CO,2,KJV,for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life,and who is sufficient for these things,0,2CO.2
5342,2CO,2,KJV,and who is sufficient for these things,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ,0,2CO.2
5343,2CO,2,KJV,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ,do we begin again to commend ourselves,0,2CO.2
5344,2CO,3,KJV,do we begin again to commend ourselves,or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you,0,2CO.3
5345,2CO,3,KJV,or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you,ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart,0,2CO.3
5346,2CO,3,KJV,ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart,and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life,0,2CO.3
5347,2CO,3,KJV,and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life,but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious,0,2CO.3
5348,2CO,3,KJV,but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious,for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory,0,2CO.3
5349,2CO,3,KJV,for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory,for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth,0,2CO.3
5350,2CO,3,KJV,for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth,for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,0,2CO.3
5351,2CO,3,KJV,for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ,0,2CO.3
5352,2CO,3,KJV,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ,but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart,0,2CO.3
5353,2CO,3,KJV,but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart,nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away,0,2CO.3
5354,2CO,3,KJV,nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty,0,2CO.3
5355,2CO,3,KJV,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,0,2CO.3
5356,2CO,3,KJV,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god,0,2CO.3
5369,2CO,5,KJV,for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked,0,2CO.5
5370,2CO,5,KJV,for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked,for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,0,2CO.5
5371,2CO,5,KJV,for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit,0,2CO.5
5372,2CO,5,KJV,now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit,therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord,0,2CO.5
5373,2CO,5,KJV,therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord,wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him,0,2CO.5
5374,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him,for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,0,2CO.5
5375,2CO,5,KJV,for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences,0,2CO.5
5376,2CO,5,KJV,knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences,for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart,0,2CO.5
5377,2CO,5,KJV,for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart,for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause,0,2CO.5
5378,2CO,5,KJV,for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause,for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again,0,2CO.5
5379,2CO,5,KJV,for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more,0,2CO.5
5380,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more,therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new,0,2CO.5
5381,2CO,5,KJV,therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new,and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,0,2CO.5
5382,2CO,5,KJV,and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god,0,2CO.5
5383,2CO,5,KJV,now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god,for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him,0,2CO.5
5384,2CO,5,KJV,for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him,we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain,0,2CO.5
5397,2CO,7,KJV,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man,0,2CO.7
5398,2CO,7,KJV,receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man,i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you ,0,2CO.7
5399,2CO,7,KJV,i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you ,great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation,0,2CO.7
5400,2CO,7,KJV,great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation,for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears,0,2CO.7
5401,2CO,7,KJV,for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears,nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more,0,2CO.7
5402,2CO,7,KJV,nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more,for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season,0,2CO.7
5403,2CO,7,KJV,for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season,now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing,0,2CO.7
5404,2CO,7,KJV,now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing,for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death,0,2CO.7
5405,2CO,7,KJV,for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death,for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter,0,2CO.7
5406,2CO,7,KJV,for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter,wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you,0,2CO.7
5407,2CO,7,KJV,wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you,therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all,0,2CO.7
5408,2CO,7,KJV,therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all,for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth,0,2CO.7
5409,2CO,7,KJV,for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth,and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him,0,2CO.7
