564,MAT,18,KJV,then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt,if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest,1,MAT.18
565,MAT,18,KJV,but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest,and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all,0,MAT.18
566,MAT,18,KJV,and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all,and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning,1,MAT.18
567,MAT,18,KJV,and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt,but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table,1,MAT.18
568,MAT,18,KJV,so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done,then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee,0,MAT.18
569,MAT,18,KJV,then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee,and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him,0,MAT.18
570,MAT,18,KJV,and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him,it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it,1,MAT.18
571,MAT,18,KJV,so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses,and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there,0,MAT.18

1092,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them know ye not this parable,but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they,1,MRK.4
1093,MRK,4,KJV,and how then will ye know all parables,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john,1,MRK.4
1094,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts,and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended,0,MRK.4
1095,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended,and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise,1,MRK.4

1097,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred,and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed,0,MRK.4
1098,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed,for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night,1,MRK.4

1108,MRK,4,KJV,or with what comparison shall we compare it,it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it,0,MRK.4
1109,MRK,4,KJV,it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it,and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it ,0,MRK.4
1110,MRK,4,KJV,and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it ,little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time,1,MRK.4
1111,MRK,4,KJV,but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples,and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side,0,MRK.4
1112,MRK,4,KJV,and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side,then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass,1,MRK.4

1167,MRK,6,KJV,and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things,and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands,0,MRK.6
1168,MRK,6,KJV,and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands,is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon,0,MRK.6
1169,MRK,6,KJV,is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon,and are not his sisters here with us,0,MRK.6

1171,MRK,6,KJV,and they were offended at him,wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do,1,MRK.6
1172,MRK,6,KJV,but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house,howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come,1,MRK.6
1173,MRK,6,KJV,and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them ,for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report,1,MRK.6
1174,MRK,6,KJV,and he marvelled because of their unbelief,and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him,1,MRK.6
1175,MRK,6,KJV,and he went round about the villages teaching,but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly,1,MRK.6

1180,MRK,6,KJV,and they went out and preached that men should repent,and cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends,1,MRK.6
1181,MRK,6,KJV,and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him,others said that it is elias,0,MRK.6
1182,MRK,6,KJV,others said that it is elias,and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets,0,MRK.6
1183,MRK,6,KJV,and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets,but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead,0,MRK.6
1184,MRK,6,KJV,but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead,for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her,0,MRK.6
1185,MRK,6,KJV,for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her,but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts,1,MRK.6
1186,MRK,6,KJV,for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife,and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews,1,MRK.6
1187,MRK,6,KJV,therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly,and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of galilee and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee,0,MRK.6
1188,MRK,6,KJV,and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of galilee and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee,and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed,1,MRK.6
1189,MRK,6,KJV,and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom,and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask,0,MRK.6
1190,MRK,6,KJV,and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask,and she said the head of john the baptist,0,MRK.6
1191,MRK,6,KJV,and she said the head of john the baptist,and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist,0,MRK.6
1192,MRK,6,KJV,and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist,and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men,1,MRK.6
1193,MRK,6,KJV,and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her,but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say,1,MRK.6
1194,MRK,6,KJV,and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother,and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb,0,MRK.6
1195,MRK,6,KJV,and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb,and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught,0,MRK.6
1196,MRK,6,KJV,and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught,and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,0,MRK.6
1197,MRK,6,KJV,and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god,1,MRK.6
1198,MRK,6,KJV,and they departed into a desert place by ship privately,and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him,0,MRK.6
1199,MRK,6,KJV,and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him,but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him,1,MRK.6
1200,MRK,6,KJV,and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things,of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand,1,MRK.6
1201,MRK,6,KJV,and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat,and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith,1,MRK.6
1202,MRK,6,KJV,he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat,and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat,0,MRK.6
1203,MRK,6,KJV,and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat,ye judge after the flesh i judge no man,1,MRK.6
1204,MRK,6,KJV,he saith unto them how many loaves have ye,and when they knew they say five and two fishes,0,MRK.6
1205,MRK,6,KJV,and when they knew they say five and two fishes,and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass,0,MRK.6
1206,MRK,6,KJV,and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass,and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties,0,MRK.6
1207,MRK,6,KJV,and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties,and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all,0,MRK.6
1208,MRK,6,KJV,and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all,and they did all eat and were filled,0,MRK.6
1209,MRK,6,KJV,and they did all eat and were filled,and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes,0,MRK.6
1210,MRK,6,KJV,and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes,and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men,0,MRK.6
1211,MRK,6,KJV,and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men,after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized,1,MRK.6
1212,MRK,6,KJV,and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people,but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat,1,MRK.6
1213,MRK,6,KJV,and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray,and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land,0,MRK.6
1214,MRK,6,KJV,and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land,and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them,0,MRK.6
1215,MRK,6,KJV,and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them,and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration,1,MRK.6
1216,MRK,6,KJV,but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled,and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,1,MRK.6
1217,MRK,6,KJV,and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid,and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered,0,MRK.6
1218,MRK,6,KJV,and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered,and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth,1,MRK.6
1219,MRK,6,KJV,for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened,and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him,1,MRK.6
1220,MRK,6,KJV,and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore,and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was,0,MRK.6
1221,MRK,6,KJV,and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was,and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name,1,MRK.6
1222,MRK,6,KJV,and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole,this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him,1,MRK.6
1422,MRK,12,KJV,and he began to speak unto them by parables,and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things,1,MRK.12
1423,MRK,12,KJV,a certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country,and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand,1,MRK.12
1424,MRK,12,KJV,and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard,and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace,1,MRK.12
1425,MRK,12,KJV,and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty,and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled,0,MRK.12
1426,MRK,12,KJV,and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled,for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life,1,MRK.12
1427,MRK,12,KJV,and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some,having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son,0,MRK.12

1432,MRK,12,KJV,he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others,and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,0,MRK.12
1433,MRK,12,KJV,and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee,1,MRK.12
1434,MRK,12,KJV,and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way,yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works,1,MRK.12
1435,MRK,12,KJV,and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words,and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light,1,MRK.12

1442,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods,then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,0,MRK.12
1443,MRK,12,KJV,then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed,0,MRK.12

1448,MRK,12,KJV,for the seven had her to wife,and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god,0,MRK.12
1449,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god,for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven,0,MRK.12
1450,MRK,12,KJV,for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven,and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,0,MRK.12
1451,MRK,12,KJV,and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable,1,MRK.12
1452,MRK,12,KJV,he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err,and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ,1,MRK.12
1453,MRK,12,KJV,and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all,and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment,0,MRK.12
1454,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment,and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,0,MRK.12

1458,MRK,12,KJV,and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god,and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people,1,MRK.12
1459,MRK,12,KJV,and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david,now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them,1,MRK.12
1460,MRK,12,KJV,for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in,1,MRK.12
1461,MRK,12,KJV,david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son,and the common people heard him gladly,0,MRK.12
1462,MRK,12,KJV,and the common people heard him gladly,and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in,1,MRK.12
1463,MRK,12,KJV,and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation,and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much,0,MRK.12

1465,MRK,12,KJV,and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing,and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him,1,MRK.12
1466,MRK,12,KJV,and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living,then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priests servant and cut off his right ear,1,MRK.12
1622,MRK,16,KJV,and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him,and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun,0,MRK.16
1623,MRK,16,KJV,and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun,and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation,1,MRK.16
1624,MRK,16,KJV,and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre,it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened,1,MRK.16
1625,MRK,16,KJV,and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great,verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down,1,MRK.16
1626,MRK,16,KJV,and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted,and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him,0,MRK.16
1627,MRK,16,KJV,and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him,but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you,0,MRK.16
1628,MRK,16,KJV,but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you,and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid,0,MRK.16
1629,MRK,16,KJV,and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid,and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean,1,MRK.16
1630,MRK,16,KJV,now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils,this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness,1,MRK.16
1631,MRK,16,KJV,and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept,and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not,0,MRK.16
1632,MRK,16,KJV,and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not,and why stand we in jeopardy every hour,1,MRK.16
1633,MRK,16,KJV,after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country,and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them,0,MRK.16
1634,MRK,16,KJV,and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them,afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen,0,MRK.16
1635,MRK,16,KJV,afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen,and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,0,MRK.16
1636,MRK,16,KJV,and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins,1,MRK.16
1637,MRK,16,KJV,he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned,and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover,0,MRK.16
1638,MRK,16,KJV,and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover,for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,1,MRK.16
1639,MRK,16,KJV,so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god,and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,1,MRK.16
1640,MRK,16,KJV,and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following,howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews,1,MRK.16
1701,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed,wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith,1,LUK.2
1702,LUK,2,KJV,and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed every one into his own city,and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child,0,LUK.2
1703,LUK,2,KJV,and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child,and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy,1,LUK.2
1704,LUK,2,KJV,and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered,wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day,1,LUK.2
1705,LUK,2,KJV,and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn,and peter said man i am not,1,LUK.2
1706,LUK,2,KJV,and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night,and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god,1,LUK.2
1707,LUK,2,KJV,and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid,and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,0,LUK.2
1708,LUK,2,KJV,and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me,1,LUK.2
1709,LUK,2,KJV,for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord,and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise,1,LUK.2
1710,LUK,2,KJV,and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men,0,LUK.2
1711,LUK,2,KJV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men,and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us,0,LUK.2

1722,LUK,2,KJV,and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel,or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife,1,LUK.2
1723,LUK,2,KJV,and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him,and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed,0,LUK.2

2041,LUK,9,KJV,for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels,but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god,0,LUK.9
2042,LUK,9,KJV,but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god,and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight ,1,LUK.9
2043,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray,and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world,1,LUK.9
2044,LUK,9,KJV,and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering,and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem,0,LUK.9

2047,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said,brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample,1,LUK.9
2048,LUK,9,KJV,while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud,abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good,1,LUK.9
2049,LUK,9,KJV,and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him,and when the voice was past jesus was found alone,0,LUK.9

2051,LUK,9,KJV,and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen,and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him,0,LUK.9
2052,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him,the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away,1,LUK.9
2053,LUK,9,KJV,and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child,then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him,1,LUK.9
2054,LUK,9,KJV,and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him,and immediately the leprosy departed from him,1,LUK.9
2055,LUK,9,KJV,and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not,and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you,0,LUK.9
2056,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you,for they are not all israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called,1,LUK.9
2057,LUK,9,KJV,and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him ,jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life,1,LUK.9
2058,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father,another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way,1,LUK.9
2059,LUK,9,KJV,and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god,and he spake this parable unto them saying what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it,1,LUK.9
2060,LUK,9,KJV,but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men,jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou,1,LUK.9
2061,LUK,9,KJV,but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying,then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest,0,LUK.9
2062,LUK,9,KJV,then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest,and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great,0,LUK.9
2063,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great,and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child,1,LUK.9
2064,LUK,9,KJV,and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us,be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality,1,LUK.9
2065,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us,and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him,0,LUK.9
2066,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him,and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem,0,LUK.9
2067,LUK,9,KJV,and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem,they say unto him because no man hath hired us,1,LUK.9
2068,LUK,9,KJV,and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did,but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,0,LUK.9
2069,LUK,9,KJV,but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them and they went to another village,0,LUK.9
2070,LUK,9,KJV,for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them and they went to another village,then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee,1,LUK.9
2071,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest,charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,1,LUK.9
2072,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head,and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written,1,LUK.9
2073,LUK,9,KJV,and he said unto another follow me,but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father,0,LUK.9
2074,LUK,9,KJV,but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father,and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration,1,LUK.9
2075,LUK,9,KJV,jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god,salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned,1,LUK.9
2076,LUK,9,KJV,and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house,and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god,0,LUK.9
2077,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god,after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come,0,LUK.9
2224,LUK,13,KJV,there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices,and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things,0,LUK.13
2225,LUK,13,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,0,LUK.13
2226,LUK,13,KJV,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem,0,LUK.13
2227,LUK,13,KJV,or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,0,LUK.13
2228,LUK,13,KJV,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none,0,LUK.13
2229,LUK,13,KJV,he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none,the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men,1,LUK.13
2230,LUK,13,KJV,then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground,and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre,1,LUK.13
2231,LUK,13,KJV,and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down,and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest,1,LUK.13
2232,LUK,13,KJV,and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself ,0,LUK.13
2233,LUK,13,KJV,and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself ,and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity,0,LUK.13
2234,LUK,13,KJV,and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity,and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god,0,LUK.13
2235,LUK,13,KJV,and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high,1,LUK.13
2236,LUK,13,KJV,and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day,but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him,1,LUK.13
2237,LUK,13,KJV,the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering,and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day,0,LUK.13
2238,LUK,13,KJV,and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day,this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church,1,LUK.13
2239,LUK,13,KJV,and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him,have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas,1,LUK.13
2240,LUK,13,KJV,then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like,and whereunto shall i resemble it,0,LUK.13
2241,LUK,13,KJV,and whereunto shall i resemble it,verily i say unto you they have their reward,1,LUK.13
2242,LUK,13,KJV,it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it,and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever,1,LUK.13
2243,LUK,13,KJV,and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god,the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind neither as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock,1,LUK.13
2244,LUK,13,KJV,it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened,now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god,1,LUK.13
2245,LUK,13,KJV,and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem,then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved,0,LUK.13
2246,LUK,13,KJV,then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved,and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able,0,LUK.13
2247,LUK,13,KJV,and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able,for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye,1,LUK.13
2248,LUK,13,KJV,when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets,but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity,0,LUK.13
2249,LUK,13,KJV,but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity,and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god,1,LUK.13
2250,LUK,13,KJV,there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out,ye do the deeds of your father,1,LUK.13
2251,LUK,13,KJV,and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god,they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate,1,LUK.13
2252,LUK,13,KJV,and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last,and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself,1,LUK.13
2253,LUK,13,KJV,the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee,and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected,0,LUK.13
2254,LUK,13,KJV,and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected,but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you,1,LUK.13
2255,LUK,13,KJV,nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem,o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,0,LUK.13
2256,LUK,13,KJV,o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him,0,LUK.13
2377,LUK,18,KJV,and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary,and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me,0,LUK.18
2378,LUK,18,KJV,and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me,and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith,0,LUK.18
2379,LUK,18,KJV,and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith,and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them,0,LUK.18
2380,LUK,18,KJV,and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them,i tell you that he will avenge them speedily,0,LUK.18
2381,LUK,18,KJV,i tell you that he will avenge them speedily,and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord,1,LUK.18
2382,LUK,18,KJV,nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth,for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise,1,LUK.18
2383,LUK,18,KJV,and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican,and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others,1,LUK.18
2384,LUK,18,KJV,the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican,i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess,0,LUK.18
2385,LUK,18,KJV,i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess,and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common,1,LUK.18
2386,LUK,18,KJV,and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner,and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul,1,LUK.18
2387,LUK,18,KJV,i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted,and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them,0,LUK.18
2388,LUK,18,KJV,and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them,but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god,0,LUK.18
2389,LUK,18,KJV,but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god,and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped,1,LUK.18
2390,LUK,18,KJV,verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,1,LUK.18
2391,LUK,18,KJV,and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life,and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men,1,LUK.18
2392,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good,none is good save one that is god,0,LUK.18
2393,LUK,18,KJV,none is good save one that is god,thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother,0,LUK.18
2394,LUK,18,KJV,thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother,and he said all these have i kept from my youth up,0,LUK.18
2395,LUK,18,KJV,and he said all these have i kept from my youth up,and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched,1,LUK.18
2396,LUK,18,KJV,now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me,and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich,0,LUK.18
2397,LUK,18,KJV,and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich,and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,0,LUK.18
2398,LUK,18,KJV,and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him,1,LUK.18
2399,LUK,18,KJV,and they that heard it said who then can be saved,and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god,0,LUK.18
2400,LUK,18,KJV,and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god,then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee,0,LUK.18
2401,LUK,18,KJV,then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee,and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting,0,LUK.18
2402,LUK,18,KJV,and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting,then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished,0,LUK.18
2403,LUK,18,KJV,then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished,so run that ye may obtain,1,LUK.18
2404,LUK,18,KJV,for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again,and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken,0,LUK.18
2405,LUK,18,KJV,and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken,and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant,0,LUK.18
2406,LUK,18,KJV,and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant,and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way,1,LUK.18
2407,LUK,18,KJV,and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by,there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down,1,LUK.18
2408,LUK,18,KJV,and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me,and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me,0,LUK.18
2409,LUK,18,KJV,and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me,and he said unto them it is enough,1,LUK.18
2410,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee,and he said lord that i may receive my sight,0,LUK.18
2411,LUK,18,KJV,and he said lord that i may receive my sight,and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you,1,LUK.18
2412,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee,and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace,1,LUK.18
2413,LUK,18,KJV,and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god,which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob,1,LUK.18
2655,LUK,24,KJV,now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them,and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre,0,LUK.24
2656,LUK,24,KJV,and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre,and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus,0,LUK.24
2657,LUK,24,KJV,and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus,and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead,0,LUK.24
2658,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead,he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again,0,LUK.24
2659,LUK,24,KJV,he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again,he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again,1,LUK.24
2660,LUK,24,KJV,and they remembered his words and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest,nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth,1,LUK.24
2661,LUK,24,KJV,it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles,it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife,1,LUK.24
2662,LUK,24,KJV,and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not,then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass,0,LUK.24
2663,LUK,24,KJV,then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass,and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs,0,LUK.24
2664,LUK,24,KJV,and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs,and they talked together of all these things which had happened,0,LUK.24
2665,LUK,24,KJV,and they talked together of all these things which had happened,and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them,0,LUK.24
2666,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them,but their eyes were holden that they should not know him,0,LUK.24
2667,LUK,24,KJV,but their eyes were holden that they should not know him,and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live,1,LUK.24
2668,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad,well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith,1,LUK.24
2669,LUK,24,KJV,and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days,if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him,1,LUK.24
2670,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them what things,and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him,0,LUK.24
2671,LUK,24,KJV,and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him,charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,1,LUK.24
2672,LUK,24,KJV,but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done,yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive,0,LUK.24
2673,LUK,24,KJV,yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive,and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee,1,LUK.24
2674,LUK,24,KJV,and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not,then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory,0,LUK.24
2675,LUK,24,KJV,then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory,now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors,1,LUK.24
2676,LUK,24,KJV,and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself,and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further,0,LUK.24
2677,LUK,24,KJV,and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further,and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel,1,LUK.24
2678,LUK,24,KJV,but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent,not in circumcision but in uncircumcision,1,LUK.24
2679,LUK,24,KJV,and he went in to tarry with them,and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them,0,LUK.24
2680,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them,and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man,1,LUK.24
2681,LUK,24,KJV,and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight,and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved,1,LUK.24
2682,LUK,24,KJV,and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures,now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment,1,LUK.24
2683,LUK,24,KJV,and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon,be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap,1,LUK.24
2684,LUK,24,KJV,and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread,and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room,1,LUK.24
2685,LUK,24,KJV,and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you,if this man were not of god he could do nothing,1,LUK.24
2686,LUK,24,KJV,but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit,but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth,1,LUK.24
2687,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them why are ye troubled,greet them that love us in the faith,1,LUK.24
2688,LUK,24,KJV,and why do thoughts arise in your hearts,behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have,0,LUK.24
2689,LUK,24,KJV,behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more,1,LUK.24
2690,LUK,24,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet,and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in,1,LUK.24
2691,LUK,24,KJV,and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat,but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon,1,LUK.24
2692,LUK,24,KJV,and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb,and he took it and did eat before them,0,LUK.24
2693,LUK,24,KJV,and he took it and did eat before them,and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me,0,LUK.24
2694,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me,then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem,0,LUK.24
2695,LUK,24,KJV,then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem,and ye are witnesses of these things,0,LUK.24
2696,LUK,24,KJV,and ye are witnesses of these things,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high,0,LUK.24
2697,LUK,24,KJV,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high,but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea,1,LUK.24
2698,LUK,24,KJV,and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them,and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven,0,LUK.24
2699,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven,and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god,0,LUK.24
2700,LUK,24,KJV,and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god,for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second,1,LUK.24
2754,JHN,2,KJV,and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage,greet amplias my beloved in the lord,1,JHN.2
2755,JHN,2,KJV,and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine,jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee,0,JHN.2
2756,JHN,2,KJV,jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee,mine hour is not yet come,0,JHN.2
2757,JHN,2,KJV,mine hour is not yet come,his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it ,0,JHN.2

2759,JHN,2,KJV,and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece,if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned,1,JHN.2
2760,JHN,2,KJV,jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water,but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me,1,JHN.2
2761,JHN,2,KJV,and they filled them up to the brim,and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast,0,JHN.2
2762,JHN,2,KJV,and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast,thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble,1,JHN.2
2763,JHN,2,KJV,when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now,this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him,0,JHN.2
2764,JHN,2,KJV,this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him,and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,1,JHN.2
2765,JHN,2,KJV,after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days,for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh,1,JHN.2
2766,JHN,2,KJV,and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise,and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,0,JHN.2
2767,JHN,2,KJV,and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed,1,JHN.2
2768,JHN,2,KJV,then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things,and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away,1,JHN.2
2769,JHN,2,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up,and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest,1,JHN.2
2770,JHN,2,KJV,then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days,and the wind ceased and there was a great calm,1,JHN.2
2771,JHN,2,KJV,but he spake of the temple of his body,these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him,1,JHN.2
2772,JHN,2,KJV,when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said,this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation,1,JHN.2
2773,JHN,2,KJV,now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did,for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things,1,JHN.2
2774,JHN,2,KJV,but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man,there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him,0,JHN.2
2983,JHN,7,KJV,after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him,now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand,0,JHN.7
2984,JHN,7,KJV,now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand,he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end,1,JHN.7
2985,JHN,7,KJV,his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest,for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly,0,JHN.7
2986,JHN,7,KJV,for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly,if thou do these things shew thyself to the world,0,JHN.7
2987,JHN,7,KJV,if thou do these things shew thyself to the world,the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here,1,JHN.7
2988,JHN,7,KJV,for neither did his brethren believe in him,then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready,0,JHN.7
2989,JHN,7,KJV,then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready,the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil,0,JHN.7
2990,JHN,7,KJV,the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil,great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation,1,JHN.7
2991,JHN,7,KJV,go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come,but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day,1,JHN.7
2992,JHN,7,KJV,when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee,but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret,0,JHN.7
2993,JHN,7,KJV,but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret,then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he,0,JHN.7
2994,JHN,7,KJV,then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he,and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people,0,JHN.7
2995,JHN,7,KJV,and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people,and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it,1,JHN.7
2996,JHN,7,KJV,howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews,if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides,1,JHN.7
2997,JHN,7,KJV,now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught,and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned,0,JHN.7
2998,JHN,7,KJV,and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned,jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me,0,JHN.7
2999,JHN,7,KJV,jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me,and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish,1,JHN.7
3000,JHN,7,KJV,if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself,and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise,1,JHN.7
3001,JHN,7,KJV,he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him,but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean,1,JHN.7
3002,JHN,7,KJV,did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law,this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead,1,JHN.7
3003,JHN,7,KJV,why go ye about to kill me,the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee,0,JHN.7
3004,JHN,7,KJV,the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee,when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him,1,JHN.7
3005,JHN,7,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel,moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man,0,JHN.7
3006,JHN,7,KJV,moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man,if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day,0,JHN.7
3007,JHN,7,KJV,if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day,and in his name shall the gentiles trust,1,JHN.7
3008,JHN,7,KJV,judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment,then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill,0,JHN.7
3009,JHN,7,KJV,then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill,and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this,1,JHN.7
3010,JHN,7,KJV,but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him,do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ,0,JHN.7
3011,JHN,7,KJV,do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ,howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is,0,JHN.7
3012,JHN,7,KJV,howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is,not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content,1,JHN.7
3013,JHN,7,KJV,then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not,but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me,0,JHN.7
3014,JHN,7,KJV,but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me,and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last,1,JHN.7
3015,JHN,7,KJV,then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come,and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire,1,JHN.7
3016,JHN,7,KJV,and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done,the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him,0,JHN.7
3017,JHN,7,KJV,the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him,then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me,0,JHN.7
3018,JHN,7,KJV,then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me,now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea,1,JHN.7
3019,JHN,7,KJV,ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come,then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him,0,JHN.7
3020,JHN,7,KJV,then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him,will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles,0,JHN.7
3021,JHN,7,KJV,will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles,what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come,0,JHN.7
3022,JHN,7,KJV,what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come,and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying art thou the christ,1,JHN.7
3023,JHN,7,KJV,in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink,hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me,1,JHN.7
3024,JHN,7,KJV,he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him,1,JHN.7
3025,JHN,7,KJV,but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet,others said this is the christ,0,JHN.7
3026,JHN,7,KJV,others said this is the christ,but some said shall christ come out of galilee,0,JHN.7
3027,JHN,7,KJV,but some said shall christ come out of galilee,and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe,1,JHN.7
3028,JHN,7,KJV,hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was,and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee,1,JHN.7
3029,JHN,7,KJV,so there was a division among the people because of him,because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see,1,JHN.7
3030,JHN,7,KJV,and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him,then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him,0,JHN.7
3031,JHN,7,KJV,then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him,the officers answered never man spake like this man,0,JHN.7
3032,JHN,7,KJV,the officers answered never man spake like this man,so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days,1,JHN.7
3033,JHN,7,KJV,then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived,and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick,1,JHN.7
3034,JHN,7,KJV,have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him,and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter ,1,JHN.7
3035,JHN,7,KJV,but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed,even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire,1,JHN.7
3036,JHN,7,KJV,nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth,and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight,1,JHN.7
3037,JHN,7,KJV,they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee,search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet,0,JHN.7
3038,JHN,7,KJV,search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet,and every man went unto his own house,0,JHN.7
3039,JHN,7,KJV,and every man went unto his own house,and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost,1,JHN.7
3040,JHN,8,KJV,jesus went unto the mount of olives,and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them,0,JHN.8
3041,JHN,8,KJV,and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them,and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery,1,JHN.8
3042,JHN,8,KJV,and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act,now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou,0,JHN.8
3043,JHN,8,KJV,now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou,this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him,0,JHN.8
3044,JHN,8,KJV,this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him,let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine,1,JHN.8
3045,JHN,8,KJV,but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not ,so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her,0,JHN.8
3046,JHN,8,KJV,so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her,and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground,0,JHN.8
3047,JHN,8,KJV,and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground,and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst,0,JHN.8
3048,JHN,8,KJV,and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst,when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers,0,JHN.8
3049,JHN,8,KJV,when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers,and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more,0,JHN.8
3050,JHN,8,KJV,and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more,then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied,1,JHN.8
3051,JHN,8,KJV,then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life,the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true,0,JHN.8
3052,JHN,8,KJV,the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true,then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come,1,JHN.8
3053,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go,ye judge after the flesh i judge no man,0,JHN.8
3054,JHN,8,KJV,ye judge after the flesh i judge no man,and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me,0,JHN.8
3055,JHN,8,KJV,and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me,and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days,1,JHN.8
3056,JHN,8,KJV,it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true,i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me,0,JHN.8
3057,JHN,8,KJV,i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me,but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation,1,JHN.8
3058,JHN,8,KJV,then said they unto him where is thy father,for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body,1,JHN.8
3059,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also,these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come,0,JHN.8
3060,JHN,8,KJV,these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come,then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come,0,JHN.8
3061,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come,then said the jews will he kill himself,0,JHN.8
3062,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews will he kill himself,because he saith whither i go ye cannot come,0,JHN.8
3063,JHN,8,KJV,because he saith whither i go ye cannot come,and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner,1,JHN.8
3064,JHN,8,KJV,and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world,i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins,0,JHN.8
3065,JHN,8,KJV,i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins,and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,1,JHN.8
3066,JHN,8,KJV,then said they unto him who art thou,they answered him jesus of nazareth,1,JHN.8
3067,JHN,8,KJV,and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning,i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him,0,JHN.8
3068,JHN,8,KJV,i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him,art thou loosed from a wife,1,JHN.8
3069,JHN,8,KJV,they understood not that he spake to them of the father,as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly,1,JHN.8
3070,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him,0,JHN.8
3071,JHN,8,KJV,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him,but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us,1,JHN.8
3072,JHN,8,KJV,as he spake these words many believed on him,then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free,0,JHN.8
3073,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free,peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew,1,JHN.8
3074,JHN,8,KJV,they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free,wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias,1,JHN.8
3075,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin,for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself,1,JHN.8
3076,JHN,8,KJV,and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever,then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt,1,JHN.8
3077,JHN,8,KJV,if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed,for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure,1,JHN.8
3078,JHN,8,KJV,i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you,i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father,0,JHN.8
3079,JHN,8,KJV,i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father,and they said the lord hath need of him,1,JHN.8
3080,JHN,8,KJV,they answered and said unto him abraham is our father,jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham,0,JHN.8
3081,JHN,8,KJV,jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham,but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham,0,JHN.8
3082,JHN,8,KJV,but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham,and why stand we in jeopardy every hour,1,JHN.8
3083,JHN,8,KJV,ye do the deeds of your father,then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god,0,JHN.8
3084,JHN,8,KJV,then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god,for we have found this man pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law,1,JHN.8
3085,JHN,8,KJV,jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me,but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil,1,JHN.8
3086,JHN,8,KJV,why do ye not understand my speech,but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly,1,JHN.8
3087,JHN,8,KJV,even because ye cannot hear my word,ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do,0,JHN.8
3088,JHN,8,KJV,ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do,and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity,1,JHN.8
3089,JHN,8,KJV,he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him,wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith,1,JHN.8
3090,JHN,8,KJV,when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it,for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance,1,JHN.8
3091,JHN,8,KJV,and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not,peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew,1,JHN.8
3092,JHN,8,KJV,which of you convinceth me of sin,for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed,1,JHN.8
3093,JHN,8,KJV,and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me,and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people,1,JHN.8
3094,JHN,8,KJV,he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god,wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for i am holy,1,JHN.8
3095,JHN,8,KJV,then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil,jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me,0,JHN.8
3096,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me,and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want,1,JHN.8
3097,JHN,8,KJV,and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth,verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death,0,JHN.8
3098,JHN,8,KJV,verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death,and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years,1,JHN.8
3099,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil,but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost,1,JHN.8
3100,JHN,8,KJV,abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death,art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead,0,JHN.8
3101,JHN,8,KJV,art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead,and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself,0,JHN.8
3102,JHN,8,KJV,and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself,jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying,0,JHN.8
3103,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying,and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light,1,JHN.8
3104,JHN,8,KJV,your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad,and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans,1,JHN.8
3105,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham,even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons,1,JHN.8
3106,JHN,8,KJV,jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am,for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him,1,JHN.8
3107,JHN,8,KJV,then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by,and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth,0,JHN.8
3196,JHN,11,KJV,now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha,and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,1,JHN.11
3197,JHN,11,KJV,it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick,then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first,1,JHN.11
3198,JHN,11,KJV,when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby,what advantage then hath the jew,1,JHN.11
3199,JHN,11,KJV,now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus,and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people,1,JHN.11
3200,JHN,11,KJV,when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was,but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart,1,JHN.11
3201,JHN,11,KJV,then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again,his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again,0,JHN.11
3202,JHN,11,KJV,his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again,jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day,0,JHN.11
3203,JHN,11,KJV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day,and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished,1,JHN.11
3204,JHN,11,KJV,if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world,and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with,1,JHN.11
3205,JHN,11,KJV,but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him,but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment,1,JHN.11
3206,JHN,11,KJV,these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep,then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well,0,JHN.11
3207,JHN,11,KJV,then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well,now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine,1,JHN.11
3208,JHN,11,KJV,howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep,for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day,1,JHN.11
3209,JHN,11,KJV,then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead,for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you,1,JHN.11
3210,JHN,11,KJV,and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him,then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him,0,JHN.11
3211,JHN,11,KJV,then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him,and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live,1,JHN.11
3212,JHN,11,KJV,then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already,now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother,0,JHN.11
3213,JHN,11,KJV,now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother,then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house,0,JHN.11
3214,JHN,11,KJV,then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house,and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us,1,JHN.11
3215,JHN,11,KJV,then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died,but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee,0,JHN.11
3216,JHN,11,KJV,but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee,jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again,0,JHN.11
3217,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again,martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day,0,JHN.11
3218,JHN,11,KJV,martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day,jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die,0,JHN.11
3219,JHN,11,KJV,jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die,and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god,1,JHN.11
3220,JHN,11,KJV,she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world,the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners,1,JHN.11
3221,JHN,11,KJV,and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee,rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets,1,JHN.11
3222,JHN,11,KJV,as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him,now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches,1,JHN.11
3223,JHN,11,KJV,now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him,the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there,0,JHN.11
3224,JHN,11,KJV,the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there,and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise,1,JHN.11
3225,JHN,11,KJV,then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died,when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him,0,JHN.11
3226,JHN,11,KJV,when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him,i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me,1,JHN.11
3227,JHN,11,KJV,they said unto him lord come and see,charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,1,JHN.11
3228,JHN,11,KJV,then said the jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died,notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols,1,JHN.11
3229,JHN,11,KJV,jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave,for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus,1,JHN.11
3230,JHN,11,KJV,it was a cave and a stone lay upon it,when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them,1,JHN.11
3231,JHN,11,KJV,jesus said take ye away the stone,but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth,1,JHN.11
3232,JHN,11,KJV,martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days,jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god,0,JHN.11
3233,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god,and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again,1,JHN.11
3234,JHN,11,KJV,then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid,and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me,0,JHN.11
3235,JHN,11,KJV,and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me,and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me,0,JHN.11
3236,JHN,11,KJV,and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me,from whence then hath it tares,1,JHN.11
3237,JHN,11,KJV,and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth,and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin,0,JHN.11
3238,JHN,11,KJV,and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin,therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten,1,JHN.11
3239,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go,behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest,1,JHN.11
3240,JHN,11,KJV,then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him,but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done,0,JHN.11
3241,JHN,11,KJV,but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done,then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we,0,JHN.11
3242,JHN,11,KJV,then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we,for this man doeth many miracles,0,JHN.11
3243,JHN,11,KJV,for this man doeth many miracles,they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened,1,JHN.11
3244,JHN,11,KJV,if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation,and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not,0,JHN.11
3245,JHN,11,KJV,and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not,and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve,1,JHN.11
3246,JHN,11,KJV,and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad,then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death,0,JHN.11
3247,JHN,11,KJV,then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death,jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples,0,JHN.11
3248,JHN,11,KJV,jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples,and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,0,JHN.11
3249,JHN,11,KJV,and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast,0,JHN.11
3250,JHN,11,KJV,then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast,now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him,0,JHN.11
3251,JHN,11,KJV,now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him,he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets,1,JHN.11
3300,JHN,13,KJV,now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end,and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself,0,JHN.13
3301,JHN,13,KJV,and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself,after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded,0,JHN.13
3302,JHN,13,KJV,after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded,then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet,0,JHN.13
3303,JHN,13,KJV,then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet,and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt,1,JHN.13
3304,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter,peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet,0,JHN.13
3305,JHN,13,KJV,peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet,and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize,1,JHN.13
3306,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me,for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful,1,JHN.13
3307,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head,and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city,1,JHN.13
3308,JHN,13,KJV,jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all,then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not,1,JHN.13
3309,JHN,13,KJV,for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean,so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you,0,JHN.13
3310,JHN,13,KJV,so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you,and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living,1,JHN.13
3311,JHN,13,KJV,ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am,if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet,0,JHN.13
3312,JHN,13,KJV,if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet,nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing,1,JHN.13
3313,JHN,13,KJV,for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you,and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me,1,JHN.13
3314,JHN,13,KJV,verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him,and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet,1,JHN.13
3315,JHN,13,KJV,if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them,for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god,1,JHN.13
3316,JHN,13,KJV,i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me,i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine,1,JHN.13
3317,JHN,13,KJV,now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me,therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ,1,JHN.13
3318,JHN,13,KJV,when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me,then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake,0,JHN.13
3319,JHN,13,KJV,then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake,whose image and superscription hath it,1,JHN.13
3320,JHN,13,KJV,now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved,and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish,1,JHN.13
3321,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake,he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it,0,JHN.13
3322,JHN,13,KJV,he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it,and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus,1,JHN.13
3323,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon,and after the sop satan entered into him,0,JHN.13
3324,JHN,13,KJV,and after the sop satan entered into him,but the very hairs of your head are all numbered,1,JHN.13
3325,JHN,13,KJV,then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly,for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him,1,JHN.13
3326,JHN,13,KJV,now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him,for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor,0,JHN.13
3327,JHN,13,KJV,for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor,he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night,0,JHN.13
3328,JHN,13,KJV,he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night,and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed,1,JHN.13
3329,JHN,13,KJV,therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him,if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him,0,JHN.13
3330,JHN,13,KJV,if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him,little children yet a little while i am with you,0,JHN.13
3331,JHN,13,KJV,little children yet a little while i am with you,cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded,1,JHN.13
3332,JHN,13,KJV,ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you,a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another,0,JHN.13
3333,JHN,13,KJV,a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another,but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth,1,JHN.13
3334,JHN,13,KJV,by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another,if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith,1,JHN.13
3335,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou,this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works,1,JHN.13
3336,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards,peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now,0,JHN.13

3483,JHN,18,KJV,now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest,the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,1,JHN.18
3484,JHN,18,KJV,and simon peter stood and warmed himself,i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you ,1,JHN.18
3485,JHN,18,KJV,they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples,fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life,1,JHN.18

3513,JHN,19,KJV,the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god,when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou,0,JHN.19
3514,JHN,19,KJV,when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou,these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father,1,JHN.19
3515,JHN,19,KJV,but jesus gave him no answer,then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me,0,JHN.19
3516,JHN,19,KJV,then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me,these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so,1,JHN.19
3517,JHN,19,KJV,knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee,for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies,1,JHN.19
3518,JHN,19,KJV,jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin,and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar,0,JHN.19
3519,JHN,19,KJV,and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar,and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not,1,JHN.19
3520,JHN,19,KJV,when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha,and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him,0,JHN.19

3522,JHN,19,KJV,pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king,there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink,1,JHN.19
3523,JHN,19,KJV,the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar,blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled,1,JHN.19
3524,JHN,19,KJV,then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified,then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you,1,JHN.19
3525,JHN,19,KJV,and they took jesus and led him away,then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ,1,JHN.19
3526,JHN,19,KJV,and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst,and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done,1,JHN.19
3527,JHN,19,KJV,and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross,and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,0,JHN.19
3528,JHN,19,KJV,and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour,1,JHN.19
3529,JHN,19,KJV,this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin,then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews,0,JHN.19
3530,JHN,19,KJV,then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews,pilate answered what i have written i have written,0,JHN.19
3531,JHN,19,KJV,pilate answered what i have written i have written,then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout,0,JHN.19
3532,JHN,19,KJV,then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout,they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots,0,JHN.19
3533,JHN,19,KJV,they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots,these things therefore the soldiers did,0,JHN.19
3534,JHN,19,KJV,these things therefore the soldiers did,we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is,1,JHN.19
3535,JHN,19,KJV,now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene,when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst,0,JHN.19
3536,JHN,19,KJV,when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst,for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt,1,JHN.19
3537,JHN,19,KJV,now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth,watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh,1,JHN.19
3538,JHN,19,KJV,when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost,the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus,1,JHN.19
3539,JHN,19,KJV,the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away,then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him,0,JHN.19
3540,JHN,19,KJV,then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him,yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble,1,JHN.19
3541,JHN,19,KJV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water,it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men,1,JHN.19
3542,JHN,19,KJV,and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe,for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken,0,JHN.19
3543,JHN,19,KJV,for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken,there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him,1,JHN.19
3544,JHN,19,KJV,and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced,take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven,1,JHN.19
3545,JHN,19,KJV,and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave,he came therefore and took the body of jesus,0,JHN.19
3546,JHN,19,KJV,he came therefore and took the body of jesus,beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is,1,JHN.19
3547,JHN,19,KJV,and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight ,herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins,1,JHN.19
3548,JHN,19,KJV,then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury,now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid,0,JHN.19
3549,JHN,19,KJV,now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid,and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned,1,JHN.19
3550,JHN,19,KJV,there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand,the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre,0,JHN.19
3582,JHN,21,KJV,after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself ,there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples,0,JHN.21
3583,JHN,21,KJV,there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples,simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing,0,JHN.21
3584,JHN,21,KJV,simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing,they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee,1,JHN.21
3585,JHN,21,KJV,they say unto him we also go with thee,they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing,0,JHN.21
3586,JHN,21,KJV,they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing,so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her,1,JHN.21
3587,JHN,21,KJV,but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus,but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not,1,JHN.21
3588,JHN,21,KJV,then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat,nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,1,JHN.21
3589,JHN,21,KJV,they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find,they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes,0,JHN.21
3590,JHN,21,KJV,they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes,therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord,0,JHN.21
3591,JHN,21,KJV,therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord,but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters,1,JHN.21
3592,JHN,21,KJV,now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea,and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes,0,JHN.21
3593,JHN,21,KJV,and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes,then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder,1,JHN.21
3594,JHN,21,KJV,as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread,and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals,1,JHN.21
3595,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught,and are not his sisters here with us,1,JHN.21
3596,JHN,21,KJV,simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken,for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh,1,JHN.21
3597,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them come and dine,and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god,1,JHN.21
3598,JHN,21,KJV,and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou,knowing that it was the lord,0,JHN.21
3599,JHN,21,KJV,knowing that it was the lord,then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest,1,JHN.21
3600,JHN,21,KJV,jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise,this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead,0,JHN.21
3601,JHN,21,KJV,this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead,so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these,0,JHN.21
3602,JHN,21,KJV,so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these,and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born,1,JHN.21
3603,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ,1,JHN.21
3604,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him feed my lambs,for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered,1,JHN.21
3605,JHN,21,KJV,he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,0,JHN.21
3606,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,he saith unto him feed my sheep,0,JHN.21
3607,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him feed my sheep,he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,0,JHN.21
3608,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god,1,JHN.21
3609,JHN,21,KJV,peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me,but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed,1,JHN.21
3610,JHN,21,KJV,and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee,or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem,1,JHN.21
3611,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto him feed my sheep,verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not,0,JHN.21
3612,JHN,21,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not,this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god,0,JHN.21
3613,JHN,21,KJV,this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god,but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned,1,JHN.21
3614,JHN,21,KJV,and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me,he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away,1,JHN.21
3615,JHN,21,KJV,then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee,to morrow said he thou shalt hear him,1,JHN.21
3616,JHN,21,KJV,peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do ,jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,0,JHN.21
3617,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,0,JHN.21
3618,JHN,21,KJV,then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true,0,JHN.21
3619,JHN,21,KJV,this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true,and he said how can i except some man should guide me,1,JHN.21
3620,JHN,21,KJV,and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written,and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me,1,JHN.21
3695,ACT,4,KJV,and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead,and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own city,1,ACT.4
3696,ACT,4,KJV,and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide,and he touched his ear and healed him,1,ACT.4
3697,ACT,4,KJV,howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand,and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world,1,ACT.4
3698,ACT,4,KJV,and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem,for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal,1,ACT.4
3699,ACT,4,KJV,and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this,and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only,1,ACT.4
3700,ACT,4,KJV,then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole,this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner,0,ACT.4
3701,ACT,4,KJV,this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner,ye fools did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also,1,ACT.4
3702,ACT,4,KJV,neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus,0,ACT.4
3703,ACT,4,KJV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus,and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it,0,ACT.4
3704,ACT,4,KJV,and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it,they understood not that he spake to them of the father,1,ACT.4
3705,ACT,4,KJV,but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men,for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it ,0,ACT.4
3706,ACT,4,KJV,for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it ,but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name,0,ACT.4
3707,ACT,4,KJV,but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name,and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus,0,ACT.4
3708,ACT,4,KJV,and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus,but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye,0,ACT.4
3709,ACT,4,KJV,but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye,for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard,0,ACT.4
3710,ACT,4,KJV,for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard,therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest,1,ACT.4
3711,ACT,4,KJV,so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done,the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth,1,ACT.4
3712,ACT,4,KJV,for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed,then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law,1,ACT.4
3713,ACT,4,KJV,and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them,and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things,0,ACT.4
3714,ACT,4,KJV,and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things,the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ,0,ACT.4
3715,ACT,4,KJV,the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ,and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him,1,ACT.4
3716,ACT,4,KJV,for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done,and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus,0,ACT.4
3717,ACT,4,KJV,and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus,and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost,1,ACT.4
3718,ACT,4,KJV,and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness,then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me,1,ACT.4
3719,ACT,4,KJV,and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common,and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all,0,ACT.4
3720,ACT,4,KJV,and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all,neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need,0,ACT.4
3721,ACT,4,KJV,neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need,and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him ,1,ACT.4
3722,ACT,4,KJV,and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet,but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet,0,ACT.4
3775,ACT,7,KJV,then said the high priest are these things so,and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee,0,ACT.7
3776,ACT,7,KJV,and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee,then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell,0,ACT.7

4998,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body,and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight,1,1CO.6
4999,1CO,6,KJV,for two saith he shall be one flesh,but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit,0,1CO.6

5003,1CO,6,KJV,for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods,now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman,0,1CO.6
5049,1CO,8,KJV,now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge,and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald,1,1CO.8
5050,1CO,8,KJV,knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth,and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,0,1CO.8
5051,1CO,8,KJV,and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all,1,1CO.8
5052,1CO,8,KJV,but if any man love god the same is known of him,and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate,1,1CO.8
5053,1CO,8,KJV,as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one,but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee,1,1CO.8
5054,1CO,8,KJV,for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him,howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled,0,1CO.8
5055,1CO,8,KJV,howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,1,1CO.8
5056,1CO,8,KJV,but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse,but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak,0,1CO.8
5057,1CO,8,KJV,but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak,for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died,0,1CO.8
5058,1CO,8,KJV,for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died,his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters,1,1CO.8
5059,1CO,8,KJV,but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ,wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend,0,1CO.8
5060,1CO,8,KJV,wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend,have i not seen jesus christ our lord,0,1CO.8
5061,1CO,9,KJV,have i not seen jesus christ our lord,are not ye my work in the lord,0,1CO.9
5062,1CO,9,KJV,are not ye my work in the lord,if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord,0,1CO.9
5063,1CO,9,KJV,if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord,mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink,0,1CO.9
5064,1CO,9,KJV,mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink,have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas,0,1CO.9
5065,1CO,9,KJV,have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas,or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working,0,1CO.9
5066,1CO,9,KJV,or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working,and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters ,1,1CO.9
5067,1CO,9,KJV,who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges,who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof,0,1CO.9
5068,1CO,9,KJV,who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof,or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock,0,1CO.9
5069,1CO,9,KJV,or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock,say i these things as a man,0,1CO.9
5070,1CO,9,KJV,say i these things as a man,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,1,1CO.9
5071,1CO,9,KJV,or saith not the law the same also,for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,0,1CO.9
5072,1CO,9,KJV,for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,doth god take care for oxen,0,1CO.9
5073,1CO,9,KJV,doth god take care for oxen,for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children,1,1CO.9
5074,1CO,9,KJV,or saith he it altogether for our sakes,now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me,1,1CO.9
5075,1CO,9,KJV,for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope,for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak,1,1CO.9
5076,1CO,9,KJV,if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things,if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather,0,1CO.9
5077,1CO,9,KJV,if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather,and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews,1,1CO.9
5078,1CO,9,KJV,nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ,do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple,0,1CO.9
5079,1CO,9,KJV,do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple,and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar,0,1CO.9
5080,1CO,9,KJV,and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar,if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed,1,1CO.9
5081,1CO,9,KJV,even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel,but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void,0,1CO.9
5082,1CO,9,KJV,but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void,for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me,0,1CO.9
5083,1CO,9,KJV,for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me,now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee,1,1CO.9
5084,1CO,9,KJV,verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel,for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more,0,1CO.9
5085,1CO,9,KJV,for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more,for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise,1,1CO.9
5086,1CO,9,KJV,and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law,to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some,0,1CO.9
5087,1CO,9,KJV,to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some,then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground,1,1CO.9
5088,1CO,9,KJV,and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize,so run that ye may obtain,0,1CO.9
5089,1CO,9,KJV,so run that ye may obtain,and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things,0,1CO.9
5090,1CO,9,KJV,and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things,and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people,1,1CO.9
5091,1CO,9,KJV,now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible,john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,1,1CO.9
5092,1CO,9,KJV,i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway,and they parted his raiment and cast lots,1,1CO.9
5182,1CO,13,KJV,though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal,and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing,0,1CO.13
5183,1CO,13,KJV,and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing,and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing,0,1CO.13
5184,1CO,13,KJV,and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing,charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things,0,1CO.13
5185,1CO,13,KJV,charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things,charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,0,1CO.13
5186,1CO,13,KJV,charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy,1,1CO.13
5187,1CO,13,KJV,for we know in part and we prophesy in part,and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them,1,1CO.13
5188,1CO,13,KJV,but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away,when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things,0,1CO.13
5189,1CO,13,KJV,when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things,for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known,0,1CO.13
5190,1CO,13,KJV,for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known,for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man,1,1CO.13
5191,1CO,13,KJV,and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity,follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy,0,1CO.13
5233,1CO,15,KJV,moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain,for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep,0,1CO.15
5234,1CO,15,KJV,for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep,after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles,0,1CO.15
5235,1CO,15,KJV,after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles,and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time,0,1CO.15
5236,1CO,15,KJV,and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time,for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,0,1CO.15
5237,1CO,15,KJV,for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me,0,1CO.15
5238,1CO,15,KJV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me,therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed,0,1CO.15
5239,1CO,15,KJV,therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed,now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead,0,1CO.15
5240,1CO,15,KJV,now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead,bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,1,1CO.15
5241,1CO,15,KJV,but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain,and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon,1,1CO.15
5242,1CO,15,KJV,yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not,who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me,1,1CO.15
5243,1CO,15,KJV,for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins,then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished,0,1CO.15
5244,1CO,15,KJV,then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished,if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable,0,1CO.15
5245,1CO,15,KJV,if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable,but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,0,1CO.15
5246,1CO,15,KJV,but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do,1,1CO.15
5247,1CO,15,KJV,for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation,1,1CO.15
5248,1CO,15,KJV,for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive,christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith,1,1CO.15
5249,1CO,15,KJV,but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming,then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power,0,1CO.15
5250,1CO,15,KJV,then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power,and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name,1,1CO.15
5251,1CO,15,KJV,for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet,the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,0,1CO.15
5252,1CO,15,KJV,the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever,1,1CO.15
5253,1CO,15,KJV,for he hath put all things under his feet,i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning,1,1CO.15
5254,1CO,15,KJV,but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him,and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all,0,1CO.15
5255,1CO,15,KJV,and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all,and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him,1,1CO.15
5256,1CO,15,KJV,else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all,for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,1,1CO.15
5257,1CO,15,KJV,why are they then baptized for the dead,and why stand we in jeopardy every hour,0,1CO.15
5258,1CO,15,KJV,and why stand we in jeopardy every hour,and he answered him and said thou sayest it then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man,1,1CO.15
5259,1CO,15,KJV,i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily,if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not,0,1CO.15
5260,1CO,15,KJV,if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not,and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him,1,1CO.15
5261,1CO,15,KJV,let us eat and drink for to morrow we die,stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,1,1CO.15
5262,1CO,15,KJV,be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners,then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men,1,1CO.15
5263,1CO,15,KJV,awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame,but some man will say how are the dead raised up,0,1CO.15
5264,1CO,15,KJV,but some man will say how are the dead raised up,and with what body do they come,0,1CO.15
5265,1CO,15,KJV,and with what body do they come,thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body,0,1CO.15
5266,1CO,15,KJV,thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body,ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin,1,1CO.15
5267,1CO,15,KJV,all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds,then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him ,1,1CO.15
5268,1CO,15,KJV,there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory,0,1CO.15
5269,1CO,15,KJV,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again,1,1CO.15
5270,1CO,15,KJV,so also is the resurrection of the dead,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it,1,1CO.15
5271,1CO,15,KJV,it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body,there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body,0,1CO.15
5272,1CO,15,KJV,there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body,bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,1,1CO.15
5273,1CO,15,KJV,and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit,howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual,0,1CO.15
5274,1CO,15,KJV,howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual,the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven,0,1CO.15
5275,1CO,15,KJV,the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven,as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly,0,1CO.15
5276,1CO,15,KJV,as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly,nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord,1,1CO.15
5277,1CO,15,KJV,and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly,so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god,1,1CO.15
5278,1CO,15,KJV,now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed,0,1CO.15
5279,1CO,15,KJV,behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed,for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality,0,1CO.15
5280,1CO,15,KJV,for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality,for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ,1,1CO.15
5281,1CO,15,KJV,so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory,and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great,1,1CO.15
5282,1CO,15,KJV,o death where is thy sting,o grave where is thy victory,0,1CO.15
5283,1CO,15,KJV,o grave where is thy victory,and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them,1,1CO.15
5284,1CO,15,KJV,the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law,and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues,1,1CO.15
5285,1CO,15,KJV,but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ,for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men,1,1CO.15
5286,1CO,15,KJV,therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord,now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye,0,1CO.15
5329,2CO,2,KJV,but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness,if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him,1,2CO.2
5330,2CO,2,KJV,for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me,and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all,0,2CO.2
5331,2CO,2,KJV,and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all,let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law,1,2CO.2
5332,2CO,2,KJV,for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you,but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all,0,2CO.2
5333,2CO,2,KJV,but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all,sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many,0,2CO.2
5334,2CO,2,KJV,sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many,he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks,1,2CO.2
5335,2CO,2,KJV,so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow,wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him,0,2CO.2
5336,2CO,2,KJV,wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him,for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things,0,2CO.2
5337,2CO,2,KJV,for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things,and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet,1,2CO.2
5338,2CO,2,KJV,to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices,furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia,0,2CO.2
5339,2CO,2,KJV,furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia,now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place,0,2CO.2
5340,2CO,2,KJV,now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place,for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life,0,2CO.2
5341,2CO,2,KJV,for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life,and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty,1,2CO.2
5342,2CO,2,KJV,and who is sufficient for these things,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ,0,2CO.2
5343,2CO,2,KJV,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ,do we begin again to commend ourselves,0,2CO.2
5344,2CO,3,KJV,do we begin again to commend ourselves,and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,1,2CO.3
5345,2CO,3,KJV,or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you,ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart,0,2CO.3
5346,2CO,3,KJV,ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart,and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life,0,2CO.3
5347,2CO,3,KJV,and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life,these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father,1,2CO.3
5348,2CO,3,KJV,but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious,him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me,1,2CO.3
5349,2CO,3,KJV,for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory,wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection,1,2CO.3
5350,2CO,3,KJV,for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth,for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,0,2CO.3
5351,2CO,3,KJV,for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ,0,2CO.3
5352,2CO,3,KJV,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ,but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart,0,2CO.3
5353,2CO,3,KJV,but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart,nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away,0,2CO.3
5354,2CO,3,KJV,nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty,0,2CO.3
5355,2CO,3,KJV,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty,and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth,1,2CO.3
5356,2CO,3,KJV,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing,1,2CO.3
5369,2CO,5,KJV,for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another,1,2CO.5
5370,2CO,5,KJV,for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked,for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,0,2CO.5
5371,2CO,5,KJV,for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship,1,2CO.5
5372,2CO,5,KJV,now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit,therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord,0,2CO.5
5373,2CO,5,KJV,therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord,wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him,0,2CO.5
5374,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him,for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,0,2CO.5
5375,2CO,5,KJV,for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots,1,2CO.5
5376,2CO,5,KJV,knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences,for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart,0,2CO.5
5377,2CO,5,KJV,for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart,for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause,0,2CO.5
5378,2CO,5,KJV,for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause,then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned,1,2CO.5
5379,2CO,5,KJV,for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more,0,2CO.5
5380,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more,salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned,1,2CO.5
5381,2CO,5,KJV,therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new,and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,0,2CO.5
5382,2CO,5,KJV,and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god,0,2CO.5
5383,2CO,5,KJV,now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god,wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands,1,2CO.5
5384,2CO,5,KJV,for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him,then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ,1,2CO.5
5397,2CO,7,KJV,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding,1,2CO.7

5665,EPH,2,KJV,for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh,for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father,0,EPH.2

6141,HEB,2,KJV,for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him,and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men,1,HEB.2
6142,HEB,2,KJV,but now we see not yet all things put under him,but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man,0,HEB.2
6143,HEB,2,KJV,but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man,for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings,0,HEB.2

6150,HEB,2,KJV,wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans,1,HEB.2
6151,HEB,2,KJV,for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted,wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house,0,HEB.2

6334,HEB,13,KJV,for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp,wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate,0,HEB.13
6335,HEB,13,KJV,wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate,let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach,0,HEB.13
