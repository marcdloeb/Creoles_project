2,MAT,1,KJV,so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david until the carrying away into babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are fourteen generations,and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey,1,MAT.1
3,MAT,1,KJV,now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost,then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily,0,MAT.1
4,MAT,1,KJV,then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily,but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost,0,MAT.1
5,MAT,1,KJV,but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost,and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins,0,MAT.1
6,MAT,1,KJV,and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins,now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you,1,MAT.1
7,MAT,1,KJV,now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us,but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves,1,MAT.1
8,MAT,1,KJV,then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus,whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god,1,MAT.1
9,MAT,2,KJV,now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews,for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him,0,MAT.2
10,MAT,2,KJV,for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him,when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him,0,MAT.2
11,MAT,2,KJV,when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him,and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born,0,MAT.2
12,MAT,2,KJV,and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born,and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel,0,MAT.2
13,MAT,2,KJV,and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel,then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared,0,MAT.2
14,MAT,2,KJV,then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared,and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also,0,MAT.2
15,MAT,2,KJV,and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also,but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1,MAT.2
16,MAT,2,KJV,when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was,when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,0,MAT.2
17,MAT,2,KJV,when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof,1,MAT.2
18,MAT,2,KJV,and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh,and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you,1,MAT.2
19,MAT,2,KJV,and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way,jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father,1,MAT.2
20,MAT,2,KJV,and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him,when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son,0,MAT.2
21,MAT,2,KJV,when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son,then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men,0,MAT.2
22,MAT,2,KJV,then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men,then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not,0,MAT.2
23,MAT,2,KJV,then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not,they shall make known unto you all things which are done here,1,MAT.2
24,MAT,2,KJV,but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young childs life,the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus,1,MAT.2
25,MAT,2,KJV,and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel,but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene,0,MAT.2
26,MAT,2,KJV,but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene,in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,0,MAT.2
27,MAT,3,KJV,in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight,0,MAT.3
28,MAT,3,KJV,for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight,when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed,1,MAT.3
29,MAT,3,KJV,and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey,these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority,1,MAT.3
30,MAT,3,KJV,then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins,nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,1,MAT.3
31,MAT,3,KJV,but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come,bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,0,MAT.3
32,MAT,3,KJV,bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not,1,MAT.3
33,MAT,3,KJV,and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire,0,MAT.3
34,MAT,3,KJV,i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire,then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him,0,MAT.3
35,MAT,3,KJV,then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him,for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness,1,MAT.3
36,MAT,3,KJV,but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me,and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,0,MAT.3
37,MAT,3,KJV,and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased,0,MAT.3
38,MAT,3,KJV,and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased,then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil,0,MAT.3
39,MAT,4,KJV,then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil,and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred,0,MAT.4
40,MAT,4,KJV,and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred,and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread,0,MAT.4
41,MAT,4,KJV,and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread,but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god,0,MAT.4
42,MAT,4,KJV,but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god,then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone,0,MAT.4

47,MAT,4,KJV,then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him,now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up,0,MAT.4

89,MAT,5,KJV,ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also,if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light,1,MAT.5
90,MAT,5,KJV,and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloke also,and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain,0,MAT.5

513,MAT,17,KJV,then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias,thou hast the words of eternal life,1,MAT.17
514,MAT,17,KJV,while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time,1,MAT.17
515,MAT,17,KJV,and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid,and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid,0,MAT.17
516,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid,for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god,1,MAT.17
517,MAT,17,KJV,and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only,and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead,0,MAT.17
518,MAT,17,KJV,and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead,if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself,1,MAT.17
519,MAT,17,KJV,and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come,and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things,0,MAT.17
520,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things,by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god,1,MAT.17
521,MAT,17,KJV,but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed,likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them,0,MAT.17
522,MAT,17,KJV,likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them,then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist,0,MAT.17
523,MAT,17,KJV,then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist,and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her,1,MAT.17
524,MAT,17,KJV,and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water,and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him,0,MAT.17
525,MAT,17,KJV,and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him,but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you,1,MAT.17
526,MAT,17,KJV,then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you,how long shall i suffer you,0,MAT.17
527,MAT,17,KJV,how long shall i suffer you,and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour,0,MAT.17
528,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour,then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out,0,MAT.17
529,MAT,17,KJV,then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out,and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you,0,MAT.17
530,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you,and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word,1,MAT.17
531,MAT,17,KJV,howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting,when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life,1,MAT.17
532,MAT,17,KJV,and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again,and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute,0,MAT.17
533,MAT,17,KJV,and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute,and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain,1,MAT.17
534,MAT,17,KJV,and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying what thinkest thou simon,of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute,0,MAT.17
535,MAT,17,KJV,of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute,then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders,1,MAT.17
536,MAT,17,KJV,of their own children or of strangers,peter saith unto him of strangers,0,MAT.17
537,MAT,17,KJV,peter saith unto him of strangers,jesus saith unto him then are the children free,0,MAT.17
538,MAT,17,KJV,jesus saith unto him then are the children free,notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee,0,MAT.17
539,MAT,17,KJV,notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee,at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,0,MAT.17
572,MAT,19,KJV,and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there,but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed,1,MAT.19
573,MAT,19,KJV,the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause,and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh,0,MAT.19
574,MAT,19,KJV,and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh,wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh,0,MAT.19
575,MAT,19,KJV,wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh,what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder,0,MAT.19
576,MAT,19,KJV,what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder,but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house,1,MAT.19
577,MAT,19,KJV,they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away,and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome,1,MAT.19
578,MAT,19,KJV,he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so,and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery,0,MAT.19
579,MAT,19,KJV,and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery,and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar,1,MAT.19
580,MAT,19,KJV,his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry,and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise,1,MAT.19
581,MAT,19,KJV,but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given,for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake,0,MAT.19
582,MAT,19,KJV,for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake,let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach,1,MAT.19
583,MAT,19,KJV,he that is able to receive it let him receive it then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them,but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven,0,MAT.19
584,MAT,19,KJV,but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven,and he laid his hands on them and departed thence,0,MAT.19
585,MAT,19,KJV,and he laid his hands on them and departed thence,and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life,0,MAT.19
586,MAT,19,KJV,and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life,and he said unto him why callest thou me good,0,MAT.19
587,MAT,19,KJV,and he said unto him why callest thou me good,there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments,0,MAT.19
588,MAT,19,KJV,there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments,jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,0,MAT.19
589,MAT,19,KJV,jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness,1,MAT.19
590,MAT,19,KJV,the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet,and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him,1,MAT.19
591,MAT,19,KJV,jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me,for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise,1,MAT.19
592,MAT,19,KJV,but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions,fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged,1,MAT.19
593,MAT,19,KJV,then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven,and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god,1,MAT.19
594,MAT,19,KJV,and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved,0,MAT.19
595,MAT,19,KJV,when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved,but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible,0,MAT.19
596,MAT,19,KJV,but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible,then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore,0,MAT.19
597,MAT,19,KJV,then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore,and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers name written in their foreheads,1,MAT.19
598,MAT,19,KJV,and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life,0,MAT.19
599,MAT,19,KJV,and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life,and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee,1,MAT.19
600,MAT,19,KJV,but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first,and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ,1,MAT.19
601,MAT,20,KJV,for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard,howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual,1,MAT.20
602,MAT,20,KJV,and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard,and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful,1,MAT.20
603,MAT,20,KJV,and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you,again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise,0,MAT.20
604,MAT,20,KJV,again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise,and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle,0,MAT.20
605,MAT,20,KJV,and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle,they say unto him because no man hath hired us,0,MAT.20
606,MAT,20,KJV,they say unto him because no man hath hired us,he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive,0,MAT.20
607,MAT,20,KJV,he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive,not as though the word of god hath taken none effect,1,MAT.20
608,MAT,20,KJV,so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first,and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny,0,MAT.20
609,MAT,20,KJV,and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny,but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny,0,MAT.20
610,MAT,20,KJV,but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny,and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the house saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day,0,MAT.20
611,MAT,20,KJV,and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the house saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day,but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny,0,MAT.20
612,MAT,20,KJV,but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny,take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee,0,MAT.20
613,MAT,20,KJV,take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee,is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own,0,MAT.20
614,MAT,20,KJV,is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own,afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed,1,MAT.20
615,MAT,20,KJV,is thine eye evil because i am good,then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest,1,MAT.20
616,MAT,20,KJV,so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen,and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again,0,MAT.20
617,MAT,20,KJV,and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again,and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail,1,MAT.20
618,MAT,20,KJV,then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him,and he said unto her what wilt thou,0,MAT.20
619,MAT,20,KJV,and he said unto her what wilt thou,she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom,0,MAT.20
620,MAT,20,KJV,she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom,but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask,0,MAT.20
621,MAT,20,KJV,but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask,verily i say unto you they have their reward,1,MAT.20
622,MAT,20,KJV,are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with,they say unto him we are able,0,MAT.20
623,MAT,20,KJV,they say unto him we are able,and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus,1,MAT.20
624,MAT,20,KJV,and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father,and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren,0,MAT.20
625,MAT,20,KJV,and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren,this he said signifying what death he should die,1,MAT.20
626,MAT,20,KJV,but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them,but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many,0,MAT.20
627,MAT,20,KJV,but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many,and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you but of the ship,1,MAT.20
628,MAT,20,KJV,and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him,thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet,1,MAT.20
629,MAT,20,KJV,and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david,and he asked them how many loaves have ye,1,MAT.20
630,MAT,20,KJV,and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david,but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests,1,MAT.20
631,MAT,20,KJV,and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you,they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened,0,MAT.20
632,MAT,20,KJV,they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened,for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality,1,MAT.20
633,MAT,20,KJV,so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him,and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me,0,MAT.20
634,MAT,21,KJV,and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me,for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth,1,MAT.21
635,MAT,21,KJV,and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them,a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory,1,MAT.21
636,MAT,21,KJV,all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an ass,and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon,0,MAT.21
637,MAT,21,KJV,and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon,and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way,0,MAT.21
638,MAT,21,KJV,and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way,and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest,0,MAT.21
639,MAT,21,KJV,and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest,for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil into the wilderness and jesus asked him saying what is thy name,1,MAT.21
640,MAT,21,KJV,and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this,and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee,0,MAT.21
641,MAT,21,KJV,and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee,it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men,1,MAT.21
642,MAT,21,KJV,and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves,and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them,0,MAT.21
643,MAT,21,KJV,and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them,and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick,1,MAT.21
644,MAT,21,KJV,and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased and said unto him hearest thou what these say,that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it,1,MAT.21
645,MAT,21,KJV,and jesus saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise,and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there,0,MAT.21
646,MAT,21,KJV,and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there,for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead,1,MAT.21
647,MAT,21,KJV,now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered,and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever,0,MAT.21
648,MAT,21,KJV,and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever,and presently the fig tree withered away,0,MAT.21
649,MAT,21,KJV,and presently the fig tree withered away,now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles,1,MAT.21
650,MAT,21,KJV,and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done,and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive,0,MAT.21
651,MAT,21,KJV,and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive,and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things,0,MAT.21
652,MAT,21,KJV,and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things,and who gave thee this authority,0,MAT.21
653,MAT,21,KJV,and who gave thee this authority,why are they then baptized for the dead,1,MAT.21
654,MAT,21,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things,and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink,1,MAT.21
655,MAT,21,KJV,the baptism of john whence was it,and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced,1,MAT.21
656,MAT,21,KJV,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him,now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means,1,MAT.21
657,MAT,21,KJV,but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet,and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell,0,MAT.21
658,MAT,21,KJV,and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell,my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation,1,MAT.21
659,MAT,21,KJV,and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things,now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve,1,MAT.21
660,MAT,21,KJV,a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard,i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue,1,MAT.21
661,MAT,21,KJV,he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and went,and he came to the second and said likewise,0,MAT.21
662,MAT,21,KJV,and he came to the second and said likewise,but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny,1,MAT.21
663,MAT,21,KJV,and he answered and said i go sir and went not,whether of them twain did the will of his father,0,MAT.21
664,MAT,21,KJV,whether of them twain did the will of his father,they say unto him the first,0,MAT.21

666,MAT,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you,and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him,1,MAT.21
667,MAT,21,KJV,for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him,hear another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it,0,MAT.21

669,MAT,21,KJV,and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another,now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour ,1,MAT.21

671,MAT,21,KJV,but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son,humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up,1,MAT.21
672,MAT,21,KJV,but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance,and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen,0,MAT.21
673,MAT,21,KJV,and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen,and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done,1,MAT.21
674,MAT,21,KJV,they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons,jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,0,MAT.21

677,MAT,21,KJV,and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder,but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment,1,MAT.21
678,MAT,21,KJV,and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them,but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet,0,MAT.21
679,MAT,21,KJV,but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet,and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight,1,MAT.21
680,MAT,22,KJV,and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come,again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage,0,MAT.22
681,MAT,22,KJV,again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage,but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city,0,MAT.22
682,MAT,22,KJV,but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city,we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us,1,MAT.22
683,MAT,22,KJV,then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy,go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage,0,MAT.22
684,MAT,22,KJV,go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage,so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests,0,MAT.22
685,MAT,22,KJV,so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests,and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment,0,MAT.22
686,MAT,22,KJV,and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment,then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,0,MAT.22
687,MAT,22,KJV,then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy,1,MAT.22
688,MAT,22,KJV,for many are called but few are chosen,at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you,1,MAT.22
689,MAT,22,KJV,then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk,and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men,0,MAT.22
690,MAT,22,KJV,and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men,for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ,1,MAT.22
691,MAT,22,KJV,tell us therefore what thinkest thou,is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not,0,MAT.22
692,MAT,22,KJV,is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not,but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites,0,MAT.22
693,MAT,22,KJV,but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites,howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island,1,MAT.22
694,MAT,22,KJV,and they brought unto him a penny,jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,1,MAT.22
695,MAT,22,KJV,and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription,but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you,1,MAT.22
696,MAT,22,KJV,then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods,he saith unto him feed my lambs,1,MAT.22
697,MAT,22,KJV,when they had heard these words they marvelled and left him and went their way,but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him,1,MAT.22
698,MAT,22,KJV,the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked him saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh,0,MAT.22
699,MAT,22,KJV,now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh,thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet,1,MAT.22
700,MAT,22,KJV,and last of all the woman died also,let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well,1,MAT.22
701,MAT,22,KJV,therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven,jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god,0,MAT.22
702,MAT,22,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven,0,MAT.22
703,MAT,22,KJV,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven,but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,0,MAT.22
704,MAT,22,KJV,but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man,1,MAT.22
705,MAT,22,KJV,god is not the god of the dead but of the living,and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine,0,MAT.22
706,MAT,22,KJV,and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine,behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them,1,MAT.22
707,MAT,22,KJV,but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together,and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations,1,MAT.22
708,MAT,22,KJV,then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law,jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind,0,MAT.22
709,MAT,22,KJV,jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind,this is the first and great commandment,0,MAT.22
710,MAT,22,KJV,this is the first and great commandment,and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,0,MAT.22
711,MAT,22,KJV,and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him,1,MAT.22
712,MAT,22,KJV,on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them saying what think ye of christ,0,MAT.22
713,MAT,22,KJV,while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them saying what think ye of christ,they say unto him the son of david,0,MAT.22
714,MAT,22,KJV,they say unto him the son of david,he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,0,MAT.22
715,MAT,22,KJV,he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,if david then call him lord how is he his son,0,MAT.22
716,MAT,22,KJV,if david then call him lord how is he his son,and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet,1,MAT.22
717,MAT,22,KJV,and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions,then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not,0,MAT.22
718,MAT,23,KJV,then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not,for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers,0,MAT.23
719,MAT,23,KJV,for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers,for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all,1,MAT.23
720,MAT,23,KJV,but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi,but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren,0,MAT.23
721,MAT,23,KJV,but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren,and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven,0,MAT.23
722,MAT,23,KJV,and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven,neither be ye called masters for one is your master even christ,0,MAT.23
723,MAT,23,KJV,neither be ye called masters for one is your master even christ,but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant,0,MAT.23
724,MAT,23,KJV,but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant,and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted,0,MAT.23
725,MAT,23,KJV,and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted,but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in,0,MAT.23
726,MAT,23,KJV,but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in,so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch,1,MAT.23
727,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,0,MAT.23
728,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold,0,MAT.23
729,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold,and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty,0,MAT.23
730,MAT,23,KJV,and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty,but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers,1,MAT.23
731,MAT,23,KJV,ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift,and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren,1,MAT.23
732,MAT,23,KJV,whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon,and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein,0,MAT.23
733,MAT,23,KJV,and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein,and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon,0,MAT.23
734,MAT,23,KJV,and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone,0,MAT.23
735,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone,but i speak this by permission and not of commandment,1,MAT.23
736,MAT,23,KJV,ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess,0,MAT.23
737,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess,thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also,0,MAT.23
738,MAT,23,KJV,thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also,and they parted his raiment and cast lots,1,MAT.23
739,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness,even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity,0,MAT.23
740,MAT,23,KJV,even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity,and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,1,MAT.23
741,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets,and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread,1,MAT.23
742,MAT,23,KJV,wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets,fill ye up then the measure of your fathers,0,MAT.23
743,MAT,23,KJV,fill ye up then the measure of your fathers,if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not,1,MAT.23
744,MAT,23,KJV,ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell,therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days,1,MAT.23
745,MAT,23,KJV,wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar,and when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea,1,MAT.23
746,MAT,23,KJV,verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation,o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate,0,MAT.23
747,MAT,23,KJV,o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate,for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,0,MAT.23
748,MAT,23,KJV,for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words,1,MAT.23

759,MAT,24,KJV,then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake,and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming,1,MAT.24
760,MAT,24,KJV,and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another,and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many,0,MAT.24
761,MAT,24,KJV,and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many,behold i come as a thief,1,MAT.24
762,MAT,24,KJV,and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold,blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,1,MAT.24

772,MAT,24,KJV,for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be,on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air,1,MAT.24
773,MAT,24,KJV,for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together,for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit,1,MAT.24
774,MAT,24,KJV,immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory,he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,1,MAT.24
775,MAT,24,KJV,and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other,now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors,0,MAT.24
776,MAT,24,KJV,now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors,verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled,0,MAT.24
777,MAT,24,KJV,verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled,and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight,1,MAT.24

779,MAT,24,KJV,but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only,but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son of man be,0,MAT.24
780,MAT,24,KJV,but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son of man be,and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches,1,MAT.24
781,MAT,24,KJV,for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be,for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill,1,MAT.24
782,MAT,24,KJV,then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left,two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left,0,MAT.24

784,MAT,24,KJV,watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come,and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell,1,MAT.24
785,MAT,24,KJV,but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up,but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said tabitha arise,1,MAT.24
786,MAT,24,KJV,therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh,who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season,0,MAT.24
787,MAT,24,KJV,who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season,blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing,0,MAT.24

789,MAT,24,KJV,verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods,what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed,1,MAT.24
790,MAT,24,KJV,but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom,0,MAT.24
791,MAT,25,KJV,then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom,to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ,1,MAT.25
792,MAT,25,KJV,and five of them were wise and five were foolish,they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps,0,MAT.25
793,MAT,25,KJV,they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps,for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me ,1,MAT.25
794,MAT,25,KJV,while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept,but rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto you,1,MAT.25
795,MAT,25,KJV,and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him,then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps,0,MAT.25
796,MAT,25,KJV,then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps,and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out,0,MAT.25
797,MAT,25,KJV,and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out,if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god,1,MAT.25
798,MAT,25,KJV,but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves,and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut,0,MAT.25
799,MAT,25,KJV,and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut,afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us,0,MAT.25
800,MAT,25,KJV,afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us,and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway,1,MAT.25
801,MAT,25,KJV,but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not,but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me,1,MAT.25
802,MAT,25,KJV,watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh,now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god ,1,MAT.25
803,MAT,25,KJV,for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods,and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him,1,MAT.25
804,MAT,25,KJV,and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey,then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents,0,MAT.25
805,MAT,25,KJV,then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents,therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear,1,MAT.25
806,MAT,25,KJV,and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two,but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lords money,0,MAT.25
807,MAT,25,KJV,but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lords money,after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them,0,MAT.25
808,MAT,25,KJV,after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them,for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles,1,MAT.25
809,MAT,25,KJV,and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more,his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord,0,MAT.25
810,MAT,25,KJV,his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord,of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute,1,MAT.25
811,MAT,25,KJV,he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them,his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord,0,MAT.25
812,MAT,25,KJV,his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord,and they all condemned him to be guilty of death,1,MAT.25
813,MAT,25,KJV,then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine,his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury,0,MAT.25
814,MAT,25,KJV,his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury,take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents,0,MAT.25
815,MAT,25,KJV,take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents,ye have heaped treasure together for the last days,1,MAT.25
816,MAT,25,KJV,for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphas and the church which is in his house,1,MAT.25
817,MAT,25,KJV,and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left,0,MAT.25
818,MAT,25,KJV,when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left,then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me,0,MAT.25
819,MAT,25,KJV,then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me,then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee ,0,MAT.25
820,MAT,25,KJV,then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee ,and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece,1,MAT.25
821,MAT,25,KJV,or thirsty and gave thee drink,in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him,1,MAT.25
822,MAT,25,KJV,when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in,and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets,1,MAT.25
823,MAT,25,KJV,or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee,sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,1,MAT.25
824,MAT,25,KJV,and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me,heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give,1,MAT.25
825,MAT,25,KJV,then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not,and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you,1,MAT.25
826,MAT,25,KJV,then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee,the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die,1,MAT.25
827,MAT,25,KJV,then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me,and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal,0,MAT.25
828,MAT,25,KJV,and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal,for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake,1,MAT.25
829,MAT,26,KJV,and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified,they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened,1,MAT.26
830,MAT,26,KJV,then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty and kill him ,there is difference also between a wife and a virgin,1,MAT.26
831,MAT,26,KJV,but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people,and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together,1,MAT.26
832,MAT,26,KJV,now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat,jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent,1,MAT.26
833,MAT,26,KJV,but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste,for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor,0,MAT.26
834,MAT,26,KJV,for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor,of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand,1,MAT.26
835,MAT,26,KJV,when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman,then called he them in and lodged them ,1,MAT.26
836,MAT,26,KJV,for she hath wrought a good work upon me,for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always,0,MAT.26
837,MAT,26,KJV,for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always,for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial,0,MAT.26
838,MAT,26,KJV,for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial,and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him,1,MAT.26
839,MAT,26,KJV,verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her,and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight,1,MAT.26
840,MAT,26,KJV,then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you,and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver,0,MAT.26
841,MAT,26,KJV,and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver,and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him,0,MAT.26
842,MAT,26,KJV,and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him,now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover,0,MAT.26
843,MAT,26,KJV,now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover,and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples,0,MAT.26
844,MAT,26,KJV,and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples,and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover,0,MAT.26
845,MAT,26,KJV,and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover,now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve,0,MAT.26
846,MAT,26,KJV,now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve,and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me,0,MAT.26
847,MAT,26,KJV,and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me,and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive,1,MAT.26
848,MAT,26,KJV,and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i,and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me,0,MAT.26
849,MAT,26,KJV,and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me,the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born,0,MAT.26
850,MAT,26,KJV,the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born,but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death,1,MAT.26
851,MAT,26,KJV,then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i,he said unto him thou hast said,0,MAT.26
852,MAT,26,KJV,he said unto him thou hast said,and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth,1,MAT.26
853,MAT,26,KJV,and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body,therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i should heal them,1,MAT.26
854,MAT,26,KJV,and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins,these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth,1,MAT.26
855,MAT,26,KJV,but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives,0,MAT.26
856,MAT,26,KJV,and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives,then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad,0,MAT.26
857,MAT,26,KJV,then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad,but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee,0,MAT.26
858,MAT,26,KJV,but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee,therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness,1,MAT.26
859,MAT,26,KJV,peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended,jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice,0,MAT.26
860,MAT,26,KJV,jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice,remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound,1,MAT.26
861,MAT,26,KJV,peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee,likewise also said all the disciples,0,MAT.26
862,MAT,26,KJV,likewise also said all the disciples,therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle,1,MAT.26
863,MAT,26,KJV,then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder,and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy,0,MAT.26
864,MAT,26,KJV,and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy,then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me,0,MAT.26
865,MAT,26,KJV,then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me,and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour,0,MAT.26
866,MAT,26,KJV,and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour,then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again,1,MAT.26
867,MAT,26,KJV,watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done,0,MAT.26
868,MAT,26,KJV,he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done,and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy,0,MAT.26
869,MAT,26,KJV,and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy,and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles,1,MAT.26
870,MAT,26,KJV,and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words,and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant,1,MAT.26
871,MAT,26,KJV,then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners,rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me,0,MAT.26
872,MAT,26,KJV,rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me,and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people,0,MAT.26
873,MAT,26,KJV,and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people,for your obedience is come abroad unto all men ,1,MAT.26
874,MAT,26,KJV,now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast,do thy diligence to come before winter,1,MAT.26
875,MAT,26,KJV,and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him,and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come,0,MAT.26
876,MAT,26,KJV,and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come,and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead,1,MAT.26
877,MAT,26,KJV,then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him,and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me,1,MAT.26
878,MAT,26,KJV,and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear,the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre,1,MAT.26
879,MAT,26,KJV,then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels,0,MAT.26
880,MAT,26,KJV,thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels,now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him,1,MAT.26
881,MAT,26,KJV,but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be,so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him ,1,MAT.26
882,MAT,26,KJV,in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me,i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me,0,MAT.26
883,MAT,26,KJV,i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me,all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you,1,MAT.26
884,MAT,26,KJV,but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled,then all the disciples forsook him and fled,0,MAT.26

1824,LUK,5,KJV,and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee,and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter,1,LUK.5
1825,LUK,5,KJV,and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies,this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work,1,LUK.5
1826,LUK,5,KJV,who can forgive sins but god alone,for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report,1,LUK.5
1827,LUK,5,KJV,but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason ye in your hearts,and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils and simon he surnamed peter and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house,1,LUK.5

1835,LUK,5,KJV,but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners,and jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick,0,LUK.5

1838,LUK,5,KJV,and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink,beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world,1,LUK.5

1939,LUK,7,KJV,now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner,he saith unto them how many loaves have ye,1,LUK.7
1940,LUK,7,KJV,and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee,and he saith master say on,0,LUK.7
1941,LUK,7,KJV,and he saith master say on,while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage,1,LUK.7

1948,LUK,7,KJV,i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head,thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet,0,LUK.7

1950,LUK,7,KJV,my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment,wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little,0,LUK.7
1951,LUK,7,KJV,wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little,and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven,0,LUK.7
1952,LUK,7,KJV,and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven,i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word,1,LUK.7
1953,LUK,7,KJV,and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also,then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,1,LUK.7
1954,LUK,7,KJV,and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace,and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils and joanna the wife of chuza herods steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance,0,LUK.7

1958,LUK,8,KJV,and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it,and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold,0,LUK.8
1959,LUK,8,KJV,and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold,and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one,1,LUK.8
1960,LUK,8,KJV,and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear,another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened,1,LUK.8
1961,LUK,8,KJV,and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be,and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand,0,LUK.8
1962,LUK,8,KJV,and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand,now the parable is this the seed is the word of god,0,LUK.8

1965,LUK,8,KJV,they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away,and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection,0,LUK.8
1966,LUK,8,KJV,and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection,and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,1,LUK.8
1967,LUK,8,KJV,but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience,i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted,1,LUK.8

1978,LUK,8,KJV,and he said unto them where is your faith,and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn,1,LUK.8
1979,LUK,8,KJV,and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him,and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost,1,LUK.8

2343,LUK,16,KJV,abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them,and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent,0,LUK.16
2344,LUK,16,KJV,and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent,as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so do ,1,LUK.16
2345,LUK,16,KJV,and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead,they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee,1,LUK.16
2346,LUK,17,KJV,then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones,take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him,0,LUK.17

2350,LUK,17,KJV,and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you,as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison,1,LUK.17
2351,LUK,17,KJV,but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat,and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink,0,LUK.17
2352,LUK,17,KJV,and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink,and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works,1,LUK.17
2353,LUK,17,KJV,doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him,and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it,1,LUK.17

2358,LUK,17,KJV,and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed,for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another,1,LUK.17
2359,LUK,17,KJV,and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan,this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven,1,LUK.17

2364,LUK,17,KJV,and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day,but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation,0,LUK.17

2369,LUK,17,KJV,even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed,in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back,0,LUK.17
2370,LUK,17,KJV,in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back,and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein,1,LUK.17

2423,LUK,19,KJV,and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear,he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return,0,LUK.19
2424,LUK,19,KJV,he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return,and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come,0,LUK.19
2425,LUK,19,KJV,and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come,but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us,0,LUK.19
2426,LUK,19,KJV,but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us,and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven,1,LUK.19
2427,LUK,19,KJV,and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading,blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him,1,LUK.19
2428,LUK,19,KJV,then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds,and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities,0,LUK.19
2429,LUK,19,KJV,and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities,and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds,0,LUK.19
2430,LUK,19,KJV,and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds,and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities,0,LUK.19
2431,LUK,19,KJV,and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities,and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many,1,LUK.19
2432,LUK,19,KJV,and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow,and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant,0,LUK.19
2433,LUK,19,KJV,and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant,thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury,0,LUK.19
2434,LUK,19,KJV,thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury,and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds,0,LUK.19
2435,LUK,19,KJV,and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds,and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him,0,LUK.19
2436,LUK,19,KJV,and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him,but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me,0,LUK.19
2437,LUK,19,KJV,but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me,and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death,1,LUK.19
2438,LUK,19,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem,there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another,1,LUK.19
2439,LUK,19,KJV,and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do ye loose him ,thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him,0,LUK.19
2440,LUK,19,KJV,thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him,and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them,0,LUK.19
2441,LUK,19,KJV,and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them,and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt,0,LUK.19
2442,LUK,19,KJV,and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt,but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young childs life,1,LUK.19
2443,LUK,19,KJV,and they said the lord hath need of him,when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left,1,LUK.19
2444,LUK,19,KJV,and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus thereon,and as he went they spread their clothes in the way,0,LUK.19
2445,LUK,19,KJV,and as he went they spread their clothes in the way,and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest,0,LUK.19
2446,LUK,19,KJV,and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest,and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples,0,LUK.19
2447,LUK,19,KJV,and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples,and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out,0,LUK.19
2448,LUK,19,KJV,and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out,and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves,1,LUK.19
2449,LUK,19,KJV,and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes,for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation,0,LUK.19
2450,LUK,19,KJV,for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation,and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves,0,LUK.19
2451,LUK,19,KJV,and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves,when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me,1,LUK.19
2452,LUK,19,KJV,and he taught daily in the temple,and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things,1,LUK.19
2453,LUK,19,KJV,but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him,and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things,0,LUK.19
2454,LUK,20,KJV,and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things,and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven,1,LUK.20
2455,LUK,20,KJV,or who is he that gave thee this authority,and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you,1,LUK.20
2456,LUK,20,KJV,and he answered and said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men,he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,1,LUK.20
2457,LUK,20,KJV,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not,but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet,0,LUK.20
2458,LUK,20,KJV,but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet,and they answered that they could not tell whence it was ,0,LUK.20
2459,LUK,20,KJV,and they answered that they could not tell whence it was ,watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come,1,LUK.20
2460,LUK,20,KJV,and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things,while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all,1,LUK.20
2461,LUK,20,KJV,then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time,and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty,0,LUK.20
2462,LUK,20,KJV,and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty,jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you,1,LUK.20
2463,LUK,20,KJV,and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty,and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant,1,LUK.20
2464,LUK,20,KJV,and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out,then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do,0,LUK.20
2465,LUK,20,KJV,then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do,after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter,1,LUK.20
2466,LUK,20,KJV,i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him,the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked him saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,1,LUK.20
2467,LUK,20,KJV,but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours,so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him ,0,LUK.20
2468,LUK,20,KJV,so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him ,what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them,0,LUK.20
2469,LUK,20,KJV,what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them,but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation,1,LUK.20
2470,LUK,20,KJV,he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others,but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word,1,LUK.20
2471,LUK,20,KJV,and when they heard it they said god forbid,then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days,1,LUK.20
2472,LUK,20,KJV,and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner,but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain,1,LUK.20
2473,LUK,20,KJV,whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder,and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone,1,LUK.20
2474,LUK,20,KJV,and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them,and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor,0,LUK.20
2475,LUK,20,KJV,and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor,and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life,1,LUK.20
2476,LUK,20,KJV,and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of god truly is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or no,but god raised him from the dead and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people,1,LUK.20
2477,LUK,20,KJV,but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them why tempt ye me,whose image and superscription hath it,0,LUK.20
2478,LUK,20,KJV,whose image and superscription hath it,but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world,1,LUK.20
2479,LUK,20,KJV,and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods,and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come,1,LUK.20
2480,LUK,20,KJV,and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace,then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,0,LUK.20
2481,LUK,20,KJV,then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children,0,LUK.20
2482,LUK,20,KJV,there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children,and the second took her to wife and he died childless,0,LUK.20
2483,LUK,20,KJV,and the second took her to wife and he died childless,and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof,1,LUK.20
2484,LUK,20,KJV,and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died,and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land,1,LUK.20
2485,LUK,20,KJV,last of all the woman died also,therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she,0,LUK.20
2486,LUK,20,KJV,therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she,for seven had her to wife,0,LUK.20
2487,LUK,20,KJV,for seven had her to wife,and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection,0,LUK.20
2488,LUK,20,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection,now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,0,LUK.20
2489,LUK,20,KJV,now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure,1,LUK.20
2490,LUK,20,KJV,for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him,then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said,0,LUK.20
2491,LUK,20,KJV,then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said,and after that they durst not ask him any question at all ,0,LUK.20
2492,LUK,20,KJV,and after that they durst not ask him any question at all ,and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did,1,LUK.20
2493,LUK,20,KJV,and he said unto them how say they that christ is davids son,and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,0,LUK.20
2494,LUK,20,KJV,and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you,1,LUK.20
2495,LUK,20,KJV,david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son,and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat,1,LUK.20
2496,LUK,20,KJV,then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation,and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury,0,LUK.20
2497,LUK,21,KJV,and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury,when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none,1,LUK.21
2498,LUK,21,KJV,and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites,and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had,0,LUK.21
2499,LUK,21,KJV,and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had,and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down,0,LUK.21
2500,LUK,21,KJV,and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down,and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be,0,LUK.21
2501,LUK,21,KJV,and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be,and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace,1,LUK.21
2502,LUK,21,KJV,and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass,the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water,1,LUK.21
2503,LUK,21,KJV,and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them,philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us,1,LUK.21

2505,LUK,21,KJV,then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven,and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore,1,LUK.21
2506,LUK,21,KJV,but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake,when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain,1,LUK.21
2507,LUK,21,KJV,and it shall turn to you for a testimony,but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me,1,LUK.21
2508,LUK,21,KJV,settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist,for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you,1,LUK.21

2586,LUK,22,KJV,and peter said man i am not,and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean,0,LUK.22
2587,LUK,22,KJV,and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean,but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you,1,LUK.22
2588,LUK,22,KJV,and peter said man i know not what thou sayest,for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,1,LUK.22

2590,LUK,22,KJV,and the lord turned and looked upon peter,and they answered that they could not tell whence it was ,1,LUK.22
2591,LUK,22,KJV,and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice,mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them,1,LUK.22
2592,LUK,22,KJV,and peter went out and wept bitterly,we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you,1,LUK.22
2593,LUK,22,KJV,and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him ,and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee,0,LUK.22
2594,LUK,22,KJV,and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee,put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,1,LUK.22
2595,LUK,22,KJV,and many other things blasphemously spake they against him,and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him,1,LUK.22
2596,LUK,22,KJV,and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying art thou the christ,and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go,0,LUK.22
2597,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go,hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god,0,LUK.22
2598,LUK,22,KJV,hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god,so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you,1,LUK.22
2599,LUK,22,KJV,then said they all art thou then the son of god,finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing,1,LUK.22
2600,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto them ye say that i am,and they said what need we any further witness,0,LUK.22
2601,LUK,22,KJV,and they said what need we any further witness,the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born,1,LUK.22
2602,LUK,22,KJV,for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth,and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate,0,LUK.22
2603,LUK,23,KJV,and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate,and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out,1,LUK.23
2604,LUK,23,KJV,and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king,and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews,0,LUK.23
2605,LUK,23,KJV,and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews,but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women,1,LUK.23
2606,LUK,23,KJV,and he answered him and said thou sayest it then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man,hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world,1,LUK.23
2607,LUK,23,KJV,and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place,when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean,0,LUK.23
2608,LUK,23,KJV,when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean,and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time,0,LUK.23
2609,LUK,23,KJV,and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time,for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time,1,LUK.23
2610,LUK,23,KJV,and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him,the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth,1,LUK.23
2611,LUK,23,KJV,then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing,and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him,0,LUK.23
2612,LUK,23,KJV,and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him,and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate,0,LUK.23
2613,LUK,23,KJV,and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate,for many are called but few are chosen,1,LUK.23
2614,LUK,23,KJV,and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves,they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee,1,LUK.23
2615,LUK,23,KJV,and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him,i will therefore chastise him and release him ,0,LUK.23
2616,LUK,23,KJV,i will therefore chastise him and release him ,the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole,1,LUK.23
2617,LUK,23,KJV,for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them,but they cried saying crucify him crucify him,0,LUK.23
2618,LUK,23,KJV,but they cried saying crucify him crucify him,and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber,1,LUK.23
2619,LUK,23,KJV,and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done,i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go,0,LUK.23
2620,LUK,23,KJV,i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go,and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified,0,LUK.23
2621,LUK,23,KJV,and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified,and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed,0,LUK.23
2622,LUK,23,KJV,and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed,greet them that love us in the faith,1,LUK.23
2623,LUK,23,KJV,and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required,and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,1,LUK.23
2624,LUK,23,KJV,and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will,but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him,1,LUK.23
2625,LUK,23,KJV,and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all,1,LUK.23
2626,LUK,23,KJV,and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him,but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,0,LUK.23
2627,LUK,23,KJV,but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck,0,LUK.23
2628,LUK,23,KJV,for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck,then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us,0,LUK.23
2629,LUK,23,KJV,then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us,he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red,1,LUK.23
2630,LUK,23,KJV,for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry,and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death,0,LUK.23
2631,LUK,23,KJV,and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death,and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey,1,LUK.23
2632,LUK,23,KJV,and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left,then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do,0,LUK.23
2633,LUK,23,KJV,then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do,and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes,1,LUK.23
2634,LUK,23,KJV,and they parted his raiment and cast lots,and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him,1,LUK.23
2635,LUK,23,KJV,and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god,and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself,0,LUK.23
2636,LUK,23,KJV,and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself,and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews,0,LUK.23
2637,LUK,23,KJV,and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews,but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear,1,LUK.23
2638,LUK,23,KJV,and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us,and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,1,LUK.23
2639,LUK,23,KJV,but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation,and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side,1,LUK.23
2640,LUK,23,KJV,and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss,and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom,0,LUK.23
2641,LUK,23,KJV,and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom,and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted,1,LUK.23
2642,LUK,23,KJV,and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it,1,LUK.23
2643,LUK,23,KJV,and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour,for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face,1,LUK.23
2644,LUK,23,KJV,and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst,but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours,1,LUK.23
2645,LUK,23,KJV,and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost,now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man,0,LUK.23
2646,LUK,23,KJV,now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man,and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven,1,LUK.23
2647,LUK,23,KJV,and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned,and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things,0,LUK.23
2648,LUK,23,KJV,and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things,now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would,1,LUK.23
2649,LUK,23,KJV,and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he was a good man and a just the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god,this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus,0,LUK.23
2650,LUK,23,KJV,this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus,but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation,1,LUK.23
2651,LUK,23,KJV,and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid,but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god,1,LUK.23
2652,LUK,23,KJV,and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on,when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it ,1,LUK.23
2653,LUK,23,KJV,and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid,and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment,0,LUK.23
2654,LUK,23,KJV,and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment,and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods,1,LUK.23
2701,JHN,1,KJV,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,the same was in the beginning with god,0,JHN.1
2702,JHN,1,KJV,the same was in the beginning with god,and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,1,JHN.1
2703,JHN,1,KJV,all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made,for by it the elders obtained a good report,1,JHN.1
2704,JHN,1,KJV,in him was life and the life was the light of men,and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night,1,JHN.1
2705,JHN,1,KJV,and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,0,JHN.1
2706,JHN,1,KJV,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born,1,JHN.1
2707,JHN,1,KJV,the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe,for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner,1,JHN.1
2708,JHN,1,KJV,he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light,some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calleth for elias,1,JHN.1
2709,JHN,1,KJV,that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not,0,JHN.1
2710,JHN,1,KJV,he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not,for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,1,JHN.1
2711,JHN,1,KJV,he came unto his own and his own received him not,but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house,1,JHN.1
2712,JHN,1,KJV,but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god,for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses,1,JHN.1
2713,JHN,1,KJV,and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth,therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word,1,JHN.1
2714,JHN,1,KJV,john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me,but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause,1,JHN.1
2715,JHN,1,KJV,and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace,for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ,0,JHN.1
2716,JHN,1,KJV,for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ,o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord,1,JHN.1
2717,JHN,1,KJV,no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou,for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers,1,JHN.1
2718,JHN,1,KJV,and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ,take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven,1,JHN.1
2719,JHN,1,KJV,and they asked him what then,and he saith i am not,0,JHN.1
2720,JHN,1,KJV,and he saith i am not,and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre,1,JHN.1
2721,JHN,1,KJV,and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou,and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full,1,JHN.1
2722,JHN,1,KJV,that we may give an answer to them that sent us,and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them,1,JHN.1
2723,JHN,1,KJV,he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet esaias,and they which were sent were of the pharisees,0,JHN.1
2724,JHN,1,KJV,and they which were sent were of the pharisees,and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet,0,JHN.1
2725,JHN,1,KJV,and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet,john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose,0,JHN.1
2726,JHN,1,KJV,john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose,but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names sake,1,JHN.1
2727,JHN,1,KJV,these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing,bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ,1,JHN.1
2728,JHN,1,KJV,the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world,also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god,1,JHN.1
2729,JHN,1,KJV,this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me,but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him,1,JHN.1
2730,JHN,1,KJV,and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water,and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy,1,JHN.1
2731,JHN,1,KJV,and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him,and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost,0,JHN.1
2732,JHN,1,KJV,and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost,and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god,0,JHN.1
2733,JHN,1,KJV,and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are christs and christ is gods,1,JHN.1
2734,JHN,1,KJV,again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus,and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day,1,JHN.1
2735,JHN,1,KJV,then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye,they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou,0,JHN.1
2736,JHN,1,KJV,they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou,he saith unto them come and see,0,JHN.1
2737,JHN,1,KJV,he saith unto them come and see,and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves,1,JHN.1
2738,JHN,1,KJV,they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour,for adam was first formed then eve,1,JHN.1
2739,JHN,1,KJV,one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother,truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds,1,JHN.1
2740,JHN,1,KJV,he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ,and he brought him to jesus,0,JHN.1
2741,JHN,1,KJV,and he brought him to jesus,and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone,0,JHN.1
2742,JHN,1,KJV,and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone,for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods,1,JHN.1
2743,JHN,1,KJV,the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me,and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh,1,JHN.1
2744,JHN,1,KJV,now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter,philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph,0,JHN.1
2745,JHN,1,KJV,philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph,and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth,0,JHN.1
2746,JHN,1,KJV,and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth,philip saith unto him come and see,0,JHN.1
2747,JHN,1,KJV,philip saith unto him come and see,then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned,1,JHN.1
2748,JHN,1,KJV,jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me,if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake,1,JHN.1
2749,JHN,1,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee,and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him,1,JHN.1
2750,JHN,1,KJV,nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel,then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me,1,JHN.1
2751,JHN,1,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou,thou shalt see greater things than these,0,JHN.1
2752,JHN,1,KJV,thou shalt see greater things than these,my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment,1,JHN.1
2753,JHN,1,KJV,and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away,1,JHN.1
2775,JHN,3,KJV,there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him,jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god,0,JHN.3
2776,JHN,3,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god,who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord,1,JHN.3
2777,JHN,3,KJV,nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old,can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born,0,JHN.3
2778,JHN,3,KJV,can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born,wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,1,JHN.3
2779,JHN,3,KJV,jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god,we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways,1,JHN.3
2780,JHN,3,KJV,that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit,i write unto you little children because ye have known the father,1,JHN.3
2781,JHN,3,KJV,marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again,and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever,1,JHN.3
2782,JHN,3,KJV,the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit,jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father,1,JHN.3
2783,JHN,3,KJV,nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be,jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things,0,JHN.3
2784,JHN,3,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things,verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness,0,JHN.3
2785,JHN,3,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness,this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming,1,JHN.3
2786,JHN,3,KJV,if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things,and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven,0,JHN.3
2787,JHN,3,KJV,and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven,and when they knew they say five and two fishes,1,JHN.3
2788,JHN,3,KJV,and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life,for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life,0,JHN.3
2789,JHN,3,KJV,for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life,and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable,1,JHN.3
2790,JHN,3,KJV,for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved,and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them,1,JHN.3
2791,JHN,3,KJV,he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god,and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,0,JHN.3
2792,JHN,3,KJV,and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved,0,JHN.3
2793,JHN,3,KJV,for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved,for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known,1,JHN.3
2794,JHN,3,KJV,but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god,this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john,1,JHN.3
2795,JHN,3,KJV,after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized,and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in,1,JHN.3
2796,JHN,3,KJV,and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized,for john was not yet cast into prison,0,JHN.3
2797,JHN,3,KJV,for john was not yet cast into prison,and are not his sisters here with us,1,JHN.3
2798,JHN,3,KJV,then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and the jews about purifying,and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife,1,JHN.3
2799,JHN,3,KJV,and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him,john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven,0,JHN.3
2800,JHN,3,KJV,john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven,ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him,0,JHN.3
2801,JHN,3,KJV,ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him,he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled,0,JHN.3
2802,JHN,3,KJV,he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled,and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name,1,JHN.3
2803,JHN,3,KJV,he must increase but i must decrease,then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him,1,JHN.3
2804,JHN,3,KJV,he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all,and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony,0,JHN.3
2805,JHN,3,KJV,and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony,and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil,1,JHN.3
2806,JHN,3,KJV,he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true,woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep,1,JHN.3
2807,JHN,3,KJV,for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him ,the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness,1,JHN.3
2808,JHN,3,KJV,the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand,he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him,0,JHN.3
2809,JHN,3,KJV,he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him,and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the ship mending their nets,1,JHN.3
2810,JHN,4,KJV,when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judaea and departed again into galilee,and he must needs go through samaria,0,JHN.4
2811,JHN,4,KJV,and he must needs go through samaria,then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph,0,JHN.4
2812,JHN,4,KJV,then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph,jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour,0,JHN.4
2813,JHN,4,KJV,jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour,and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power,1,JHN.4
2814,JHN,4,KJV,there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink,for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords,1,JHN.4
2815,JHN,4,KJV,for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria,for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans,0,JHN.4
2816,JHN,4,KJV,for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans,for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness,1,JHN.4
2817,JHN,4,KJV,jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water,but i speak this by permission and not of commandment,1,JHN.4
2818,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water,art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle,0,JHN.4
2819,JHN,4,KJV,art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle,and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre,1,JHN.4
2820,JHN,4,KJV,jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life,the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw,0,JHN.4
2821,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw,jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither,0,JHN.4
2822,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither,the woman answered and said i have no husband,0,JHN.4
2823,JHN,4,KJV,the woman answered and said i have no husband,jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly,0,JHN.4
2824,JHN,4,KJV,jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly,the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet,0,JHN.4
2825,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet,and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man,1,JHN.4
2826,JHN,4,KJV,our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship,have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another,1,JHN.4
2827,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father,and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name,1,JHN.4
2828,JHN,4,KJV,ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews,but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him,0,JHN.4
2829,JHN,4,KJV,but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him,afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee,1,JHN.4
2830,JHN,4,KJV,god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth,and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them,1,JHN.4
2831,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things,jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou,0,JHN.4
2832,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou,jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all,1,JHN.4
2833,JHN,4,KJV,or why talkest thou with her,the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ,0,JHN.4
2834,JHN,4,KJV,the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ,and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph,1,JHN.4
2835,JHN,4,KJV,then they went out of the city and came unto him,and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake,1,JHN.4
2836,JHN,4,KJV,in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat,but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of,0,JHN.4
2837,JHN,4,KJV,but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of,for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister,1,JHN.4
2838,JHN,4,KJV,therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat,jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work,0,JHN.4
2839,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work,say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest,0,JHN.4
2840,JHN,4,KJV,say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest,let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine,1,JHN.4
2841,JHN,4,KJV,behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest,afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed,1,JHN.4
2842,JHN,4,KJV,and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together,and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth,0,JHN.4
2843,JHN,4,KJV,and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth,i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours,0,JHN.4
2844,JHN,4,KJV,i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours,his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it ,1,JHN.4
2845,JHN,4,KJV,and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did,they answered him jesus of nazareth,1,JHN.4
2846,JHN,4,KJV,so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days,and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world,0,JHN.4
2847,JHN,4,KJV,and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world,for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty,1,JHN.4
2848,JHN,4,KJV,now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee,if this man were not of god he could do nothing,1,JHN.4
2849,JHN,4,KJV,for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness,1,JHN.4
2850,JHN,4,KJV,then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast,and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me,1,JHN.4
2851,JHN,4,KJV,so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine,and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell,1,JHN.4
2852,JHN,4,KJV,and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum,when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,0,JHN.4
2853,JHN,4,KJV,when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe,0,JHN.4
2854,JHN,4,KJV,then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe,the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die,0,JHN.4
2855,JHN,4,KJV,the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die,or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you,1,JHN.4
2856,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth,and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way,0,JHN.4
2857,JHN,4,KJV,and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way,knowing that it was the lord,1,JHN.4
2858,JHN,4,KJV,and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth,therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them,1,JHN.4
2859,JHN,4,KJV,then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend,and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him,0,JHN.4
2860,JHN,4,KJV,and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him,then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said,1,JHN.4
2861,JHN,4,KJV,so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house,this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee,0,JHN.4
2862,JHN,4,KJV,this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee,behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings houses,1,JHN.4
2863,JHN,5,KJV,after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem,it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life,1,JHN.5
2864,JHN,5,KJV,now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches,father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour,1,JHN.5
2865,JHN,5,KJV,in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,1,JHN.5
2866,JHN,5,KJV,for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had,and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years,0,JHN.5
2867,JHN,5,KJV,and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years,when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole,0,JHN.5
2868,JHN,5,KJV,when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole,in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water,1,JHN.5
2869,JHN,5,KJV,the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me,and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace,1,JHN.5
2870,JHN,5,KJV,jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk,and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight ,1,JHN.5
2871,JHN,5,KJV,and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath,the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed,0,JHN.5
2872,JHN,5,KJV,the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed,he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk,0,JHN.5
2873,JHN,5,KJV,he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk,then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk,0,JHN.5
2874,JHN,5,KJV,then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk,and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name,1,JHN.5
2875,JHN,5,KJV,and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place,and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene,1,JHN.5
2876,JHN,5,KJV,afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee,the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole,0,JHN.5
2877,JHN,5,KJV,the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole,and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day,0,JHN.5
2878,JHN,5,KJV,and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day,but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work,0,JHN.5
2879,JHN,5,KJV,but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work,therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god,0,JHN.5
2880,JHN,5,KJV,therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god,for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful,1,JHN.5
2881,JHN,5,KJV,then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise,for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel,0,JHN.5
2882,JHN,5,KJV,for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel,then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me,1,JHN.5
2883,JHN,5,KJV,for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will,and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed,1,JHN.5
2884,JHN,5,KJV,for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father,he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him,0,JHN.5
2885,JHN,5,KJV,he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him,and he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue,1,JHN.5
2886,JHN,5,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life,verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live,0,JHN.5
2887,JHN,5,KJV,verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live,jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham,1,JHN.5
2888,JHN,5,KJV,for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man,marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation,0,JHN.5
2889,JHN,5,KJV,marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation,i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me,0,JHN.5
2890,JHN,5,KJV,i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me,if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true,0,JHN.5
2891,JHN,5,KJV,if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true,then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience,1,JHN.5
2892,JHN,5,KJV,there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true,ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth,0,JHN.5
2893,JHN,5,KJV,ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth,wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues,1,JHN.5
2894,JHN,5,KJV,but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved,he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light,0,JHN.5
2895,JHN,5,KJV,he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light,but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me,0,JHN.5
2896,JHN,5,KJV,but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me,and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me,0,JHN.5
2897,JHN,5,KJV,and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me,ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape,0,JHN.5
2898,JHN,5,KJV,ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape,but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light,1,JHN.5
2899,JHN,5,KJV,and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not,but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ,1,JHN.5
2900,JHN,5,KJV,search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me,and ye will not come to me that ye might have life,0,JHN.5
2901,JHN,5,KJV,and ye will not come to me that ye might have life,the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly,1,JHN.5
2902,JHN,5,KJV,i receive not honour from men,but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you,0,JHN.5
2903,JHN,5,KJV,but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you,i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive,0,JHN.5
2904,JHN,5,KJV,i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive,then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison,1,JHN.5
2905,JHN,5,KJV,how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only,do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust,0,JHN.5
2906,JHN,5,KJV,do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust,they answered him jesus of nazareth,1,JHN.5
2907,JHN,5,KJV,for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me,but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words,0,JHN.5
2908,JHN,5,KJV,but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words,the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world,1,JHN.5
2909,JHN,6,KJV,after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias,and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased,0,JHN.6
2910,JHN,6,KJV,and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased,and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples,0,JHN.6
2911,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples,and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh,0,JHN.6
2912,JHN,6,KJV,and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh,but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me,1,JHN.6
2913,JHN,6,KJV,when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat,of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures,1,JHN.6
2914,JHN,6,KJV,and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do,philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little,0,JHN.6
2915,JHN,6,KJV,philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little,one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many,0,JHN.6
2916,JHN,6,KJV,one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many,and jesus said make the men sit down,0,JHN.6
2917,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus said make the men sit down,now there was much grass in the place,0,JHN.6
2918,JHN,6,KJV,now there was much grass in the place,and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us,1,JHN.6
2919,JHN,6,KJV,so the men sat down in number about five thousand,and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would,0,JHN.6
2920,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would,then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto,1,JHN.6
2921,JHN,6,KJV,when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost,therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten,0,JHN.6
2922,JHN,6,KJV,therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten,then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world,0,JHN.6
2923,JHN,6,KJV,then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world,when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone,0,JHN.6
2924,JHN,6,KJV,when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone,and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum,0,JHN.6
2925,JHN,6,KJV,and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum,and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things,1,JHN.6
2926,JHN,6,KJV,and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them,and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,0,JHN.6
2927,JHN,6,KJV,and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness,1,JHN.6
2928,JHN,6,KJV,so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid,but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid,0,JHN.6
2929,JHN,6,KJV,but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid,then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went,0,JHN.6
2930,JHN,6,KJV,then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went,the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus,0,JHN.6
2931,JHN,6,KJV,the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus,there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him,1,JHN.6
2932,JHN,6,KJV,and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither,and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him,1,JHN.6
2933,JHN,6,KJV,jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled,and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath,1,JHN.6
2934,JHN,6,KJV,labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed,but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law,1,JHN.6
2935,JHN,6,KJV,then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god,jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent,0,JHN.6
2936,JHN,6,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent,they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee,0,JHN.6
2937,JHN,6,KJV,they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee,and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought,1,JHN.6
2938,JHN,6,KJV,our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat,then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven,0,JHN.6
2939,JHN,6,KJV,then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven,for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world,0,JHN.6
2940,JHN,6,KJV,for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world,when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains let him which is on the house top not come down to take any thing out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes,1,JHN.6
2941,JHN,6,KJV,then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread,and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst,0,JHN.6
2942,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst,but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him,1,JHN.6
2943,JHN,6,KJV,but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not,when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it ,1,JHN.6
2944,JHN,6,KJV,all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out,for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me,0,JHN.6
2945,JHN,6,KJV,for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ,1,JHN.6
2946,JHN,6,KJV,and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day,and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood,1,JHN.6
2947,JHN,6,KJV,and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day,the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven,0,JHN.6
2948,JHN,6,KJV,the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven,and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know,0,JHN.6
2949,JHN,6,KJV,and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know,there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children,1,JHN.6
2950,JHN,6,KJV,how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven,jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves,0,JHN.6
2951,JHN,6,KJV,jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves,then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me,1,JHN.6
2952,JHN,6,KJV,no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day,let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six,1,JHN.6
2953,JHN,6,KJV,it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god,every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me,0,JHN.6
2954,JHN,6,KJV,every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me,not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father,0,JHN.6
2955,JHN,6,KJV,not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father,verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life,0,JHN.6
2956,JHN,6,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life,i am that bread of life,0,JHN.6
2957,JHN,6,KJV,i am that bread of life,your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead,0,JHN.6
2958,JHN,6,KJV,your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead,this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die,0,JHN.6
2959,JHN,6,KJV,this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die,i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world,0,JHN.6
2960,JHN,6,KJV,i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world,the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,0,JHN.6
2961,JHN,6,KJV,the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar,1,JHN.6
2962,JHN,6,KJV,then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you,the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever,1,JHN.6
2963,JHN,6,KJV,whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day,for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed,0,JHN.6
2964,JHN,6,KJV,for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed,he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him,0,JHN.6
2965,JHN,6,KJV,he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him,for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance,1,JHN.6
2966,JHN,6,KJV,as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me,for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified,1,JHN.6
2967,JHN,6,KJV,this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever,and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee,1,JHN.6
2968,JHN,6,KJV,these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum,and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,1,JHN.6
2969,JHN,6,KJV,many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it,we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways,1,JHN.6
2970,JHN,6,KJV,when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you,then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord,1,JHN.6
2971,JHN,6,KJV,what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before,then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable,1,JHN.6
2972,JHN,6,KJV,it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life,but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime,1,JHN.6
2973,JHN,6,KJV,but there are some of you that believe not,and they did so and made them all sit down,1,JHN.6
2974,JHN,6,KJV,for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him,afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed,1,JHN.6
2975,JHN,6,KJV,and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father,from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him,0,JHN.6
2976,JHN,6,KJV,from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him,then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away,0,JHN.6
2977,JHN,6,KJV,then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away,then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go,0,JHN.6
2978,JHN,6,KJV,then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go,and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace,1,JHN.6
2979,JHN,6,KJV,thou hast the words of eternal life,which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar,1,JHN.6
2980,JHN,6,KJV,and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god,jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil,0,JHN.6
2981,JHN,6,KJV,jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil,he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve,0,JHN.6
2982,JHN,6,KJV,he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve,for they were about five thousand men,1,JHN.6
3108,JHN,9,KJV,and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth,so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch,1,JHN.9
3109,JHN,9,KJV,and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind,for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her,1,JHN.9
3110,JHN,9,KJV,jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him,i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work,0,JHN.9
3111,JHN,9,KJV,i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world,0,JHN.9
3112,JHN,9,KJV,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world,when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing,0,JHN.9
3113,JHN,9,KJV,when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing,and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am,1,JHN.9
3114,JHN,9,KJV,the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged,and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover,1,JHN.9
3115,JHN,9,KJV,some said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he ,therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened,0,JHN.9
3116,JHN,9,KJV,therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened,wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all,1,JHN.9
3117,JHN,9,KJV,he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight,then said they unto him where is he,0,JHN.9
3118,JHN,9,KJV,then said they unto him where is he,and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,1,JHN.9
3119,JHN,9,KJV,they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind,and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes,0,JHN.9
3120,JHN,9,KJV,and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes,this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish,1,JHN.9
3121,JHN,9,KJV,then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight,and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying art thou the christ,1,JHN.9
3122,JHN,9,KJV,he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see,in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory,1,JHN.9
3123,JHN,9,KJV,therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day,others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles,0,JHN.9
3124,JHN,9,KJV,others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles,and there was a division among them,0,JHN.9
3125,JHN,9,KJV,and there was a division among them,they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes,0,JHN.9
3126,JHN,9,KJV,they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes,he said he is a prophet,0,JHN.9
3127,JHN,9,KJV,he said he is a prophet,but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,0,JHN.9
3128,JHN,9,KJV,but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward,1,JHN.9
3129,JHN,9,KJV,and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind,how then doth he now see,0,JHN.9
3130,JHN,9,KJV,how then doth he now see,his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself,0,JHN.9
3131,JHN,9,KJV,his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself,these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue,0,JHN.9
3132,JHN,9,KJV,these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue,it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god,1,JHN.9
3133,JHN,9,KJV,therefore said his parents he is of age ask him,and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit,1,JHN.9
3134,JHN,9,KJV,then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner,jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying,1,JHN.9
3135,JHN,9,KJV,he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see,then said they to him again what did he to thee,0,JHN.9
3136,JHN,9,KJV,then said they to him again what did he to thee,and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods,1,JHN.9
3137,JHN,9,KJV,he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again,dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation,1,JHN.9
3138,JHN,9,KJV,will ye also be his disciples,i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,1,JHN.9
3139,JHN,9,KJV,then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples,we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is,0,JHN.9
3140,JHN,9,KJV,we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is,for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god,1,JHN.9
3141,JHN,9,KJV,the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes,now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth,0,JHN.9
3142,JHN,9,KJV,now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth,since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind,0,JHN.9
3143,JHN,9,KJV,since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind,and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest,1,JHN.9
3144,JHN,9,KJV,if this man were not of god he could do nothing,they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us,0,JHN.9
3145,JHN,9,KJV,they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us,and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth,1,JHN.9
3146,JHN,9,KJV,jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god,wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days,1,JHN.9
3147,JHN,9,KJV,he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him,and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you,1,JHN.9
3148,JHN,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee,every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit,1,JHN.9
3149,JHN,9,KJV,and he said lord i believe,and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou,1,JHN.9
3150,JHN,9,KJV,and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind,and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also,0,JHN.9
3151,JHN,9,KJV,and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also,jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth,0,JHN.9
3152,JHN,9,KJV,jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth,and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet,1,JHN.9
3153,JHN,10,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber,but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep,0,JHN.10
3154,JHN,10,KJV,but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep,to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out,0,JHN.10
3155,JHN,10,KJV,to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out,men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day,1,JHN.10
3156,JHN,10,KJV,and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice,and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers,0,JHN.10
3157,JHN,10,KJV,and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers,this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them,0,JHN.10
3158,JHN,10,KJV,this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them,then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep,0,JHN.10
3159,JHN,10,KJV,then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep,and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom,1,JHN.10
3160,JHN,10,KJV,all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them,and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou,1,JHN.10
3161,JHN,10,KJV,i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture,then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium,1,JHN.10
3162,JHN,10,KJV,the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly,for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,1,JHN.10
3163,JHN,10,KJV,i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep,but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep,0,JHN.10
3164,JHN,10,KJV,but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep,the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep,0,JHN.10
3165,JHN,10,KJV,the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep,but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone,1,JHN.10
3166,JHN,10,KJV,i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine,as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep,0,JHN.10
3167,JHN,10,KJV,as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep,and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd,0,JHN.10
3168,JHN,10,KJV,and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd,whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven,1,JHN.10
3169,JHN,10,KJV,therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again,no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself,0,JHN.10
3170,JHN,10,KJV,no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself,notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice,1,JHN.10
3171,JHN,10,KJV,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again,and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught,1,JHN.10
3172,JHN,10,KJV,this commandment have i received of my father,there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings,0,JHN.10
3173,JHN,10,KJV,there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings,and he desired to see him,1,JHN.10

3175,JHN,10,KJV,others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil,and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind,1,JHN.10
3176,JHN,10,KJV,can a devil open the eyes of the blind,and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter,0,JHN.10
3177,JHN,10,KJV,and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter,and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch,0,JHN.10
3178,JHN,10,KJV,and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch,i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be,1,JHN.10
3179,JHN,10,KJV,then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt,and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him,1,JHN.10
3180,JHN,10,KJV,if thou be the christ tell us plainly,if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god,1,JHN.10
3181,JHN,10,KJV,jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me,therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them,1,JHN.10
3182,JHN,10,KJV,but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you,my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand,0,JHN.10
3183,JHN,10,KJV,my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand,my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand,0,JHN.10

3401,JHN,15,KJV,but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause,when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst,1,JHN.15
3402,JHN,15,KJV,but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning,then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk,1,JHN.15
3403,JHN,16,KJV,these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended,while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all,1,JHN.16

3411,JHN,16,KJV,and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged,for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman,1,JHN.16
3412,JHN,16,KJV,i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now,he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them,1,JHN.16
3413,JHN,16,KJV,howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come,and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter,1,JHN.16
3414,JHN,16,KJV,he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you,all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you,0,JHN.16
3415,JHN,16,KJV,all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you,a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father,0,JHN.16
3416,JHN,16,KJV,a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father,then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father,0,JHN.16
3417,JHN,16,KJV,then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father,but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience,1,JHN.16
3418,JHN,16,KJV,they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while,but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking,1,JHN.16
3419,JHN,16,KJV,we cannot tell what he saith,it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found,1,JHN.16
3420,JHN,16,KJV,now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me,for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ,1,JHN.16

3422,JHN,16,KJV,a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world,the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind neither as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock,1,JHN.16
3423,JHN,16,KJV,and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you,these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me,1,JHN.16
3424,JHN,16,KJV,and in that day ye shall ask me nothing,verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you,0,JHN.16

4053,ACT,14,KJV,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren,long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands,0,ACT.14
4054,ACT,14,KJV,long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands,but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles,0,ACT.14
4055,ACT,14,KJV,but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles,and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about and there they preached the gospel,0,ACT.14
4056,ACT,14,KJV,and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about and there they preached the gospel,and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men,1,ACT.14
4057,ACT,14,KJV,and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet,spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet,1,ACT.14
4058,ACT,14,KJV,and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men,and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker,0,ACT.14
4059,ACT,14,KJV,and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker,then the disciples went away again unto their own home,1,ACT.14
4060,ACT,14,KJV,then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people,which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things,0,ACT.14
4061,ACT,14,KJV,which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things,we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways,0,ACT.14
4062,ACT,14,KJV,we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways,for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh,1,ACT.14
4063,ACT,14,KJV,nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness,and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them,0,ACT.14
4064,ACT,14,KJV,and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them,and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god,1,ACT.14
4065,ACT,14,KJV,and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead,howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe,0,ACT.14
4066,ACT,14,KJV,howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe,and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb,1,ACT.14
4067,ACT,14,KJV,and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god,and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed,0,ACT.14
4068,ACT,14,KJV,and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed,but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus,1,ACT.14
4069,ACT,14,KJV,and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it,1,ACT.14
4070,ACT,14,KJV,and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled,and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him,1,ACT.14
4071,ACT,14,KJV,and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles,and there they abode long time with the disciples,0,ACT.14
4072,ACT,14,KJV,and there they abode long time with the disciples,the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved,1,ACT.14
4073,ACT,15,KJV,and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved,now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf,1,ACT.15
4074,ACT,15,KJV,when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question,then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you,1,ACT.15
4075,ACT,15,KJV,and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren,there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples,1,ACT.15
4076,ACT,15,KJV,and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them,now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done,1,ACT.15
4077,ACT,15,KJV,but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses,and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter,0,ACT.15
4078,ACT,15,KJV,and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter,i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left,1,ACT.15
4079,ACT,15,KJV,and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe,and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith,0,ACT.15
4080,ACT,15,KJV,and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith,mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate,1,ACT.15
4081,ACT,15,KJV,now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear,wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men,1,ACT.15
4082,ACT,15,KJV,but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they,then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them,0,ACT.15
4083,ACT,15,KJV,then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them,and after they had held their peace james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name,0,ACT.15

4085,ACT,15,KJV,and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things,known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world,0,ACT.15
4086,ACT,15,KJV,known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world,or thirsty and gave thee drink,1,ACT.15
4087,ACT,15,KJV,wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood,for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified,1,ACT.15
4088,ACT,15,KJV,for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day,and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,1,ACT.15
4089,ACT,15,KJV,then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ,and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more,1,ACT.15
4090,ACT,15,KJV,we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth,for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well,0,ACT.15

4223,ACT,19,KJV,wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another,for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government,1,ACT.19

4234,ACT,20,KJV,and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together,nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness,1,ACT.20
4235,ACT,20,KJV,and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead,and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out,1,ACT.20
4236,ACT,20,KJV,and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him,but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,1,ACT.20

4241,ACT,20,KJV,and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus,he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god,1,ACT.20
4242,ACT,20,KJV,for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost,and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church,0,ACT.20
4243,ACT,20,KJV,and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church,and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ,0,ACT.20

4246,ACT,20,KJV,but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god,for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth,1,ACT.20
4247,ACT,20,KJV,and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more,wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men ,0,ACT.20

4324,ACT,22,KJV,and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom,and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good,1,ACT.22
4325,ACT,22,KJV,and paul said but i was free born,but solomon built him an house,1,ACT.22
4326,ACT,22,KJV,then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him,and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,1,ACT.22
4327,ACT,22,KJV,on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them,and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day,0,ACT.22
4328,ACT,23,KJV,and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day,and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth,0,ACT.23
4329,ACT,23,KJV,and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth,then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law,0,ACT.23
4330,ACT,23,KJV,then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law,and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day,1,ACT.23
4331,ACT,23,KJV,and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest,and five of them were wise and five were foolish,1,ACT.23
4332,ACT,23,KJV,then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people,the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write,1,ACT.23
4333,ACT,23,KJV,but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question,if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand,1,ACT.23
4334,ACT,23,KJV,and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided,for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both,0,ACT.23
4335,ACT,23,KJV,for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both,and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil,1,ACT.23
4336,ACT,23,KJV,and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god,and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle,0,ACT.23
4337,ACT,23,KJV,and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle,but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house,1,ACT.23
4338,ACT,23,KJV,and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome,and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away,1,ACT.23
4339,ACT,23,KJV,and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul,and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy,0,ACT.23
4340,ACT,23,KJV,and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy,verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy,1,ACT.23
4341,ACT,23,KJV,and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul,now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him,0,ACT.23
4342,ACT,23,KJV,now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him,and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul,0,ACT.23
4343,ACT,23,KJV,and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul,for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead,1,ACT.23
4344,ACT,23,KJV,then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him,and they were glad and covenanted to give him money,1,ACT.23
4345,ACT,23,KJV,so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee,for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,1,ACT.23
4346,ACT,23,KJV,then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me,and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly,0,ACT.23
4347,ACT,23,KJV,and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly,let the woman learn in silence with all subjection,1,ACT.23
4348,ACT,23,KJV,but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee,for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard,1,ACT.23
4349,ACT,23,KJV,so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me,and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor,0,ACT.23
4350,ACT,23,KJV,and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor,and he wrote a letter after this manner claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting,0,ACT.23
4351,ACT,23,KJV,and he wrote a letter after this manner claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting,this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman,0,ACT.23
4352,ACT,23,KJV,this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman,howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep,1,ACT.23
4353,ACT,23,KJV,and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds,and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him,0,ACT.23
4354,ACT,23,KJV,and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him,for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,1,ACT.23
4355,ACT,23,KJV,then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris,on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him,0,ACT.23
4356,ACT,23,KJV,on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him,and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was,0,ACT.23
4357,ACT,23,KJV,and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was,but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god,1,ACT.23
4358,ACT,23,KJV,and when he understood that he was of cilicia i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come,and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall,0,ACT.23
4359,ACT,23,KJV,and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall,and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul,0,ACT.23
4360,ACT,24,KJV,and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul,and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness,0,ACT.24
4361,ACT,24,KJV,and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness,but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord,1,ACT.24
4362,ACT,24,KJV,notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words,for we have found this man pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law,0,ACT.24
4363,ACT,24,KJV,for we have found this man pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law,but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him,0,ACT.24
4364,ACT,24,KJV,but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him,and the jews also assented saying that these things were so,0,ACT.24
4365,ACT,24,KJV,and the jews also assented saying that these things were so,thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ,1,ACT.24
4366,ACT,24,KJV,then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship,and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me,0,ACT.24
4367,ACT,24,KJV,and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me,but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust,0,ACT.24
4368,ACT,24,KJV,but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust,and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa,1,ACT.24
4369,ACT,24,KJV,and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and toward men,for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him as many as had plagues,1,ACT.24
4370,ACT,24,KJV,now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings,whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult,0,ACT.24
4371,ACT,24,KJV,whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult,and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged,1,ACT.24
4372,ACT,24,KJV,who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me,but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe,1,ACT.24
4373,ACT,24,KJV,or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day,love not the world neither the things that are in the world,1,ACT.24
4374,ACT,24,KJV,and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter,and he said unto him why callest thou me good,1,ACT.24
4375,ACT,24,KJV,and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him,and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ,0,ACT.24
4376,ACT,24,KJV,and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ,but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil,1,ACT.24
4377,ACT,24,KJV,and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee,he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him,0,ACT.24
4378,ACT,24,KJV,he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him,those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you,1,ACT.24
4379,ACT,24,KJV,but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound,now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem,0,ACT.24
4380,ACT,25,KJV,now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem,i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth,1,ACT.25
4381,ACT,25,KJV,then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him,but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither ,0,ACT.25
4382,ACT,25,KJV,but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither ,then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord,1,ACT.25
4383,ACT,25,KJV,let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him,and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought,0,ACT.25
4384,ACT,25,KJV,and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought,and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove,0,ACT.25
4385,ACT,25,KJV,and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove,while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all,0,ACT.25
4386,ACT,25,KJV,while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all,but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me,0,ACT.25
4387,ACT,25,KJV,but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me,then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest,0,ACT.25
4388,ACT,25,KJV,then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest,and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man,1,ACT.25
4389,ACT,25,KJV,for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them,then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar,0,ACT.25
4390,ACT,25,KJV,then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar,and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god,1,ACT.25
4391,ACT,25,KJV,and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus,and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him,0,ACT.25
4392,ACT,25,KJV,and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him,can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born,1,ACT.25
4393,ACT,25,KJV,to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him,now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would,1,ACT.25
4394,ACT,25,KJV,therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth,against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive,0,ACT.25
4395,ACT,25,KJV,against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive,i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,1,ACT.25
4396,ACT,25,KJV,and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters,he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god,1,ACT.25
4397,ACT,25,KJV,but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar,then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself,0,ACT.25
4398,ACT,25,KJV,then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself,to morrow said he thou shalt hear him,0,ACT.25
4399,ACT,25,KJV,to morrow said he thou shalt hear him,and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth,0,ACT.25
4400,ACT,25,KJV,and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth,and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia,1,ACT.25
4401,ACT,25,KJV,and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer,but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him,0,ACT.25
4402,ACT,25,KJV,but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him,now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith,1,ACT.25
4403,ACT,25,KJV,of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord,wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write,0,ACT.25
4404,ACT,25,KJV,wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write,for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him,0,ACT.25
4405,ACT,25,KJV,for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him,when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter,1,ACT.25
4432,ACT,27,KJV,and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band,and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her ,1,ACT.27
4433,ACT,27,KJV,and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us,and the next day we touched at sidon,0,ACT.27
4434,ACT,27,KJV,and the next day we touched at sidon,it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak,1,ACT.27
4435,ACT,27,KJV,and julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself,and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him,1,ACT.27
4436,ACT,27,KJV,and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary,and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia,0,ACT.27
4437,ACT,27,KJV,and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia,but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose,1,ACT.27
4438,ACT,27,KJV,and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein,aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house,1,ACT.27
4439,ACT,27,KJV,and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea,now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives,0,ACT.27
4440,ACT,27,KJV,now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives,nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul,0,ACT.27
4441,ACT,27,KJV,nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul,and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west,0,ACT.27
4442,ACT,27,KJV,and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west,but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins,1,ACT.27
4443,ACT,27,KJV,and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete,but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon,0,ACT.27
4444,ACT,27,KJV,but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon,and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive,0,ACT.27
4445,ACT,27,KJV,and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive,and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven,0,ACT.27
4446,ACT,27,KJV,and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven,and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship,0,ACT.27

4565,ROM,4,KJV,and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised,and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath,1,ROM.4
4566,ROM,4,KJV,for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith,for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression,0,ROM.4
4567,ROM,4,KJV,for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression,therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were,0,ROM.4
4568,ROM,4,KJV,therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were,and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am,1,ROM.4
4569,ROM,4,KJV,who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be,a man clothed in soft raiment,1,ROM.4
4570,ROM,4,KJV,and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarahs womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform,and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness,0,ROM.4
4571,ROM,4,KJV,and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness,destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died,1,ROM.4
4572,ROM,4,KJV,now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification,therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god,0,ROM.4
4573,ROM,5,KJV,therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god,what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do,1,ROM.5
4574,ROM,5,KJV,and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us,and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them,1,ROM.5
4575,ROM,5,KJV,for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly,for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away,1,ROM.5
4576,ROM,5,KJV,for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die,but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us,0,ROM.5
4577,ROM,5,KJV,but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us,the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water,1,ROM.5
4578,ROM,5,KJV,much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him,for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life,0,ROM.5
4579,ROM,5,KJV,for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life,and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived,1,ROM.5
4580,ROM,5,KJV,and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement,and jesus said unto him thou sayest,1,ROM.5
4581,ROM,5,KJV,wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law,nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression who is the figure of him that was to come,0,ROM.5
4582,ROM,5,KJV,nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression who is the figure of him that was to come,take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him,1,ROM.5
4583,ROM,5,KJV,but not as the offence so also is the free gift,for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many,0,ROM.5
4584,ROM,5,KJV,for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many,and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justification,0,ROM.5
4585,ROM,5,KJV,and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justification,hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour,1,ROM.5
4586,ROM,5,KJV,for if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life,for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous,0,ROM.5
4587,ROM,5,KJV,for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous,moreover the law entered that the offence might abound,0,ROM.5
4588,ROM,5,KJV,moreover the law entered that the offence might abound,but where sin abounded grace did much more abound that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord,0,ROM.5
4589,ROM,5,KJV,but where sin abounded grace did much more abound that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord,shall we continue in sin that grace may abound,0,ROM.5
4590,ROM,6,KJV,shall we continue in sin that grace may abound,how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein,0,ROM.6
4591,ROM,6,KJV,how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein,ye are the light of the world,1,ROM.6
4592,ROM,6,KJV,know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death,blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame,1,ROM.6
4593,ROM,6,KJV,therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life,it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it,1,ROM.6
4594,ROM,6,KJV,for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin,for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known,1,ROM.6
4595,ROM,6,KJV,for he that is dead is freed from sin,now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him,0,ROM.6
4596,ROM,6,KJV,now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him,for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever,1,ROM.6
4597,ROM,6,KJV,for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god,but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask,1,ROM.6
4598,ROM,6,KJV,likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord,let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof,0,ROM.6
4599,ROM,6,KJV,let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof,neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god,0,ROM.6
4600,ROM,6,KJV,neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god,for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace,0,ROM.6
4601,ROM,6,KJV,for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace,shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace,0,ROM.6
4602,ROM,6,KJV,shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace,and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita,1,ROM.6
4603,ROM,6,KJV,know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness,but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar,1,ROM.6
4604,ROM,6,KJV,but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you,but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god,1,ROM.6
4605,ROM,6,KJV,being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness,so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre,1,ROM.6
4606,ROM,6,KJV,i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness,and he must needs go through samaria,1,ROM.6
4607,ROM,6,KJV,for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness,moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain,1,ROM.6
4608,ROM,6,KJV,what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed,and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life,1,ROM.6
4609,ROM,6,KJV,for the end of those things is death,but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life,0,ROM.6
4610,ROM,6,KJV,but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life,for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord,0,ROM.6
4611,ROM,6,KJV,for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord,for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you,1,ROM.6
4612,ROM,7,KJV,know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth,verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled,1,ROM.7
4613,ROM,7,KJV,for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband,so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man,0,ROM.7
4614,ROM,7,KJV,so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man,likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them,1,ROM.7
4615,ROM,7,KJV,wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god,for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,1,ROM.7
4616,ROM,7,KJV,for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death,for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken,1,ROM.7
4617,ROM,7,KJV,but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter,and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon,1,ROM.7
4618,ROM,7,KJV,nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet,and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am,1,ROM.7
4619,ROM,7,KJV,but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence,for without the law sin was dead,0,ROM.7
4620,ROM,7,KJV,for without the law sin was dead,and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear,1,ROM.7
4621,ROM,7,KJV,for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died,and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death,0,ROM.7
4622,ROM,7,KJV,and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death,for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me ,0,ROM.7
4623,ROM,7,KJV,for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me ,wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good,0,ROM.7
4624,ROM,7,KJV,wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good,was then that which is good made death unto me,0,ROM.7
4625,ROM,7,KJV,was then that which is good made death unto me,and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad,1,ROM.7
4626,ROM,7,KJV,but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin,0,ROM.7
4627,ROM,7,KJV,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin,and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand,1,ROM.7
4628,ROM,7,KJV,for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i,if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good,0,ROM.7
4629,ROM,7,KJV,if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good,but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified,1,ROM.7
4630,ROM,7,KJV,now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me,then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed,1,ROM.7
4631,ROM,7,KJV,for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not,for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do,0,ROM.7
4632,ROM,7,KJV,for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do,now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me,0,ROM.7
4633,ROM,7,KJV,now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me,i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me,0,ROM.7
4634,ROM,7,KJV,i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me,for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members,0,ROM.7
4635,ROM,7,KJV,for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members,jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god,1,ROM.7
4636,ROM,7,KJV,o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death,and the second time the cock crew,1,ROM.7
4637,ROM,7,KJV,i thank god through jesus christ our lord,then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium,1,ROM.7
4638,ROM,7,KJV,so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin,now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him,1,ROM.7
4639,ROM,8,KJV,there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit,by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went,1,ROM.8
4640,ROM,8,KJV,for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death,by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith,1,ROM.8
4641,ROM,8,KJV,for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit,and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required,1,ROM.8
4642,ROM,8,KJV,for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit,for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace,0,ROM.8
4643,ROM,8,KJV,for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace,because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be,0,ROM.8
4644,ROM,8,KJV,because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be,so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god,0,ROM.8
4645,ROM,8,KJV,so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god,now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him,1,ROM.8
4646,ROM,8,KJV,but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you,now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful,1,ROM.8
4647,ROM,8,KJV,now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his,and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness,0,ROM.8
4648,ROM,8,KJV,and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness,and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men,1,ROM.8
4649,ROM,8,KJV,but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you,therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh,0,ROM.8
4650,ROM,8,KJV,therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh,now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou,1,ROM.8
4651,ROM,8,KJV,for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live,for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me,1,ROM.8
4652,ROM,8,KJV,for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god,and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot,1,ROM.8
4653,ROM,8,KJV,for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father,and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be,1,ROM.8
4654,ROM,8,KJV,the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together,and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean,1,ROM.8
4655,ROM,8,KJV,for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god,0,ROM.8
4656,ROM,8,KJV,for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god,he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you,1,ROM.8
4657,ROM,8,KJV,for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god,and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two,1,ROM.8
4658,ROM,8,KJV,for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body,0,ROM.8
4659,ROM,8,KJV,and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body,for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for,0,ROM.8
4660,ROM,8,KJV,for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for,but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered,0,ROM.8
4661,ROM,8,KJV,but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered,for his life is taken from the earth,1,ROM.8
4662,ROM,8,KJV,and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god,and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth,1,ROM.8
4663,ROM,8,KJV,and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose,they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened,1,ROM.8
4664,ROM,8,KJV,for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren,for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought,1,ROM.8
4665,ROM,8,KJV,moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified,what shall we then say to these things,0,ROM.8
4666,ROM,8,KJV,what shall we then say to these things,if god be for us who can be against us,0,ROM.8
4667,ROM,8,KJV,if god be for us who can be against us,he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things,0,ROM.8
4668,ROM,8,KJV,he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things,who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect,0,ROM.8
4669,ROM,8,KJV,who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect,it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us,0,ROM.8
4670,ROM,8,KJV,it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us,for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision,1,ROM.8
4671,ROM,8,KJV,who shall separate us from the love of christ,shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,0,ROM.8
4672,ROM,8,KJV,shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people,1,ROM.8
4673,ROM,8,KJV,as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter,nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us,0,ROM.8
4674,ROM,8,KJV,nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us,for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord,0,ROM.8
4675,ROM,8,KJV,for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord,i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,0,ROM.8
4676,ROM,9,KJV,i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever,0,ROM.9
4677,ROM,9,KJV,for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever,not as though the word of god hath taken none effect,0,ROM.9
4678,ROM,9,KJV,not as though the word of god hath taken none effect,now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge,1,ROM.9
4679,ROM,9,KJV,for they are not all israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called,that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed,0,ROM.9
4680,ROM,9,KJV,that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed,and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread,1,ROM.9
4681,ROM,9,KJV,for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son,but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say,1,ROM.9
4682,ROM,9,KJV,and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger,from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus,1,ROM.9
4683,ROM,9,KJV,as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated,for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion,0,ROM.9
4684,ROM,9,KJV,for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion,so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy,0,ROM.9
4685,ROM,9,KJV,so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy,for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows,1,ROM.9
4686,ROM,9,KJV,for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth,forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage,1,ROM.9
4687,ROM,9,KJV,therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth,consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these,1,ROM.9
4688,ROM,9,KJV,thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault,for who hath resisted his will,0,ROM.9
4689,ROM,9,KJV,for who hath resisted his will,and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray,1,ROM.9

4691,ROM,9,KJV,shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus,so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy,1,ROM.9
4692,ROM,9,KJV,hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour,and he denied him saying woman i know him not,1,ROM.9
4693,ROM,9,KJV,what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles,and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth,1,ROM.9
4694,ROM,9,KJV,as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved,and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god,0,ROM.9
4695,ROM,9,KJV,and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god,esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth,0,ROM.9
4696,ROM,9,KJV,esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth,then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise,1,ROM.9
4697,ROM,9,KJV,and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha,for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully,1,ROM.9
4698,ROM,9,KJV,that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith,for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife,1,ROM.9
4699,ROM,9,KJV,but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness,for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus,1,ROM.9
4700,ROM,9,KJV,because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law,for they stumbled at that stumblingstone as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,0,ROM.9
4701,ROM,9,KJV,for they stumbled at that stumblingstone as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved,0,ROM.9
4702,ROM,10,KJV,brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved,which of you convinceth me of sin,1,ROM.10
4703,ROM,10,KJV,for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge,for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god,0,ROM.10
4704,ROM,10,KJV,for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god,and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified,1,ROM.10
4705,ROM,10,KJV,for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth,for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him,1,ROM.10
4706,ROM,10,KJV,for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them,and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god,1,ROM.10
4707,ROM,10,KJV,but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven,and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be,1,ROM.10
4708,ROM,10,KJV,that is to bring christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep,and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief,1,ROM.10
4709,ROM,10,KJV,that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it,the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved,0,ROM.10
4710,ROM,10,KJV,the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved,and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare,1,ROM.10
4711,ROM,10,KJV,for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,0,ROM.10
4712,ROM,10,KJV,for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him,0,ROM.10
4713,ROM,10,KJV,for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him,for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved,0,ROM.10
4714,ROM,10,KJV,for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved,when all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me,1,ROM.10
4715,ROM,10,KJV,how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed,and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard,0,ROM.10

4717,ROM,10,KJV,and how shall they hear without a preacher,wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded,1,ROM.10
4718,ROM,10,KJV,and how shall they preach except they be sent,having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh,1,ROM.10
4719,ROM,10,KJV,as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel,for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report,0,ROM.10
4720,ROM,10,KJV,for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report,so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god,0,ROM.10
4721,ROM,10,KJV,so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god,and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god,1,ROM.10

4723,ROM,10,KJV,yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world,but i say did not israel know,0,ROM.10
4724,ROM,10,KJV,but i say did not israel know,behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed,1,ROM.10
4725,ROM,10,KJV,first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation i will anger you,for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ,1,ROM.10
4726,ROM,10,KJV,but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me,but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people,0,ROM.10
4727,ROM,10,KJV,but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people,all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life,1,ROM.10
4764,ROM,12,KJV,i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service,and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god,0,ROM.12
4765,ROM,12,KJV,and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god,drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities,1,ROM.12
4766,ROM,12,KJV,for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith,whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day,1,ROM.12

4894,1CO,1,KJV,and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other,so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests,1,1CO.1
4895,1CO,1,KJV,for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect,for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god,0,1CO.1
4896,1CO,1,KJV,for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent,0,1CO.1

4900,1CO,1,KJV,for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe,for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god,0,1CO.1
4901,1CO,1,KJV,for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god,because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men,0,1CO.1
4902,1CO,1,KJV,because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men,for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence,0,1CO.1
4903,1CO,1,KJV,for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence,but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord,0,1CO.1
4904,1CO,1,KJV,but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord,and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see,1,1CO.1
4905,1CO,2,KJV,and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god,then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come,1,1CO.2
4906,1CO,2,KJV,for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified,o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord,1,1CO.2
4907,1CO,2,KJV,and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god,0,1CO.2
4908,1CO,2,KJV,and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god,but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ,1,1CO.2
4909,1CO,2,KJV,howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory,for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy,1,1CO.2
4910,1CO,2,KJV,but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him,if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities,1,1CO.2
4911,1CO,2,KJV,but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god,for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,0,1CO.2
4912,1CO,2,KJV,for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god,0,1CO.2
4913,1CO,2,KJV,even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god,0,1CO.2
4914,1CO,2,KJV,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god,which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual,0,1CO.2
4915,1CO,2,KJV,which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual,but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned,0,1CO.2
4916,1CO,2,KJV,but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned,and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him,1,1CO.2
4917,1CO,2,KJV,but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man,for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him,0,1CO.2
4918,1CO,2,KJV,for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him,but we have the mind of christ,0,1CO.2
4919,1CO,2,KJV,but we have the mind of christ,and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ,0,1CO.2
4920,1CO,3,KJV,and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ,i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able,0,1CO.3
4921,1CO,3,KJV,i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able,would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me,1,1CO.3
4922,1CO,3,KJV,for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men,for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal,0,1CO.3
4923,1CO,3,KJV,for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal,and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias,1,1CO.3
4924,1CO,3,KJV,who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man,i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase,0,1CO.3
4925,1CO,3,KJV,i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase,so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase,0,1CO.3
4926,1CO,3,KJV,so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase,and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye,1,1CO.3
4927,1CO,3,KJV,now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour,for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry ye are gods building,0,1CO.3
4928,1CO,3,KJV,for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry ye are gods building,and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head,1,1CO.3
4929,1CO,3,KJV,according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon,but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon,0,1CO.3
4930,1CO,3,KJV,but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon,for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ,0,1CO.3
4931,1CO,3,KJV,for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ,now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is,0,1CO.3
4932,1CO,3,KJV,now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is,sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth,1,1CO.3
4933,1CO,3,KJV,if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward,and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him,1,1CO.3
4934,1CO,3,KJV,if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire,know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you,0,1CO.3
4935,1CO,3,KJV,know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you,and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness,1,1CO.3
4936,1CO,3,KJV,if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are,wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire,1,1CO.3
4937,1CO,3,KJV,if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god,0,1CO.3
4938,1CO,3,KJV,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god,do we begin again to commend ourselves,1,1CO.3
4939,1CO,3,KJV,for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness,wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator,1,1CO.3
4940,1CO,3,KJV,and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain,therefore let no man glory in men,0,1CO.3
4941,1CO,3,KJV,therefore let no man glory in men,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are christs and christ is gods,0,1CO.3
4942,1CO,3,KJV,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are christs and christ is gods,let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god,0,1CO.3
4964,1CO,5,KJV,it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife,and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you,0,1CO.5
4965,1CO,5,KJV,and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you,and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not,1,1CO.5
4966,1CO,5,KJV,for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus,for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many,1,1CO.5
4967,1CO,5,KJV,know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened,0,1CO.5
4968,1CO,5,KJV,purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened,and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people,1,1CO.5
4969,1CO,5,KJV,for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world,0,1CO.5
4970,1CO,5,KJV,i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world,salute one another with an holy kiss,1,1CO.5
4971,1CO,5,KJV,but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat,but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,1,1CO.5
4972,1CO,5,KJV,for what have i to do to judge them also that are without,is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own,1,1CO.5
4973,1CO,5,KJV,do not ye judge them that are within,but them that are without god judgeth,0,1CO.5
4974,1CO,5,KJV,but them that are without god judgeth,and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will,1,1CO.5
4975,1CO,5,KJV,therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person,dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints,0,1CO.5
5004,1CO,7,KJV,now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman,nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband,0,1CO.7
5005,1CO,7,KJV,nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband,fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known,1,1CO.7
5006,1CO,7,KJV,let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband,the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife,0,1CO.7
5007,1CO,7,KJV,the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife,for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him,1,1CO.7
5008,1CO,7,KJV,defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency,for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil,1,1CO.7
5009,1CO,7,KJV,but i speak this by permission and not of commandment,for i would that all men were even as i myself,0,1CO.7
5010,1CO,7,KJV,for i would that all men were even as i myself,but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,1,1CO.7
5011,1CO,7,KJV,but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that,i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i,0,1CO.7
5012,1CO,7,KJV,i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i,but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn,0,1CO.7
5013,1CO,7,KJV,but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn,and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife,0,1CO.7
5014,1CO,7,KJV,and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife,and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought,1,1CO.7
5015,1CO,7,KJV,but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away,for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father,1,1CO.7
5016,1CO,7,KJV,and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him,for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy,0,1CO.7
5017,1CO,7,KJV,for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy,but what went ye out for to see,1,1CO.7
5018,1CO,7,KJV,but if the unbelieving depart let him depart,and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans,1,1CO.7
5019,1CO,7,KJV,a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace,and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee,1,1CO.7
5020,1CO,7,KJV,for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband,if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son,1,1CO.7
5021,1CO,7,KJV,or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife,but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk,0,1CO.7
5022,1CO,7,KJV,but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk,and so ordain i in all churches,0,1CO.7
5023,1CO,7,KJV,and so ordain i in all churches,is any man called being circumcised,0,1CO.7
5024,1CO,7,KJV,is any man called being circumcised,so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen,1,1CO.7
5025,1CO,7,KJV,circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god,and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus,1,1CO.7
5026,1CO,7,KJV,let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called,and the second took her to wife and he died childless,1,1CO.7
5027,1CO,7,KJV,art thou called being a servant,care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather,0,1CO.7
5028,1CO,7,KJV,care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather,for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant,0,1CO.7
5029,1CO,7,KJV,for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant,ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men,0,1CO.7
5030,1CO,7,KJV,ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men,but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee,1,1CO.7
5031,1CO,7,KJV,brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god,now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful,0,1CO.7
5032,1CO,7,KJV,now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful,they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them,1,1CO.7
5033,1CO,7,KJV,i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be,art thou bound unto a wife,0,1CO.7
5034,1CO,7,KJV,art thou bound unto a wife,for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens,1,1CO.7
5035,1CO,7,KJV,art thou loosed from a wife,and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another,1,1CO.7
5036,1CO,7,KJV,but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned,nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you,0,1CO.7
5037,1CO,7,KJV,nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you,but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away,0,1CO.7
5038,1CO,7,KJV,but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away,and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood,1,1CO.7
5039,1CO,7,KJV,but i would have you without carefulness,now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse,1,1CO.7
5040,1CO,7,KJV,he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife,nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love,1,1CO.7
5041,1CO,7,KJV,there is difference also between a wife and a virgin,and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus,1,1CO.7
5042,1CO,7,KJV,the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband,and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction,0,1CO.7
5043,1CO,7,KJV,and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction,but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry,0,1CO.7
5044,1CO,7,KJV,but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry,and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place,1,1CO.7
5045,1CO,7,KJV,nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well,when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee,1,1CO.7
5046,1CO,7,KJV,so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better,and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch,1,1CO.7
5047,1CO,7,KJV,the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord,his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry,1,1CO.7
5048,1CO,7,KJV,but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god,and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece,1,1CO.7
5093,1CO,10,KJV,moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ,sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many,1,1CO.10
5094,1CO,10,KJV,but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness,now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted,0,1CO.10
5095,1CO,10,KJV,now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted,neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play,0,1CO.10
5096,1CO,10,KJV,neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play,neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand,0,1CO.10
5097,1CO,10,KJV,neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand,now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us,1,1CO.10
5098,1CO,10,KJV,neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents,neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer,0,1CO.10
5099,1CO,10,KJV,neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer,therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him,1,1CO.10
5100,1CO,10,KJV,now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come,i am that bread of life,1,1CO.10
5101,1CO,10,KJV,wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry,0,1CO.10
5102,1CO,10,KJV,there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry,i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say,0,1CO.10
5103,1CO,10,KJV,i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say,the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ,0,1CO.10
5104,1CO,10,KJV,the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ,verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy,1,1CO.10
5105,1CO,10,KJV,the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ,unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever,1,1CO.10
5106,1CO,10,KJV,for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread,behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar,0,1CO.10
5107,1CO,10,KJV,behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar,and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine,1,1CO.10
5108,1CO,10,KJV,that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing,bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,1,1CO.10
5109,1CO,10,KJV,but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils,and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed,1,1CO.10
5110,1CO,10,KJV,ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils,do we provoke the lord to jealousy,0,1CO.10
5111,1CO,10,KJV,do we provoke the lord to jealousy,and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou clean,1,1CO.10
5112,1CO,10,KJV,all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not,let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof,0,1CO.10
5113,1CO,10,KJV,let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof,greet one another with an holy kiss,1,1CO.10
5114,1CO,10,KJV,if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake,and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not,1,1CO.10
5115,1CO,10,KJV,but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience,he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked,1,1CO.10
5116,1CO,10,KJV,for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks,others said this is the christ,1,1CO.10
5117,1CO,10,KJV,whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god,1,1CO.10
5118,1CO,10,KJV,give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved,be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ,0,1CO.10
5119,1CO,11,KJV,be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ,now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you,0,1CO.11
5120,1CO,11,KJV,now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you,and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened,1,1CO.11
5121,1CO,11,KJV,but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god,and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee,1,1CO.11
5122,1CO,11,KJV,every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head,but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven,0,1CO.11
5123,1CO,11,KJV,but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven,for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered,0,1CO.11
5124,1CO,11,KJV,for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered,for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man,0,1CO.11
5125,1CO,11,KJV,for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man,and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes,1,1CO.11
5126,1CO,11,KJV,for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man,neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man,0,1CO.11
5127,1CO,11,KJV,neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man,for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels,0,1CO.11
5128,1CO,11,KJV,for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels,and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker,1,1CO.11
5129,1CO,11,KJV,nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord,and he said how can i except some man should guide me,1,1CO.11
5130,1CO,11,KJV,for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god,judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered,0,1CO.11
5131,1CO,11,KJV,judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered,jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me,1,1CO.11
5132,1CO,11,KJV,doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him,the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning,1,1CO.11
5133,1CO,11,KJV,but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering,but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god,0,1CO.11
5134,1CO,11,KJV,but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god,now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse,0,1CO.11
5135,1CO,11,KJV,now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse,for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law,1,1CO.11
5136,1CO,11,KJV,for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it,and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods,1,1CO.11
5137,1CO,11,KJV,for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you,and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt,1,1CO.11
5138,1CO,11,KJV,when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lords supper,for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken,0,1CO.11
5139,1CO,11,KJV,for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken,have ye not houses to eat and to drink in,0,1CO.11
5140,1CO,11,KJV,have ye not houses to eat and to drink in,or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not,0,1CO.11
5141,1CO,11,KJV,or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not,what shall i say to you,0,1CO.11
5142,1CO,11,KJV,what shall i say to you,shall i praise you in this,0,1CO.11
5143,1CO,11,KJV,shall i praise you in this,and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not,1,1CO.11
5144,1CO,11,KJV,for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me,after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me,0,1CO.11
5145,1CO,11,KJV,after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me,and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink,1,1CO.11
5146,1CO,11,KJV,for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come,and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god,1,1CO.11
5147,1CO,11,KJV,wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord,but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup,0,1CO.11
5148,1CO,11,KJV,but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup,for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body,0,1CO.11
5149,1CO,11,KJV,for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body,then said they unto him who art thou,1,1CO.11
5150,1CO,11,KJV,for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep,for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged,0,1CO.11
5151,1CO,11,KJV,for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged,but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world,0,1CO.11
5152,1CO,11,KJV,but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world,it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick,1,1CO.11
5153,1CO,11,KJV,wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another,and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant,1,1CO.11
5154,1CO,11,KJV,and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation,then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine,1,1CO.11
5155,1CO,11,KJV,and the rest will i set in order when i come,now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant,0,1CO.11
5156,1CO,12,KJV,now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant,so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee,1,1CO.12
5157,1CO,12,KJV,ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led,if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha,1,1CO.12
5158,1CO,12,KJV,wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost,and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought,1,1CO.12
5159,1CO,12,KJV,now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit,and there are differences of administrations but the same lord,0,1CO.12
5160,1CO,12,KJV,and there are differences of administrations but the same lord,and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all,0,1CO.12
5161,1CO,12,KJV,and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all,and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid,1,1CO.12
5162,1CO,12,KJV,but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal,by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand,1,1CO.12
5163,1CO,12,KJV,for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will,for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ,0,1CO.12
5164,1CO,12,KJV,for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ,jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon,1,1CO.12
5165,1CO,12,KJV,for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit,then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life,1,1CO.12
5166,1CO,12,KJV,for the body is not one member but many,and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him,1,1CO.12
5167,1CO,12,KJV,if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body,then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham,1,1CO.12
5168,1CO,12,KJV,and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body,for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me,1,1CO.12
5169,1CO,12,KJV,if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing,if the whole were hearing where were the smelling,0,1CO.12
5170,1CO,12,KJV,if the whole were hearing where were the smelling,but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him,0,1CO.12
5171,1CO,12,KJV,but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him,pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him,1,1CO.12
5172,1CO,12,KJV,and if they were all one member where were the body,but now are they many members yet but one body,0,1CO.12
5173,1CO,12,KJV,but now are they many members yet but one body,and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you,0,1CO.12
5174,1CO,12,KJV,and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you,and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings,1,1CO.12
5175,1CO,12,KJV,nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness,for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another,0,1CO.12
5176,1CO,12,KJV,for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another,then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake,1,1CO.12
5177,1CO,12,KJV,and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it,now ye are the body of christ and members in particular,0,1CO.12
5178,1CO,12,KJV,now ye are the body of christ and members in particular,so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him,1,1CO.12
5179,1CO,12,KJV,and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues,and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning,1,1CO.12
5180,1CO,12,KJV,have all the gifts of healing,but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way,0,1CO.12
5181,1CO,12,KJV,but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way,though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal,0,1CO.12
5192,1CO,14,KJV,follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy,if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,1,1CO.14
5193,1CO,14,KJV,for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries,but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort,0,1CO.14
5194,1CO,14,KJV,but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort,he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church,0,1CO.14
5195,1CO,14,KJV,he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church,and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read,1,1CO.14
5196,1CO,14,KJV,i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying,now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine,0,1CO.14
5197,1CO,14,KJV,now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine,and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped,0,1CO.14
5198,1CO,14,KJV,and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped,and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest,1,1CO.14
5199,1CO,14,KJV,for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle,and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn,1,1CO.14
5200,1CO,14,KJV,so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken,and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread,1,1CO.14
5201,1CO,14,KJV,for ye shall speak into the air,but i would have you without carefulness,1,1CO.14
5202,1CO,14,KJV,there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification,if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides,1,1CO.14
5203,1CO,14,KJV,therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me,so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first,1,1CO.14
5204,1CO,14,KJV,even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church,wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret,0,1CO.14
5205,1CO,14,KJV,wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret,he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you,1,1CO.14
5206,1CO,14,KJV,for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful,if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them,1,1CO.14
5207,1CO,14,KJV,i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also,but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom,1,1CO.14
5208,1CO,14,KJV,else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest,for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified,0,1CO.14
5209,1CO,14,KJV,for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified,i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue,0,1CO.14
5210,1CO,14,KJV,i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue,brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men,0,1CO.14
5211,1CO,14,KJV,brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men,in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord,0,1CO.14
5212,1CO,14,KJV,in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord,for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error,1,1CO.14
5213,1CO,14,KJV,wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe,for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead,1,1CO.14
5214,1CO,14,KJV,if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad,and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me,1,1CO.14
5215,1CO,14,KJV,but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth,then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people,1,1CO.14
5216,1CO,14,KJV,when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation,and his disciples heard it and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple,1,1CO.14
5217,1CO,14,KJV,let all things be done unto edifying,and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country,1,1CO.14
5218,1CO,14,KJV,if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret,but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god,0,1CO.14
5219,1CO,14,KJV,but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god,let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge,0,1CO.14
5220,1CO,14,KJV,let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge,the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause,1,1CO.14
5221,1CO,14,KJV,if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace,and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass,1,1CO.14
5222,1CO,14,KJV,for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted,and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,0,1CO.14
5223,1CO,14,KJV,and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,is he not also of the gentiles,1,1CO.14
5224,1CO,14,KJV,for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints,let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law,0,1CO.14
5225,1CO,14,KJV,let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law,and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church,0,1CO.14
5226,1CO,14,KJV,and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church,came the word of god out from you,0,1CO.14
5227,1CO,14,KJV,came the word of god out from you,and he said young man i say unto thee arise,1,1CO.14
5228,1CO,14,KJV,or came it unto you only,i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase,1,1CO.14
5229,1CO,14,KJV,if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord,but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant,0,1CO.14
5230,1CO,14,KJV,but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant,have ye your heart yet hardened,1,1CO.14
5231,1CO,14,KJV,wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues,let all things be done decently and in order,0,1CO.14
5232,1CO,14,KJV,let all things be done decently and in order,know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whom if he come shortly i will see you,1,1CO.14
5287,1CO,16,KJV,now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye,when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha,1,1CO.16
5288,1CO,16,KJV,upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come,have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another,1,1CO.16
5289,1CO,16,KJV,and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem,and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,1,1CO.16
5290,1CO,16,KJV,and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me,for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,1,1CO.16
5291,1CO,16,KJV,now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia,and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go,0,1CO.16

5359,2CO,4,KJV,for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake,for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ,0,2CO.4
5360,2CO,4,KJV,for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ,but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us,0,2CO.4

5366,2CO,4,KJV,for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god,the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican,1,2CO.4
5367,2CO,4,KJV,for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day,and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me,1,2CO.4
5368,2CO,4,KJV,for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal,for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,0,2CO.4
5385,2CO,6,KJV,we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain,for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things,0,2CO.6
5386,2CO,6,KJV,for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things,and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i,1,2CO.6
5387,2CO,6,KJV,o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged,therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works,1,2CO.6
5388,2CO,6,KJV,ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels,now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged,0,2CO.6
5389,2CO,6,KJV,now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged,but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep,1,2CO.6
5390,2CO,6,KJV,be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness,and what communion hath light with darkness,0,2CO.6
5391,2CO,6,KJV,and what communion hath light with darkness,but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles,1,2CO.6
5392,2CO,6,KJV,and what concord hath christ with belial,and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world,1,2CO.6
5393,2CO,6,KJV,or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel,and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols,0,2CO.6
5394,2CO,6,KJV,and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols,for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,1,2CO.6
5395,2CO,6,KJV,for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people,wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty,0,2CO.6
5396,2CO,6,KJV,wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,0,2CO.6
5412,2CO,8,KJV,moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality,for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints,0,2CO.8
5413,2CO,8,KJV,for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints,and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god,0,2CO.8
5414,2CO,8,KJV,and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god,and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not,1,2CO.8
5415,2CO,8,KJV,insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also,but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life,1,2CO.8
5416,2CO,8,KJV,therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also,and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him,1,2CO.8
5417,2CO,8,KJV,i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love,but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak,1,2CO.8
5418,2CO,8,KJV,for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich,and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago,0,2CO.8
5419,2CO,8,KJV,and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago,then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him,1,2CO.8
5420,2CO,8,KJV,now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have,for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not,0,2CO.8
5421,2CO,8,KJV,for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not,then pilate commanded the body to be delivered,1,2CO.8
5422,2CO,8,KJV,for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack,while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light,1,2CO.8
5423,2CO,8,KJV,but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you,for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you,0,2CO.8
5424,2CO,8,KJV,for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you,and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men,0,2CO.8
5425,2CO,8,KJV,and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men,and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you,0,2CO.8
5426,2CO,8,KJV,and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you,so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory,1,2CO.8
5427,2CO,8,KJV,whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ,cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also,1,2CO.8
5428,2CO,8,KJV,wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf,and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and toward men,1,2CO.8
5429,2CO,9,KJV,for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many,yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting,0,2CO.9
5430,2CO,9,KJV,yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting,therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness,0,2CO.9
5431,2CO,9,KJV,therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness,but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully,0,2CO.9
5432,2CO,9,KJV,but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully,every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver,0,2CO.9
5433,2CO,9,KJV,every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver,servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free,1,2CO.9
5434,2CO,9,KJV,and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever,now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god,0,2CO.9
5435,2CO,9,KJV,now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god,for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you,0,2CO.9
5436,2CO,9,KJV,for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you,thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift,0,2CO.9
5437,2CO,9,KJV,thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift,now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh,0,2CO.9
5438,2CO,10,KJV,now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh,for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled,0,2CO.10
5439,2CO,10,KJV,for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled,verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled,1,2CO.10
5440,2CO,10,KJV,do ye look on things after the outward appearance,and after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles,1,2CO.10
5441,2CO,10,KJV,if any man trust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think this again that as he is christs even so are we christs,for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry,1,2CO.10
5442,2CO,10,KJV,for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters,for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible,0,2CO.10
5443,2CO,10,KJV,for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him,1,2CO.10
5444,2CO,10,KJV,let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present,for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise,0,2CO.10
5445,2CO,10,KJV,for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise,and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude,1,2CO.10
5446,2CO,10,KJV,but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you,then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship,1,2CO.10
5447,2CO,10,KJV,for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ not boasting of things without our measure that is of other mens labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our hand,but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord,0,2CO.10
5448,2CO,10,KJV,but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord,and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand,1,2CO.10
5449,2CO,10,KJV,for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth,now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work,1,2CO.10
5450,2CO,11,KJV,would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me,but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not ,1,2CO.11
5451,2CO,11,KJV,for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ,but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ,0,2CO.11
5452,2CO,11,KJV,but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ,for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him ,0,2CO.11
5453,2CO,11,KJV,for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him ,for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles,0,2CO.11
5454,2CO,11,KJV,for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles,but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things,0,2CO.11
5455,2CO,11,KJV,but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things,have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely,0,2CO.11
5456,2CO,11,KJV,have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely,i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service,0,2CO.11
5457,2CO,11,KJV,i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service,even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel,1,2CO.11
5458,2CO,11,KJV,and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself ,but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee,1,2CO.11
5459,2CO,11,KJV,as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia,but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we,0,2CO.11
5460,2CO,11,KJV,but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we,whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more,1,2CO.11
5461,2CO,11,KJV,for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,1,2CO.11
5462,2CO,11,KJV,and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light,therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works,0,2CO.11
5463,2CO,11,KJV,therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works,and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea,1,2CO.11
5464,2CO,11,KJV,i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little,he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again,1,2CO.11
5465,2CO,11,KJV,that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting,and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken,1,2CO.11
5466,2CO,11,KJV,seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also,for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise,0,2CO.11
5467,2CO,11,KJV,for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise,and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice,1,2CO.11
5468,2CO,11,KJV,for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face,i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak,0,2CO.11
5469,2CO,11,KJV,i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak,howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also,0,2CO.11
5470,2CO,11,KJV,howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all,1,2CO.11
5471,2CO,11,KJV,are they the seed of abraham,and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear,1,2CO.11
5472,2CO,11,KJV,i speak as a fool i am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft,of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one,0,2CO.11
5473,2CO,11,KJV,of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one,and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon,1,2CO.11
5474,2CO,11,KJV,thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness,beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches,0,2CO.11
5475,2CO,11,KJV,beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches,who is weak and i am not weak,0,2CO.11
5476,2CO,11,KJV,who is weak and i am not weak,who is offended and i burn not,0,2CO.11
5477,2CO,11,KJV,who is offended and i burn not,and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid,1,2CO.11
5478,2CO,11,KJV,if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities,the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not,0,2CO.11
5479,2CO,11,KJV,the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not,in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands,0,2CO.11
5480,2CO,11,KJV,in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands,it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory,0,2CO.11
5481,2CO,12,KJV,it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory,it was written to the philippians from rome by epaphroditus,1,2CO.12
5482,2CO,12,KJV,i will come to visions and revelations of the lord,i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven,0,2CO.12
5483,2CO,12,KJV,i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven,and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them,1,2CO.12
5484,2CO,12,KJV,and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women,1,2CO.12
5485,2CO,12,KJV,of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities,for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me,0,2CO.12
5486,2CO,12,KJV,for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me,and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure,0,2CO.12
5487,2CO,12,KJV,and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure,for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me,0,2CO.12
5488,2CO,12,KJV,for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me,and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness,0,2CO.12
5489,2CO,12,KJV,and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness,and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves,1,2CO.12
5490,2CO,12,KJV,most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me,therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong,0,2CO.12
5491,2CO,12,KJV,therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong,they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory,1,2CO.12
5492,2CO,12,KJV,i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing,john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose,1,2CO.12
5493,2CO,12,KJV,truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds,for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you,0,2CO.12
5494,2CO,12,KJV,for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you,jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day,1,2CO.12
5495,2CO,12,KJV,behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children,to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices,1,2CO.12
5496,2CO,12,KJV,and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved,so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen,1,2CO.12
5497,2CO,12,KJV,but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile,did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you,0,2CO.12
5498,2CO,12,KJV,did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you,i desired titus and with him i sent a brother,0,2CO.12
5499,2CO,12,KJV,i desired titus and with him i sent a brother,but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you,1,2CO.12
5500,2CO,12,KJV,did titus make a gain of you,walked we not in the same spirit,0,2CO.12
5501,2CO,12,KJV,walked we not in the same spirit,walked we not in the same steps,0,2CO.12
5502,2CO,12,KJV,walked we not in the same steps,and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened,1,2CO.12
5503,2CO,12,KJV,again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you,for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake,1,2CO.12
5504,2CO,12,KJV,we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying,for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed,0,2CO.12
5505,2CO,12,KJV,for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed,this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief,1,2CO.12
5506,2CO,13,KJV,this is the third time i am coming to you,and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body,1,2CO.13
5507,2CO,13,KJV,in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established,i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to youward is not weak but is mighty in you,0,2CO.13
5508,2CO,13,KJV,i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to youward is not weak but is mighty in you,for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god,0,2CO.13
5509,2CO,13,KJV,for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god,for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you,0,2CO.13
5510,2CO,13,KJV,for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you,fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known,1,2CO.13
5511,2CO,13,KJV,examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves,but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose,1,2CO.13
5512,2CO,13,KJV,know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates,therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth,1,2CO.13
5513,2CO,13,KJV,but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates,and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ,1,2CO.13
5514,2CO,13,KJV,now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates,for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth,0,2CO.13
5515,2CO,13,KJV,for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth,and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings,1,2CO.13
5516,2CO,13,KJV,for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection,and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless,1,2CO.13
5517,2CO,13,KJV,therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction,be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you,0,2CO.13
5518,2CO,13,KJV,be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you,greet one another with an holy kiss,0,2CO.13
5519,2CO,13,KJV,greet one another with an holy kiss,the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all,0,2CO.13
5520,2CO,13,KJV,the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all,and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved,1,2CO.13
5521,2CO,13,KJV,the second epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi a city of macedonia by titus and lucas,think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil,1,2CO.13
5522,GAL,1,KJV,paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father to whom be glory for ever and ever,he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day,1,GAL.1
5523,GAL,1,KJV,i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ,but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed,0,GAL.1
5524,GAL,1,KJV,but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed,as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed,0,GAL.1
5525,GAL,1,KJV,as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed,nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing,1,GAL.1
5526,GAL,1,KJV,for do i now persuade men or god,or do i seek to please men,0,GAL.1
5527,GAL,1,KJV,or do i seek to please men,for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ,0,GAL.1
5528,GAL,1,KJV,for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ,but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man,0,GAL.1
5529,GAL,1,KJV,but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man,for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ,0,GAL.1
5530,GAL,1,KJV,for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ,for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers,0,GAL.1
5531,GAL,1,KJV,for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers,but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus,0,GAL.1
5532,GAL,1,KJV,but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus,then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days,0,GAL.1
5533,GAL,1,KJV,then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days,behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have,1,GAL.1
5534,GAL,1,KJV,but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lords brother,let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying,1,GAL.1
5535,GAL,1,KJV,now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not,afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed,0,GAL.1
5536,GAL,1,KJV,afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed,and they glorified god in me,0,GAL.1
5537,GAL,1,KJV,and they glorified god in me,and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect,1,GAL.1
5538,GAL,2,KJV,then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also,now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him,1,GAL.2
5539,GAL,2,KJV,and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain,but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you,0,GAL.2
5540,GAL,2,KJV,but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you,but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision,0,GAL.2
5541,GAL,2,KJV,but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision,he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love,1,GAL.2
5542,GAL,2,KJV,only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do,and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals,1,GAL.2
5543,GAL,2,KJV,but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed,all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world,1,GAL.2
5544,GAL,2,KJV,for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision,and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation,0,GAL.2
5545,GAL,2,KJV,and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation,but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews,0,GAL.2
5546,GAL,2,KJV,but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews,but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast ,1,GAL.2
5547,GAL,2,KJV,we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified,and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far,1,GAL.2
5548,GAL,2,KJV,but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin,i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly,1,GAL.2
5549,GAL,2,KJV,for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor,for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god,0,GAL.2
5550,GAL,2,KJV,for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god,and the people asked him saying what shall we do then,1,GAL.2
5551,GAL,2,KJV,i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me,i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain,0,GAL.2
5552,GAL,2,KJV,i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain,o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you,0,GAL.2
5553,GAL,3,KJV,o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you,he said he is a prophet,1,GAL.3
5554,GAL,3,KJV,this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith,let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge,1,GAL.3
5555,GAL,3,KJV,having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh,have ye suffered so many things in vain,0,GAL.3
5556,GAL,3,KJV,have ye suffered so many things in vain,if it be yet in vain,0,GAL.3
5557,GAL,3,KJV,if it be yet in vain,so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets,1,GAL.3
5558,GAL,3,KJV,he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith,and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone,1,GAL.3
5559,GAL,3,KJV,even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness,know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham,0,GAL.3
5560,GAL,3,KJV,know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham,therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened,1,GAL.3
5561,GAL,3,KJV,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed,so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham,0,GAL.3
5562,GAL,3,KJV,so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham,now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another,1,GAL.3
5563,GAL,3,KJV,for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them,every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head,1,GAL.3
5564,GAL,3,KJV,but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith,and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child ,1,GAL.3
5565,GAL,3,KJV,and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them,now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter,1,GAL.3
5566,GAL,3,KJV,christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith,how much more things that pertain to this life,1,GAL.3
5567,GAL,3,KJV,brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a mans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto,for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me,1,GAL.3
5568,GAL,3,KJV,now to abraham and his seed were the promises made,and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul,1,GAL.3
5569,GAL,3,KJV,he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ,and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven,1,GAL.3
5570,GAL,3,KJV,and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect,for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise,0,GAL.3
5571,GAL,3,KJV,for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise,it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator,0,GAL.3
5572,GAL,3,KJV,it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator,know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god,1,GAL.3
5573,GAL,3,KJV,now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one,is the law then against the promises of god,0,GAL.3
5574,GAL,3,KJV,is the law then against the promises of god,god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law,0,GAL.3
5575,GAL,3,KJV,god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law,but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe,0,GAL.3
5576,GAL,3,KJV,but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe,but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed,0,GAL.3
5577,GAL,3,KJV,but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed,but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask,1,GAL.3
5578,GAL,3,KJV,wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith,and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven,1,GAL.3
5579,GAL,3,KJV,but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster,and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you,1,GAL.3
5580,GAL,3,KJV,for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus,for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ,0,GAL.3
5581,GAL,3,KJV,for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ,and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again,1,GAL.3
5582,GAL,3,KJV,there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus,and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise,0,GAL.3
5583,GAL,3,KJV,and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise,now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father,0,GAL.3
5584,GAL,4,KJV,now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father,even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons,0,GAL.4
5585,GAL,4,KJV,even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons,this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them,1,GAL.4
5586,GAL,4,KJV,and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father,wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ,0,GAL.4
5587,GAL,4,KJV,wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ,howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods,0,GAL.4
5588,GAL,4,KJV,howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods,and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him,1,GAL.4
5589,GAL,4,KJV,but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage,then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed,1,GAL.4
5590,GAL,4,KJV,ye observe days and months and times and years,i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain,0,GAL.4
5591,GAL,4,KJV,i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain,go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come,1,GAL.4
5592,GAL,4,KJV,brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all,and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate,1,GAL.4
5593,GAL,4,KJV,ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first,the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance,1,GAL.4
5594,GAL,4,KJV,and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus,where is then the blessedness ye spake of,0,GAL.4
5595,GAL,4,KJV,where is then the blessedness ye spake of,and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years,1,GAL.4
5596,GAL,4,KJV,for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me,am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth,0,GAL.4
5597,GAL,4,KJV,am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth,for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet,1,GAL.4
5598,GAL,4,KJV,they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them,but it is good to be zealously affected always in good thing and not only when i am present with you,0,GAL.4
5599,GAL,4,KJV,but it is good to be zealously affected always in good thing and not only when i am present with you,my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you,0,GAL.4
5600,GAL,4,KJV,my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you,but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god,1,GAL.4
5601,GAL,4,KJV,tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law,for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman,0,GAL.4
5602,GAL,4,KJV,for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman,but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise,0,GAL.4
5603,GAL,4,KJV,but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise,for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always,1,GAL.4
5604,GAL,4,KJV,which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar,for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,1,GAL.4
5605,GAL,4,KJV,for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children,then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls,1,GAL.4
5606,GAL,4,KJV,but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all,yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants,1,GAL.4
5607,GAL,4,KJV,for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband,now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise,0,GAL.4
5608,GAL,4,KJV,now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise,but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now,0,GAL.4
5609,GAL,4,KJV,but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now,know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ,1,GAL.4
5610,GAL,4,KJV,cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman,so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free,0,GAL.4
5611,GAL,4,KJV,so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free,for some are already turned aside after satan,1,GAL.4
5612,GAL,5,KJV,stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him,1,GAL.5
5613,GAL,5,KJV,behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing,for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law,0,GAL.5
5614,GAL,5,KJV,for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law,and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb,1,GAL.5
5615,GAL,5,KJV,christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace,and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god,1,GAL.5
5616,GAL,5,KJV,for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith,for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love,0,GAL.5
5617,GAL,5,KJV,for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love,nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband,1,GAL.5
5618,GAL,5,KJV,ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth,and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them,1,GAL.5
5619,GAL,5,KJV,this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you,a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,0,GAL.5
5620,GAL,5,KJV,a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven,1,GAL.5
5621,GAL,5,KJV,i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be,and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants,1,GAL.5
5622,GAL,5,KJV,and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution,others said that it is elias,1,GAL.5
5623,GAL,5,KJV,then is the offence of the cross ceased,the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole,1,GAL.5
5624,GAL,5,KJV,i would they were even cut off which trouble you,jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up,1,GAL.5
5625,GAL,5,KJV,for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another,for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all,1,GAL.5
5626,GAL,5,KJV,for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him,1,GAL.5
5627,GAL,5,KJV,but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another,this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh,0,GAL.5
5628,GAL,5,KJV,this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh,for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,0,GAL.5
5629,GAL,5,KJV,for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain,1,GAL.5
5630,GAL,5,KJV,but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law,now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god,0,GAL.5
5631,GAL,5,KJV,now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god,now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work,1,GAL.5
5632,GAL,5,KJV,but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law,and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts,0,GAL.5
5633,GAL,5,KJV,and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts,if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit,0,GAL.5
5634,GAL,5,KJV,if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit,and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man,1,GAL.5
5635,GAL,5,KJV,let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another,brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted,0,GAL.5
5636,GAL,6,KJV,brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted,bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ,0,GAL.6
5637,GAL,6,KJV,bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ,he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them,1,GAL.6
5638,GAL,6,KJV,for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself,for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperate holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers,1,GAL.6
5639,GAL,6,KJV,but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another,now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god ,1,GAL.6
5640,GAL,6,KJV,for every man shall bear his own burden,is not he that sitteth at meat,1,GAL.6
5641,GAL,6,KJV,let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things,shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus,1,GAL.6
5642,GAL,6,KJV,be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap,behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out,1,GAL.6
5643,GAL,6,KJV,for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting,but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee,1,GAL.6
5644,GAL,6,KJV,and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not,as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith,0,GAL.6
5645,GAL,6,KJV,as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith,ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand,0,GAL.6
5646,GAL,6,KJV,ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand,as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ,0,GAL.6
5647,GAL,6,KJV,as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ,for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh,0,GAL.6
5648,GAL,6,KJV,for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh,but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world,0,GAL.6
5649,GAL,6,KJV,but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world,and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come,1,GAL.6
5650,GAL,6,KJV,for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature,the brethren which are with me greet you,1,GAL.6
5651,GAL,6,KJV,and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god,from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus,0,GAL.6
5652,GAL,6,KJV,from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus,and what communion hath light with darkness,1,GAL.6
5653,GAL,6,KJV,brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit,unto the galatians written from rome,0,GAL.6
5654,GAL,6,KJV,unto the galatians written from rome,for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods,1,GAL.6
5655,EPH,1,KJV,paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ,and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled,1,EPH.1
5656,EPH,1,KJV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved,they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou,1,EPH.1
5657,EPH,1,KJV,in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ,in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory,0,EPH.1
5658,EPH,1,KJV,in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory,and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb,1,EPH.1
5659,EPH,1,KJV,wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all,and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others,0,EPH.1
5668,EPH,3,KJV,for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power,and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men,1,EPH.3
5669,EPH,3,KJV,unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him,if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise,1,EPH.3
5670,EPH,3,KJV,wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory,for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god,0,EPH.3
5671,EPH,3,KJV,for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god,and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant,1,EPH.3
5672,EPH,3,KJV,now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end,i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,0,EPH.3
5687,EPH,5,KJV,be ye therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour,and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him,1,EPH.5
5688,EPH,5,KJV,but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks,for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god,0,EPH.5
5689,EPH,5,KJV,for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god,let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience,0,EPH.5
5690,EPH,5,KJV,let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience,be not ye therefore partakers with them,0,EPH.5
5691,EPH,5,KJV,be not ye therefore partakers with them,written from rome to the colossians by tychicus and onesimus,1,EPH.5
5692,EPH,5,KJV,for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord,and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them ,0,EPH.5
5693,EPH,5,KJV,and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them ,and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified,1,EPH.5
5694,EPH,5,KJV,for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret,but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man,1,EPH.5
5695,EPH,5,KJV,but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light,wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light,0,EPH.5
5696,EPH,5,KJV,wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light,it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body,1,EPH.5
5697,EPH,5,KJV,see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil,and with what body do they come,1,EPH.5
5698,EPH,5,KJV,wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is ,and this did she many days,1,EPH.5
5699,EPH,5,KJV,and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god,and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand,1,EPH.5
5700,EPH,5,KJV,wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord,then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power,1,EPH.5
5701,EPH,5,KJV,for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body,therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing,0,EPH.5
5702,EPH,5,KJV,therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing,thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury,1,EPH.5
5703,EPH,5,KJV,husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish,so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies,0,EPH.5
5704,EPH,5,KJV,so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies,and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer,1,EPH.5
5705,EPH,5,KJV,he that loveth his wife loveth himself,for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones,0,EPH.5
5706,EPH,5,KJV,for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones,for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh,0,EPH.5
5707,EPH,5,KJV,for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh,i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me,1,EPH.5
5708,EPH,5,KJV,this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church,nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband,0,EPH.5
5709,EPH,5,KJV,nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right,0,EPH.5
5710,EPH,6,KJV,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right,and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne,1,EPH.6
5711,EPH,6,KJV,honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth,and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord,0,EPH.6
5712,EPH,6,KJV,and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord,for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god,1,EPH.6
5713,EPH,6,KJV,servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free,beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy,1,EPH.6
5714,EPH,6,KJV,and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him,finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might,0,EPH.6

5716,EPH,6,KJV,put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ,0,EPH.6
5717,EPH,6,KJV,for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ,wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand,0,EPH.6

5858,1TH,2,KJV,for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which trieth our hearts,for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh,1,1TH.2
5859,1TH,2,KJV,for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness god is witness nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ,and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created,1,1TH.2

5872,1TH,3,KJV,for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in vain,but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord,0,1TH.3
5873,1TH,3,KJV,but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord,and the woman was made whole from that hour,1,1TH.3

5885,1TH,4,KJV,for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him,but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void,1,1TH.4
5886,1TH,4,KJV,for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep,and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden,1,1TH.4

5895,1TH,5,KJV,for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night,he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge,1,1TH.5
5896,1TH,5,KJV,but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation,for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him,0,1TH.5
5897,1TH,5,KJV,for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him,wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do,0,1TH.5

5920,2TH,2,KJV,and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved,now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god,1,2TH.2
5921,2TH,2,KJV,and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness,but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ,0,2TH.2

5930,2TH,3,KJV,for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you neither did we eat any mans bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us,and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him,1,2TH.3
5931,2TH,3,KJV,for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat,and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him,1,2TH.3
5932,2TH,3,KJV,for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies,now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread,0,2TH.3
5933,2TH,3,KJV,now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread,but ye brethren be not weary in well doing,0,2TH.3

5935,2TH,3,KJV,and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed,yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother,0,2TH.3

5938,2TH,3,KJV,the lord be with you all,and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls,1,2TH.3
5939,2TH,3,KJV,the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write,and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist,1,2TH.3

5979,1TI,4,KJV,for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe,but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you,1,1TI.4

5987,1TI,5,KJV,but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before god,now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day,0,1TI.5

6152,HEB,3,KJV,wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house,is it so that there is not a wise man among you,1,HEB.3
6153,HEB,3,KJV,for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house,for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god,0,HEB.3
6154,HEB,3,KJV,for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god,and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end,0,HEB.3
6155,HEB,3,KJV,and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end,we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves,1,HEB.3
6156,HEB,3,KJV,wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years,the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,1,HEB.3
6157,HEB,3,KJV,wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways,so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god,0,HEB.3
6158,HEB,3,KJV,so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god,ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye,1,HEB.3
6159,HEB,3,KJV,but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation,0,HEB.3
6160,HEB,3,KJV,for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation,for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses,0,HEB.3

6164,HEB,3,KJV,and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not,so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief,0,HEB.3
6165,HEB,3,KJV,so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief,for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god,1,HEB.3
6166,HEB,4,KJV,let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it,for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it ,0,HEB.4
6167,HEB,4,KJV,for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it ,for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world,0,HEB.4
6168,HEB,4,KJV,for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world,for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works,0,HEB.4
6169,HEB,4,KJV,for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works,and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest,0,HEB.4
6170,HEB,4,KJV,and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest,and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me,1,HEB.4
6171,HEB,4,KJV,seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace,1,HEB.4
6172,HEB,4,KJV,for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day,there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god,0,HEB.4
6173,HEB,4,KJV,there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god,for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his,0,HEB.4
6174,HEB,4,KJV,for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his,jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me,1,HEB.4
6175,HEB,4,KJV,let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief,for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,0,HEB.4
6176,HEB,4,KJV,for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,0,HEB.4
6177,HEB,4,KJV,neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,they say unto him we also go with thee,1,HEB.4
6178,HEB,4,KJV,seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession,for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin,0,HEB.4
6179,HEB,4,KJV,for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin,but he held his peace and answered nothing,1,HEB.4
6180,HEB,4,KJV,let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need,but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man,1,HEB.4
6181,HEB,5,KJV,for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity,and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins,0,HEB.5
6182,HEB,5,KJV,and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins,jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me,1,HEB.5
6183,HEB,5,KJV,and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron,while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live,1,HEB.5
6184,HEB,5,KJV,so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee,as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec,0,HEB.5
6185,HEB,5,KJV,as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec,but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say,1,HEB.5
6186,HEB,5,KJV,who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec,of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing,0,HEB.5
6187,HEB,5,KJV,of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing,for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat,0,HEB.5
6188,HEB,5,KJV,for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat,and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them,1,HEB.5
6189,HEB,5,KJV,for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe,and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode,1,HEB.5
6190,HEB,5,KJV,but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil,therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment,0,HEB.5
6191,HEB,6,KJV,therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment,neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house,1,HEB.6
6192,HEB,6,KJV,and this will we do if god permit,behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds,1,HEB.6
6193,HEB,6,KJV,for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame,now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done unto thee,1,HEB.6
6194,HEB,6,KJV,for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned,but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak,0,HEB.6
6195,HEB,6,KJV,but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak,beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches,1,HEB.6
6196,HEB,6,KJV,for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister,pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him,1,HEB.6
6197,HEB,6,KJV,and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises,and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee,1,HEB.6
6198,HEB,6,KJV,for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee,and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town,1,HEB.6
6199,HEB,6,KJV,and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise,for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife,0,HEB.6
6200,HEB,6,KJV,for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife,woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep,1,HEB.6
6201,HEB,6,KJV,wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec,for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually,0,HEB.6
6202,HEB,7,KJV,for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually,now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils,0,HEB.7
6203,HEB,7,KJV,now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils,and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises,0,HEB.7
6204,HEB,7,KJV,and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises,they answered and said he is guilty of death,1,HEB.7
6205,HEB,7,KJV,and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better,and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth,0,HEB.7
6206,HEB,7,KJV,and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth,wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator,1,HEB.7
6207,HEB,7,KJV,and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham,for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints,1,HEB.7
6208,HEB,7,KJV,for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him,for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears,1,HEB.7
6209,HEB,7,KJV,if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron,for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law,0,HEB.7
6210,HEB,7,KJV,for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law,and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass,1,HEB.7
6211,HEB,7,KJV,for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar,for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood,0,HEB.7
6212,HEB,7,KJV,for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood,and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing,1,HEB.7
6213,HEB,7,KJV,and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life,for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec,0,HEB.7
6214,HEB,7,KJV,for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec,for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ,1,HEB.7
6215,HEB,7,KJV,for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof,but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons,1,HEB.7
6216,HEB,7,KJV,for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god,and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting,1,HEB.7
6217,HEB,7,KJV,and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament,a man clothed in soft raiment,1,HEB.7
6218,HEB,7,KJV,and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood,wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them,0,HEB.7
6219,HEB,7,KJV,wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them,for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself,0,HEB.7
6220,HEB,7,KJV,for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself,but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended,1,HEB.7
6221,HEB,7,KJV,for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore,now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man,0,HEB.7
6222,HEB,8,KJV,now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man,for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer,0,HEB.8
6223,HEB,8,KJV,for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer,and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared,1,HEB.8
6224,HEB,8,KJV,for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount,but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises,0,HEB.8
6225,HEB,8,KJV,but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises,for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second,0,HEB.8
6226,HEB,8,KJV,for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second,for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord,0,HEB.8
6227,HEB,8,KJV,for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord,i go to prepare a place for you,1,HEB.8
6228,HEB,8,KJV,for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest,for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself,1,HEB.8
6229,HEB,8,KJV,for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more,in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old,0,HEB.8
6230,HEB,8,KJV,in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old,but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation,1,HEB.8
6231,HEB,8,KJV,now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away,and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath,1,HEB.8
6232,HEB,9,KJV,then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary,for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it ,1,HEB.9
6233,HEB,9,KJV,for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary,also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god,1,HEB.9
6234,HEB,9,KJV,and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aarons rod that budded and the tables of the covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly,now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god ,0,HEB.9
6235,HEB,9,KJV,now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god ,but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation,0,HEB.9
6236,HEB,9,KJV,but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation,but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us ,0,HEB.9
6237,HEB,9,KJV,but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us ,for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god,0,HEB.9
6238,HEB,9,KJV,for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god,and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance,0,HEB.9
6239,HEB,9,KJV,and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance,for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator,0,HEB.9
6240,HEB,9,KJV,for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator,for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth,0,HEB.9
6241,HEB,9,KJV,for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth,whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood,0,HEB.9
6242,HEB,9,KJV,whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood,for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you,0,HEB.9
6243,HEB,9,KJV,for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you,and the next day we touched at sidon,1,HEB.9
6244,HEB,9,KJV,moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry,do we begin again to commend ourselves,1,HEB.9
6245,HEB,9,KJV,and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission,but ye have made it a den of thieves,1,HEB.9
6246,HEB,9,KJV,it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these,for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself,0,HEB.9
6247,HEB,9,KJV,for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself,ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted,1,HEB.9
6248,HEB,9,KJV,and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation,for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit,1,HEB.9
6249,HEB,10,KJV,for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect,for then would they not have ceased to be offered,0,HEB.10
6250,HEB,10,KJV,for then would they not have ceased to be offered,and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean,1,HEB.10
6251,HEB,10,KJV,because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins,this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes,1,HEB.10
6252,HEB,10,KJV,but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year,but what went ye out for to see,1,HEB.10
6253,HEB,10,KJV,for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins,wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure,0,HEB.10
6254,HEB,10,KJV,wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure,then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god,0,HEB.10
6255,HEB,10,KJV,then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god,thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself,1,HEB.10
6256,HEB,10,KJV,above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo i come to do thy will o god,or why talkest thou with her,1,HEB.10
6257,HEB,10,KJV,he taketh away the first that he may establish the second,by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all ,0,HEB.10
6258,HEB,10,KJV,by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all ,but he held his peace and answered nothing,1,HEB.10
6259,HEB,10,KJV,and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool,for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,0,HEB.10
6260,HEB,10,KJV,for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates,1,HEB.10
6261,HEB,10,KJV,whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more,and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified,1,HEB.10
6262,HEB,10,KJV,now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin,having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water,0,HEB.10
6263,HEB,10,KJV,having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water,and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries,1,HEB.10
6264,HEB,10,KJV,let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching,for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries,0,HEB.10
6265,HEB,10,KJV,for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries,he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace,0,HEB.10
6266,HEB,10,KJV,he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace,for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord,0,HEB.10
6267,HEB,10,KJV,for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord,and again the lord shall judge his people,0,HEB.10
6268,HEB,10,KJV,and again the lord shall judge his people,and jesus saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise,1,HEB.10
6269,HEB,10,KJV,it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god,for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,1,HEB.10
6270,HEB,10,KJV,but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used,for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance,0,HEB.10
6271,HEB,10,KJV,for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance,and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live,1,HEB.10
6272,HEB,10,KJV,cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward,he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward,1,HEB.10
6273,HEB,10,KJV,for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise,for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry,0,HEB.10
6274,HEB,10,KJV,for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry,now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him,0,HEB.10
6275,HEB,10,KJV,now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him,but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,0,HEB.10
6276,HEB,10,KJV,but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen,0,HEB.10
6277,HEB,11,KJV,now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen,let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god,1,HEB.11
6278,HEB,11,KJV,for by it the elders obtained a good report,and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass,1,HEB.11
6279,HEB,11,KJV,through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear,by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh,0,HEB.11
6280,HEB,11,KJV,by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh,but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,1,HEB.11
6281,HEB,11,KJV,by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god,then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness,1,HEB.11
6282,HEB,11,KJV,but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him,but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom,1,HEB.11
6283,HEB,11,KJV,by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith,but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonour,1,HEB.11
6284,HEB,11,KJV,by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went,but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews,1,HEB.11
6285,HEB,11,KJV,by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god,through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised,0,HEB.11
6286,HEB,11,KJV,through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised,therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable,0,HEB.11
6287,HEB,11,KJV,therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable,so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god,1,HEB.11
6288,HEB,11,KJV,these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth,and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased,1,HEB.11
6289,HEB,11,KJV,for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country,and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned,0,HEB.11
6290,HEB,11,KJV,and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned,while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light,1,HEB.11
6291,HEB,11,KJV,but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city,or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand,1,HEB.11
6292,HEB,11,KJV,by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure,and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught,1,HEB.11
6293,HEB,11,KJV,by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come,by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff,0,HEB.11
6294,HEB,11,KJV,by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff,beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth,1,HEB.11
6295,HEB,11,KJV,by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones,and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done,1,HEB.11
6296,HEB,11,KJV,by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment,i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me,1,HEB.11
6297,HEB,11,KJV,by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward,and another said is it i,1,HEB.11
6298,HEB,11,KJV,by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible,for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity,1,HEB.11
6299,HEB,11,KJV,through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them,the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not,1,HEB.11
6300,HEB,11,KJV,by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned,by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days,0,HEB.11
6301,HEB,11,KJV,by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days,by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace,0,HEB.11
6302,HEB,11,KJV,by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace,and what shall i more say,0,HEB.11
6303,HEB,11,KJV,and what shall i more say,for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens,0,HEB.11
6304,HEB,11,KJV,for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens,women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth,0,HEB.11
6305,HEB,11,KJV,women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth,and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea,1,HEB.11
6306,HEB,11,KJV,and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect,there was a man sent from god whose name was john,1,HEB.11
6307,HEB,12,KJV,wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god,for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds,0,HEB.12
6308,HEB,12,KJV,for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds,and they say unto her woman why weepest thou,1,HEB.12
6309,HEB,12,KJV,ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin,and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,0,HEB.12
6310,HEB,12,KJV,and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him,1,HEB.12
6311,HEB,12,KJV,if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not,there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty,1,HEB.12
6312,HEB,12,KJV,but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons,furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live,0,HEB.12
6313,HEB,12,KJV,furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live,for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god,1,HEB.12
6314,HEB,12,KJV,for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness,now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby,0,HEB.12
6315,HEB,12,KJV,now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby,jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied,1,HEB.12
6316,HEB,12,KJV,wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed,and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them,1,HEB.12
6317,HEB,12,KJV,follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright,for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him,1,HEB.12
6318,HEB,12,KJV,for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears,for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel,0,HEB.12
6319,HEB,12,KJV,for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel,and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom,1,HEB.12
6320,HEB,12,KJV,see that ye refuse not him that speaketh,for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven,0,HEB.12
6321,HEB,12,KJV,for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven,and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain,0,HEB.12
6322,HEB,12,KJV,and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain,wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire,0,HEB.12
6323,HEB,12,KJV,wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire,howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god,1,HEB.12
6348,JAS,1,KJV,james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting,my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience,0,JAS.1
6349,JAS,1,KJV,my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience,and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed,1,JAS.1
6350,JAS,1,KJV,but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing,if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him,0,JAS.1
6351,JAS,1,KJV,if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him,and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eloi eloi lama sabachthani,1,JAS.1
6352,JAS,1,KJV,but let him ask in faith nothing wavering,for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed,0,JAS.1
6353,JAS,1,KJV,for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed,but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men,1,JAS.1
6354,JAS,1,KJV,for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord,a double minded man is unstable in all his ways,0,JAS.1
6355,JAS,1,KJV,a double minded man is unstable in all his ways,and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews,1,JAS.1
6356,JAS,1,KJV,let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away,for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways,0,JAS.1

6358,JAS,1,KJV,blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him,in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far,1,JAS.1
6359,JAS,1,KJV,let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed,and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them,1,JAS.1

6480,1PE,2,KJV,but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god,for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed,0,1PE.2
6481,1PE,2,KJV,for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed,for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls,0,1PE.2
6482,1PE,2,KJV,for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls,then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart,1,1PE.2
6483,1PE,3,KJV,likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear,and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them,1,1PE.3
6484,1PE,3,KJV,whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price,and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack of nothing,1,1PE.3
6485,1PE,3,KJV,for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement,likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered,0,1PE.3
6486,1PE,3,KJV,likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered,finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing,0,1PE.3
6487,1PE,3,KJV,finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing,for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it,0,1PE.3
6488,1PE,3,KJV,for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it,for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil,0,1PE.3
6489,1PE,3,KJV,for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil,martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days,1,1PE.3
6490,1PE,3,KJV,and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good,the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him,1,1PE.3
6491,1PE,3,KJV,but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ,every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver,1,1PE.3

6494,1PE,3,KJV,the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him,but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought,1,1PE.3
6495,1PE,4,KJV,forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god,and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes,1,1PE.4
6496,1PE,4,KJV,for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead,for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit,0,1PE.4
6497,1PE,4,KJV,for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit,then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children,1,1PE.4

6499,1PE,4,KJV,and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins,use hospitality one to another without grudging,0,1PE.4
6500,1PE,4,KJV,use hospitality one to another without grudging,as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god,0,1PE.4

6502,1PE,4,KJV,if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever,then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1,1PE.4
6503,1PE,4,KJV,beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy,and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus,1,1PE.4
6504,1PE,4,KJV,if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified,but the very hairs of your head are all numbered,1,1PE.4
6505,1PE,4,KJV,but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters,and he answering said unto him thou sayest it ,1,1PE.4
6506,1PE,4,KJV,yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf,there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge,1,1PE.4
6507,1PE,4,KJV,for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god,and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear,0,1PE.4
6508,1PE,4,KJV,and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear,wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator,0,1PE.4
6509,1PE,4,KJV,wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator,the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind neither as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock,0,1PE.4

6511,1PE,5,KJV,and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away,likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder,0,1PE.5
6512,1PE,5,KJV,likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder,shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot,1,1PE.5
6513,1PE,5,KJV,yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble,and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly,1,1PE.5
6514,1PE,5,KJV,humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you,be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world,0,1PE.5
6515,1PE,5,KJV,be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world,and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation,1,1PE.5
6516,1PE,5,KJV,but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you ,and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods,1,1PE.5
6517,1PE,5,KJV,to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever,shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus,1,1PE.5
6518,1PE,5,KJV,by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand,and in the evening he cometh with the twelve,1,1PE.5
6519,1PE,5,KJV,the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son,greet ye one another with a kiss of charity,0,1PE.5
6520,1PE,5,KJV,greet ye one another with a kiss of charity,give us this day our daily bread,1,1PE.5
6521,1PE,5,KJV,peace be with you all that are in christ jesus,behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth,1,1PE.5
6522,2PE,1,KJV,simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust,for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me,1,2PE.1
6523,2PE,1,KJV,and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity,for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ,0,2PE.1
6524,2PE,1,KJV,for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ,but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins,0,2PE.1
6525,2PE,1,KJV,but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins,for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ not boasting of things without our measure that is of other mens labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our hand,1,2PE.1
6526,2PE,1,KJV,wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ,wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth,0,2PE.1
6527,2PE,1,KJV,wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth,yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me,0,2PE.1
6528,2PE,1,KJV,yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me,and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do,1,2PE.1
6529,2PE,1,KJV,moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance,for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty,0,2PE.1
6530,2PE,1,KJV,for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty,for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased,0,2PE.1
6531,2PE,1,KJV,for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased,and they answered john the baptist but some say elias and others one of the prophets,1,2PE.1
6532,2PE,1,KJV,and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount,we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation,0,2PE.1
6533,2PE,1,KJV,we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation,for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost,0,2PE.1
6534,2PE,1,KJV,for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost,but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction,0,2PE.1
6535,2PE,2,KJV,but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction,and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of,0,2PE.2
6536,2PE,2,KJV,and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of,and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not,0,2PE.2
6537,2PE,2,KJV,and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not,and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us,1,2PE.2
6538,2PE,2,KJV,for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government,and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates,1,2PE.2
6539,2PE,2,KJV,presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities,whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord,0,2PE.2
6540,2PE,2,KJV,whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord,and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him,1,2PE.2
6541,2PE,2,KJV,but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime,he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others,1,2PE.2
6542,2PE,2,KJV,spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet,these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever,0,2PE.2
6543,2PE,2,KJV,these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever,for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error,0,2PE.2
6544,2PE,2,KJV,for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error,while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage,0,2PE.2
6545,2PE,2,KJV,while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent,1,2PE.2
6546,2PE,2,KJV,for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning,for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them,0,2PE.2
6547,2PE,2,KJV,for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them,consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these,1,2PE.2
6548,2PE,2,KJV,but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire,and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever,1,2PE.2
6549,2PE,3,KJV,this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming,to morrow said he thou shalt hear him,1,2PE.3
6550,2PE,3,KJV,for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation,wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias,1,2PE.3
6551,2PE,3,KJV,for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men,but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day,0,2PE.3
6552,2PE,3,KJV,but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day,for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity,1,2PE.3
6553,2PE,3,KJV,the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance,they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept,1,2PE.3
6554,2PE,3,KJV,but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up,for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done,1,2PE.3
6555,2PE,3,KJV,seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat,and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly,1,2PE.3
6556,2PE,3,KJV,nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone and sent timotheus our brother and minister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto,1,2PE.3
6557,2PE,3,KJV,wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless,and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction,0,2PE.3
6558,2PE,3,KJV,and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction,ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness,0,2PE.3
6559,2PE,3,KJV,ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness,but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ,1,2PE.3
6560,2PE,3,KJV,but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ,to him be glory both now and for ever,0,2PE.3
6561,2PE,3,KJV,to him be glory both now and for ever,now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine,1,2PE.3
6569,1JN,2,KJV,my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not,and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god,1,1JN.2
6570,1JN,2,KJV,and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world,and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments,0,1JN.2
6571,1JN,2,KJV,and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments,now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour,1,1JN.2

6633,1JN,4,KJV,beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world,and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea,1,1JN.4
6634,1JN,4,KJV,hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world,and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord that thou fulfil it,1,1JN.4

6655,1JN,4,KJV,if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen,and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also,0,1JN.4
6656,1JN,4,KJV,and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also,behold we count them happy which endure,1,1JN.4
6657,1JN,5,KJV,whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him,and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter ,1,1JN.5
6658,1JN,5,KJV,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments,for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous,0,1JN.5

6661,1JN,5,KJV,who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god,and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints,1,1JN.5
6662,1JN,5,KJV,this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood,then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls,1,1JN.5
6663,1JN,5,KJV,and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth,and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples,1,1JN.5
6664,1JN,5,KJV,for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one,and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one,0,1JN.5
6665,1JN,5,KJV,and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one,and if they were all one member where were the body,1,1JN.5
6666,1JN,5,KJV,if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son,then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar,1,1JN.5
6667,1JN,5,KJV,he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son,let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience,1,1JN.5

6671,1JN,5,KJV,and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him,but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils,1,1JN.5
6672,1JN,5,KJV,if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death,there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it,0,1JN.5
