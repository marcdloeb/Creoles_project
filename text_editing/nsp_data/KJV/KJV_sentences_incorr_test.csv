137,MAT,7,KJV,judge not that ye be not judged,and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs,1,MAT.7
138,MAT,7,KJV,for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again,then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid,1,MAT.7
139,MAT,7,KJV,and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye,and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein,1,MAT.7
140,MAT,7,KJV,or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye,and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also,1,MAT.7
141,MAT,7,KJV,thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it,1,MAT.7
142,MAT,7,KJV,give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you,and when he thought thereon he wept,1,MAT.7
143,MAT,7,KJV,ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened,and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him but their laying await was known of saul,1,MAT.7
144,MAT,7,KJV,or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone,they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee,1,MAT.7
145,MAT,7,KJV,or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent,thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet,1,MAT.7
146,MAT,7,KJV,if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him,the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment,1,MAT.7
147,MAT,7,KJV,therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets,therefore shall they be your judges,1,MAT.7
148,MAT,7,KJV,enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it,in your patience possess ye your souls,1,MAT.7
149,MAT,7,KJV,beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves,and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was,1,MAT.7
150,MAT,7,KJV,ye shall know them by their fruits,and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days,1,MAT.7
151,MAT,7,KJV,do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles,let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross,1,MAT.7
152,MAT,7,KJV,even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit,let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching,1,MAT.7
153,MAT,7,KJV,a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live,1,MAT.7
154,MAT,7,KJV,every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,and the morrow after they entered into caesarea,1,MAT.7
155,MAT,7,KJV,wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them,every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body,1,MAT.7
156,MAT,7,KJV,not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven,i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost,1,MAT.7
157,MAT,7,KJV,many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name,they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples,1,MAT.7
158,MAT,7,KJV,and in thy name have cast out devils,and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you,1,MAT.7
159,MAT,7,KJV,and in thy name done many wonderful works,and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it,1,MAT.7
160,MAT,7,KJV,and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity,he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not,1,MAT.7
161,MAT,7,KJV,therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock,and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved,1,MAT.7
162,MAT,7,KJV,and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it,and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace,1,MAT.7
163,MAT,7,KJV,and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes,of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow,1,MAT.7
356,MAT,13,KJV,the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side,but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me,1,MAT.13
357,MAT,13,KJV,and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore,and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ,1,MAT.13
358,MAT,13,KJV,and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away,wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands,1,MAT.13
359,MAT,13,KJV,and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold,and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it,1,MAT.13
360,MAT,13,KJV,who hath ears to hear let him hear,grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity,1,MAT.13
361,MAT,13,KJV,and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables,and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger,1,MAT.13
362,MAT,13,KJV,he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given,for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified,1,MAT.13
363,MAT,13,KJV,for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath,and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band,1,MAT.13
364,MAT,13,KJV,therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand,and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha,1,MAT.13
365,MAT,13,KJV,and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them,and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things,1,MAT.13
366,MAT,13,KJV,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear,the second epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi a city of macedonia by titus and lucas,1,MAT.13
367,MAT,13,KJV,for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the sower,and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him,1,MAT.13
368,MAT,13,KJV,when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart,so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus,1,MAT.13
369,MAT,13,KJV,this is he which received seed by the way side,pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him,1,MAT.13
370,MAT,13,KJV,but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended,so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee,1,MAT.13
371,MAT,13,KJV,he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful,for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity,1,MAT.13
372,MAT,13,KJV,but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty,and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able,1,MAT.13
373,MAT,13,KJV,another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way,let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready,1,MAT.13
374,MAT,13,KJV,but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also,or else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man,1,MAT.13
375,MAT,13,KJV,so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field,and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you,1,MAT.13
376,MAT,13,KJV,from whence then hath it tares,as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love,1,MAT.13
377,MAT,13,KJV,he said unto them an enemy hath done this,when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him,1,MAT.13
378,MAT,13,KJV,the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up,for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries,1,MAT.13
379,MAT,13,KJV,but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them,and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus,1,MAT.13
380,MAT,13,KJV,let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn,then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him,1,MAT.13
381,MAT,13,KJV,another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof,and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again,1,MAT.13
382,MAT,13,KJV,another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened,and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death,1,MAT.13
383,MAT,13,KJV,all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world,and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares,1,MAT.13
384,MAT,13,KJV,then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field,therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days,1,MAT.13
385,MAT,13,KJV,he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels,and i john saw these things and heard them ,1,MAT.13
386,MAT,13,KJV,as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world,because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub,1,MAT.13
387,MAT,13,KJV,the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth,then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly,1,MAT.13
388,MAT,13,KJV,then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father,therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin,1,MAT.13
389,MAT,13,KJV,who hath ears to hear let him hear,but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in,1,MAT.13
390,MAT,13,KJV,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field,and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth,1,MAT.13
391,MAT,13,KJV,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it,and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet,1,MAT.13
392,MAT,13,KJV,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away,and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts,1,MAT.13
393,MAT,13,KJV,so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth ,and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting,1,MAT.13
394,MAT,13,KJV,jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things,for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ,1,MAT.13
395,MAT,13,KJV,they say unto him yea lord,for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation,1,MAT.13
396,MAT,13,KJV,then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old,how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed,1,MAT.13
397,MAT,13,KJV,and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence,give us day by day our daily bread,1,MAT.13
398,MAT,13,KJV,and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works,and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace,1,MAT.13
399,MAT,13,KJV,is not this the carpenters son,love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law,1,MAT.13
400,MAT,13,KJV,is not his mother called mary,verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,1,MAT.13
401,MAT,13,KJV,and his brethren james and joses and simon and judas,therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,1,MAT.13
402,MAT,13,KJV,and his sisters are they not all with us,for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ,1,MAT.13
403,MAT,13,KJV,whence then hath this man all these things,and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner,1,MAT.13
404,MAT,13,KJV,and they were offended in him,because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be,1,MAT.13
405,MAT,13,KJV,but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house,and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man,1,MAT.13
406,MAT,13,KJV,and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief,of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath,1,MAT.13
540,MAT,18,KJV,at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes,1,MAT.18
541,MAT,18,KJV,and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven,for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest,1,MAT.18
542,MAT,18,KJV,whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven,moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified,1,MAT.18
543,MAT,18,KJV,and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me,greet amplias my beloved in the lord,1,MAT.18
544,MAT,18,KJV,but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea,written from rome to philemon by onesimus a servant,1,MAT.18
545,MAT,18,KJV,woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire,now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work,1,MAT.18
546,MAT,18,KJV,and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire,alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord reward him according to his works of whom be thou ware also for he hath greatly withstood our words,1,MAT.18
547,MAT,18,KJV,take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven,then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and the jews about purifying,1,MAT.18
548,MAT,18,KJV,for the son of man is come to save that which was lost,thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done,1,MAT.18
549,MAT,18,KJV,if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray,and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god,1,MAT.18
550,MAT,18,KJV,and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray,and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out,1,MAT.18
551,MAT,18,KJV,even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish,and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever,1,MAT.18
552,MAT,18,KJV,moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother,and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live,1,MAT.18
553,MAT,18,KJV,but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established,for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually,1,MAT.18
554,MAT,18,KJV,and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican,now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing,1,MAT.18
555,MAT,18,KJV,verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched,1,MAT.18
556,MAT,18,KJV,again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven,and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god,1,MAT.18
557,MAT,18,KJV,for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them,this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish,1,MAT.18
558,MAT,18,KJV,then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him,and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread,1,MAT.18
559,MAT,18,KJV,jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven,for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted,1,MAT.18
560,MAT,18,KJV,therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants,but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first,1,MAT.18
561,MAT,18,KJV,and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents,but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat,1,MAT.18
562,MAT,18,KJV,but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made,after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself ,1,MAT.18
563,MAT,18,KJV,the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all,for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence,1,MAT.18
564,MAT,18,KJV,then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt,if thou do these things shew thyself to the world,1,MAT.18
565,MAT,18,KJV,but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest,and this did she many days,1,MAT.18
566,MAT,18,KJV,and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all,and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me,1,MAT.18
567,MAT,18,KJV,and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt,but if any man love god the same is known of him,1,MAT.18
568,MAT,18,KJV,so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done,simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou,1,MAT.18
569,MAT,18,KJV,then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee,who is able to make war with him,1,MAT.18
570,MAT,18,KJV,and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him,and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence,1,MAT.18
571,MAT,18,KJV,so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses,shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace,1,MAT.18
1084,MRK,4,KJV,and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land,and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets,1,MRK.4
1085,MRK,4,KJV,and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine hearken behold there went out a sower to sow and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up,now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ,1,MRK.4
1086,MRK,4,KJV,and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away,and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest,1,MRK.4
1087,MRK,4,KJV,and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit,and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me,1,MRK.4
1088,MRK,4,KJV,and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred,then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we,1,MRK.4
1089,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear,moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans house and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved,1,MRK.4
1090,MRK,4,KJV,and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable,do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia,1,MRK.4
1091,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them,then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law,1,MRK.4
1092,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them know ye not this parable,and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission,1,MRK.4
1093,MRK,4,KJV,and how then will ye know all parables,have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas,1,MRK.4
1094,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts,when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel,1,MRK.4
1095,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended,brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus,1,MRK.4
1096,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful,he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love,1,MRK.4
1097,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred,but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil,1,MRK.4
1098,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed,and he sent and beheaded john in the prison,1,MRK.4
1099,MRK,4,KJV,and not to be set on a candlestick,and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs,1,MRK.4
1100,MRK,4,KJV,for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad,he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him,1,MRK.4
1101,MRK,4,KJV,if any man have ears to hear let him hear,and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched,1,MRK.4
1102,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be given,and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners,1,MRK.4
1103,MRK,4,KJV,for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath,wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men ,1,MRK.4
1104,MRK,4,KJV,and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how,is not his mother called mary,1,MRK.4
1105,MRK,4,KJV,for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear,jesus went unto the mount of olives,1,MRK.4
1106,MRK,4,KJV,but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come,and he wrote a letter after this manner claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting,1,MRK.4
1107,MRK,4,KJV,and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god,and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain,1,MRK.4
1108,MRK,4,KJV,or with what comparison shall we compare it,and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can satan cast out satan,1,MRK.4
1109,MRK,4,KJV,it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it,and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound,1,MRK.4
1110,MRK,4,KJV,and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it ,now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man,1,MRK.4
1111,MRK,4,KJV,but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples,whose image and superscription hath it,1,MRK.4
1112,MRK,4,KJV,and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side,and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks,1,MRK.4
1113,MRK,4,KJV,and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship,brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all,1,MRK.4
1114,MRK,4,KJV,and there were also with him other little ships,then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat,1,MRK.4
1115,MRK,4,KJV,and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it,1,MRK.4
1116,MRK,4,KJV,and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish,the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe,1,MRK.4
1117,MRK,4,KJV,and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still,for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak,1,MRK.4
1118,MRK,4,KJV,and the wind ceased and there was a great calm,and it was the third hour and they crucified him,1,MRK.4
1119,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them why are ye so fearful,and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day,1,MRK.4
1120,MRK,4,KJV,how is it that ye have no faith,and who gave thee this authority,1,MRK.4
1121,MRK,4,KJV,and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him,of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities,1,MRK.4
1166,MRK,6,KJV,and he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him,and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon,1,MRK.6
1167,MRK,6,KJV,and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things,and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents,1,MRK.6
1168,MRK,6,KJV,and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands,let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready,1,MRK.6
1169,MRK,6,KJV,is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon,and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us,1,MRK.6
1170,MRK,6,KJV,and are not his sisters here with us,these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god,1,MRK.6
1171,MRK,6,KJV,and they were offended at him,unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into,1,MRK.6
1172,MRK,6,KJV,but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house,and he went round about the villages teaching,1,MRK.6
1173,MRK,6,KJV,and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them ,insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also,1,MRK.6
1174,MRK,6,KJV,and he marvelled because of their unbelief,my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee,1,MRK.6
1175,MRK,6,KJV,and he went round about the villages teaching,and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake,1,MRK.6
1176,MRK,6,KJV,and he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats,and in that day ye shall ask me nothing,1,MRK.6
1177,MRK,6,KJV,and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place,and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do,1,MRK.6
1178,MRK,6,KJV,and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them,therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly,1,MRK.6
1179,MRK,6,KJV,verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city,and he entered into one of the ships which was simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land,1,MRK.6
1180,MRK,6,KJV,and they went out and preached that men should repent,nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you,1,MRK.6
1181,MRK,6,KJV,and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him,for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer,1,MRK.6
1182,MRK,6,KJV,others said that it is elias,and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem,1,MRK.6
1183,MRK,6,KJV,and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets,for he that is dead is freed from sin,1,MRK.6
1184,MRK,6,KJV,but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead,and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them,1,MRK.6
1185,MRK,6,KJV,for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her,and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit,1,MRK.6
1186,MRK,6,KJV,for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife,and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,1,MRK.6
1187,MRK,6,KJV,therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly,is not this the carpenters son,1,MRK.6
1188,MRK,6,KJV,and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of galilee and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee,jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon,1,MRK.6
1189,MRK,6,KJV,and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom,and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them,1,MRK.6
1190,MRK,6,KJV,and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask,and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread,1,MRK.6
1191,MRK,6,KJV,and she said the head of john the baptist,but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in,1,MRK.6
1192,MRK,6,KJV,and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist,for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god,1,MRK.6
1193,MRK,6,KJV,and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her,grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love,1,MRK.6
1194,MRK,6,KJV,and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother,god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged,1,MRK.6
1195,MRK,6,KJV,and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb,for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth,1,MRK.6
1196,MRK,6,KJV,and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught,and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched,1,MRK.6
1197,MRK,6,KJV,and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat,and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight,1,MRK.6
1198,MRK,6,KJV,and they departed into a desert place by ship privately,the first epistle unto the thessalonians was written from athens,1,MRK.6
1199,MRK,6,KJV,and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him,then said they all art thou then the son of god,1,MRK.6
1200,MRK,6,KJV,and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things,and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth,1,MRK.6
1201,MRK,6,KJV,and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat,but ye have made it a den of thieves,1,MRK.6
1202,MRK,6,KJV,he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat,and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed,1,MRK.6
1203,MRK,6,KJV,and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat,even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church,1,MRK.6
1204,MRK,6,KJV,he saith unto them how many loaves have ye,i tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three,1,MRK.6
1205,MRK,6,KJV,and when they knew they say five and two fishes,and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize,1,MRK.6
1206,MRK,6,KJV,and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass,do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain,1,MRK.6
1207,MRK,6,KJV,and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties,but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him,1,MRK.6
1208,MRK,6,KJV,and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all,and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest,1,MRK.6
1209,MRK,6,KJV,and they did all eat and were filled,now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt,1,MRK.6
1210,MRK,6,KJV,and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes,jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things,1,MRK.6
1211,MRK,6,KJV,and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men,and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives,1,MRK.6
1212,MRK,6,KJV,and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people,why do ye not understand my speech,1,MRK.6
1213,MRK,6,KJV,and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray,beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god,1,MRK.6
1214,MRK,6,KJV,and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land,for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee,1,MRK.6
1215,MRK,6,KJV,and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them,but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question,1,MRK.6
1216,MRK,6,KJV,but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled,seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also,1,MRK.6
1217,MRK,6,KJV,and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid,who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec,1,MRK.6
1218,MRK,6,KJV,and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered,verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,1,MRK.6
1219,MRK,6,KJV,for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened,so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free,1,MRK.6
1220,MRK,6,KJV,and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty,1,MRK.6
1221,MRK,6,KJV,and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was,these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me,1,MRK.6
1222,MRK,6,KJV,and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole,seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect,1,MRK.6
1422,MRK,12,KJV,and he began to speak unto them by parables,but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,1,MRK.12
1423,MRK,12,KJV,a certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country,yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me,1,MRK.12
1424,MRK,12,KJV,and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard,and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods,1,MRK.12
1425,MRK,12,KJV,and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty,therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also,1,MRK.12
1426,MRK,12,KJV,and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled,for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband,1,MRK.12
1427,MRK,12,KJV,and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some,and i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which laboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life,1,MRK.12
1428,MRK,12,KJV,having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son,he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not,1,MRK.12
1429,MRK,12,KJV,but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours,howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them,1,MRK.12
1430,MRK,12,KJV,and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard,for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you,1,MRK.12
1431,MRK,12,KJV,what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do,i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning,1,MRK.12
1432,MRK,12,KJV,he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others,for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly,1,MRK.12
1433,MRK,12,KJV,and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him ,1,MRK.12
1434,MRK,12,KJV,and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way,they say unto him the first,1,MRK.12
1435,MRK,12,KJV,and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words,others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil,1,MRK.12
1436,MRK,12,KJV,and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not,ye cannot serve god and mammon,1,MRK.12
1437,MRK,12,KJV,shall we give or shall we not give,and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great,1,MRK.12
1438,MRK,12,KJV,but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me,and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it,1,MRK.12
1439,MRK,12,KJV,bring me a penny that i may see it and they brought it ,jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence,1,MRK.12
1440,MRK,12,KJV,and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription,wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection,1,MRK.12
1441,MRK,12,KJV,and they said unto him caesars,but rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto you,1,MRK.12
1442,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you,1,MRK.12
1443,MRK,12,KJV,then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money,1,MRK.12
1444,MRK,12,KJV,now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed,watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation,1,MRK.12
1445,MRK,12,KJV,and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise,and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat,1,MRK.12
1446,MRK,12,KJV,and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also,abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness,1,MRK.12
1447,MRK,12,KJV,in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them,abstain from all appearance of evil,1,MRK.12
1448,MRK,12,KJV,for the seven had her to wife,but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,1,MRK.12
1449,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god,we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth,1,MRK.12
1450,MRK,12,KJV,for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven,then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done,1,MRK.12
1451,MRK,12,KJV,and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry having damnation because they have cast off their first faith,1,MRK.12
1452,MRK,12,KJV,he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err,and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house,1,MRK.12
1453,MRK,12,KJV,and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all,and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful,1,MRK.12
1454,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment,because he saith whither i go ye cannot come,1,MRK.12
1455,MRK,12,KJV,and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be,1,MRK.12
1456,MRK,12,KJV,there is none other commandment greater than these,for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be,1,MRK.12
1457,MRK,12,KJV,and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen,1,MRK.12
1458,MRK,12,KJV,and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god,and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission,1,MRK.12
1459,MRK,12,KJV,and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david,bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,1,MRK.12
1460,MRK,12,KJV,for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel,1,MRK.12
1461,MRK,12,KJV,david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son,and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james,1,MRK.12
1462,MRK,12,KJV,and the common people heard him gladly,and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith,1,MRK.12
1463,MRK,12,KJV,and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation,and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee,1,MRK.12
1464,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much,and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him,1,MRK.12
1465,MRK,12,KJV,and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing,for they were about five thousand men,1,MRK.12
1466,MRK,12,KJV,and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living,set your affection on things above not on things on the earth,1,MRK.12
1622,MRK,16,KJV,and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him,and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself ,1,MRK.16
1623,MRK,16,KJV,and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun,and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt,1,MRK.16
1624,MRK,16,KJV,and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre,now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,1,MRK.16
1625,MRK,16,KJV,and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great,and there are differences of administrations but the same lord,1,MRK.16
1626,MRK,16,KJV,and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted,as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground,1,MRK.16
1627,MRK,16,KJV,and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him,but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here,1,MRK.16
1628,MRK,16,KJV,but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you,now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name,1,MRK.16
1629,MRK,16,KJV,and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid,and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled,1,MRK.16
1630,MRK,16,KJV,now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils,and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man,1,MRK.16
1631,MRK,16,KJV,and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept,but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest,1,MRK.16
1632,MRK,16,KJV,and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not,but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking,1,MRK.16
1633,MRK,16,KJV,after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country,and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father,1,MRK.16
1634,MRK,16,KJV,and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,1,MRK.16
1635,MRK,16,KJV,afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen,then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,1,MRK.16
1636,MRK,16,KJV,and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all,1,MRK.16
1637,MRK,16,KJV,he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned,bid her therefore that she help me,1,MRK.16
1638,MRK,16,KJV,and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover,to his own master he standeth or falleth,1,MRK.16
1639,MRK,16,KJV,so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god,when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha,1,MRK.16
1640,MRK,16,KJV,and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following,and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness for to see,1,MRK.16
1701,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed,this is the third time i am coming to you,1,LUK.2
1702,LUK,2,KJV,and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed every one into his own city,then the disciples went away again unto their own home,1,LUK.2
1703,LUK,2,KJV,and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child,he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still,1,LUK.2
1704,LUK,2,KJV,and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered,and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican,1,LUK.2
1705,LUK,2,KJV,and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn,rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation,1,LUK.2
1706,LUK,2,KJV,and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night,for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,1,LUK.2
1707,LUK,2,KJV,and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid,wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate,1,LUK.2
1708,LUK,2,KJV,and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him,1,LUK.2
1709,LUK,2,KJV,for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord,they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while,1,LUK.2
1710,LUK,2,KJV,and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger,but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk,1,LUK.2
1711,LUK,2,KJV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men,then said they unto him where is he,1,LUK.2
1712,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us,but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss,1,LUK.2
1713,LUK,2,KJV,and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger,and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth,1,LUK.2
1714,LUK,2,KJV,and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child,these things i command you that ye love one another,1,LUK.2
1715,LUK,2,KJV,and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds,ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin,1,LUK.2
1716,LUK,2,KJV,but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart,and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises,1,LUK.2
1717,LUK,2,KJV,and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them,now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him,1,LUK.2
1718,LUK,2,KJV,and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb,shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus,1,LUK.2
1719,LUK,2,KJV,and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews,1,LUK.2
1720,LUK,2,KJV,and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him,therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also,1,LUK.2
1721,LUK,2,KJV,and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ,then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto,1,LUK.2
1722,LUK,2,KJV,and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel,and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up,1,LUK.2
1723,LUK,2,KJV,and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him,now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever,1,LUK.2
1724,LUK,2,KJV,and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed,and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all,1,LUK.2
1725,LUK,2,KJV,and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day,take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven,1,LUK.2
1726,LUK,2,KJV,and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem,and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon,1,LUK.2
1727,LUK,2,KJV,and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth,we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father knowing brethren beloved your election of god,1,LUK.2
1728,LUK,2,KJV,and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him,whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god,1,LUK.2
1729,LUK,2,KJV,now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover,then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest,1,LUK.2
1730,LUK,2,KJV,and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast,for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria,1,LUK.2
1731,LUK,2,KJV,and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it ,here is the patience and the faith of the saints,1,LUK.2
1732,LUK,2,KJV,but they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance,then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner,1,LUK.2
1733,LUK,2,KJV,and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him,and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus,1,LUK.2
1734,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions,but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses,1,LUK.2
1735,LUK,2,KJV,and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers,at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god,1,LUK.2
1736,LUK,2,KJV,and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us,when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel,1,LUK.2
1737,LUK,2,KJV,behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing,and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected,1,LUK.2
1738,LUK,2,KJV,and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me,if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet,1,LUK.2
1739,LUK,2,KJV,wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business,therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock,1,LUK.2
1740,LUK,2,KJV,and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them,and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid,1,LUK.2
1741,LUK,2,KJV,and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart,and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives,1,LUK.2
1742,LUK,2,KJV,and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and man,and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you,1,LUK.2
1760,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil,of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand,1,LUK.4
1761,LUK,4,KJV,and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered,and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul,1,LUK.4
1762,LUK,4,KJV,and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that it be made bread,greet them that love us in the faith,1,LUK.4
1763,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god,for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner,1,LUK.4
1764,LUK,4,KJV,and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god,1,LUK.4
1765,LUK,4,KJV,and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it,o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me,1,LUK.4
1766,LUK,4,KJV,if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine,and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me,1,LUK.4
1767,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve,nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us,1,LUK.4
1768,LUK,4,KJV,and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,1,LUK.4
1769,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god,and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words,1,LUK.4
1770,LUK,4,KJV,and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season,and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful,1,LUK.4
1771,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about,use hospitality one to another without grudging,1,LUK.4
1772,LUK,4,KJV,and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all,when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman,1,LUK.4
1773,LUK,4,KJV,and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read,put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,1,LUK.4
1774,LUK,4,KJV,and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias,he that hateth me hateth my father also,1,LUK.4
1775,LUK,4,KJV,and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down,wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god,1,LUK.4
1776,LUK,4,KJV,and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him,do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles,1,LUK.4
1777,LUK,4,KJV,and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears,but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me,1,LUK.4
1778,LUK,4,KJV,and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth,and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father,1,LUK.4
1779,LUK,4,KJV,and they said is not this josephs son,if any man have ears to hear let him hear,1,LUK.4
1780,LUK,4,KJV,and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country,now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing,1,LUK.4
1781,LUK,4,KJV,and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country,and jesus answering them said have ye not read so much as this what david did when himself was an hungred and they which were with him how he went into the house of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone,1,LUK.4
1782,LUK,4,KJV,but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow ,when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life,1,LUK.4
1783,LUK,4,KJV,and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian,then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe,1,LUK.4
1784,LUK,4,KJV,and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong,for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman,1,LUK.4
1785,LUK,4,KJV,but he passing through the midst of them went his way and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days,woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes,1,LUK.4
1786,LUK,4,KJV,and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power,be ye therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour,1,LUK.4
1787,LUK,4,KJV,and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth,and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness,1,LUK.4
1788,LUK,4,KJV,art thou come to destroy us,then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children,1,LUK.4
1789,LUK,4,KJV,i know thee who thou art the holy one of god,yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me,1,LUK.4
1790,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him,but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit,1,LUK.4
1791,LUK,4,KJV,and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not,for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord,1,LUK.4
1792,LUK,4,KJV,and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out,therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved,1,LUK.4
1793,LUK,4,KJV,and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about,and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia,1,LUK.4
1794,LUK,4,KJV,and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house,and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean,1,LUK.4
1795,LUK,4,KJV,and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her,and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus,1,LUK.4
1796,LUK,4,KJV,and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them,but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him,1,LUK.4
1797,LUK,4,KJV,now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them,then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone,1,LUK.4
1798,LUK,4,KJV,and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god,and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying maid arise,1,LUK.4
1799,LUK,4,KJV,and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ,and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying,1,LUK.4
1800,LUK,4,KJV,and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them,now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you,1,LUK.4
1801,LUK,4,KJV,and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent,and his sisters are they not all with us,1,LUK.4
1802,LUK,4,KJV,and he preached in the synagogues of galilee,of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath,1,LUK.4
2013,LUK,9,KJV,then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases,the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth,1,LUK.9
2014,LUK,9,KJV,and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick,as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast,1,LUK.9
2015,LUK,9,KJV,and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece,and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,1,LUK.9
2016,LUK,9,KJV,and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart,but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state,1,LUK.9
2017,LUK,9,KJV,and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them,and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again,1,LUK.9
2018,LUK,9,KJV,and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every where,and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication,1,LUK.9
2019,LUK,9,KJV,now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again,and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven,1,LUK.9
2020,LUK,9,KJV,and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things,when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus,1,LUK.9
2021,LUK,9,KJV,and he desired to see him,the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven,1,LUK.9
2022,LUK,9,KJV,and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done,when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was,1,LUK.9
2023,LUK,9,KJV,and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida,these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue,1,LUK.9
2024,LUK,9,KJV,and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing,and they departed into a desert place by ship privately,1,LUK.9
2025,LUK,9,KJV,and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place,this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you,1,LUK.9
2026,LUK,9,KJV,but he said unto them give ye them to eat,i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture,1,LUK.9
2027,LUK,9,KJV,and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people,and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself,1,LUK.9
2028,LUK,9,KJV,for they were about five thousand men,and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize,1,LUK.9
2029,LUK,9,KJV,and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company,for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you,1,LUK.9
2030,LUK,9,KJV,and they did so and made them all sit down,and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts,1,LUK.9
2031,LUK,9,KJV,then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude,and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days,1,LUK.9
2032,LUK,9,KJV,and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets,give us day by day our daily bread,1,LUK.9
2033,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am,now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover,1,LUK.9
2034,LUK,9,KJV,they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again,for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well,1,LUK.9
2035,LUK,9,KJV,he said unto them but whom say ye that i am,and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better,1,LUK.9
2036,LUK,9,KJV,peter answering said the christ of god,now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh,1,LUK.9
2037,LUK,9,KJV,and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day,then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,1,LUK.9
2038,LUK,9,KJV,and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me,then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid,1,LUK.9
2039,LUK,9,KJV,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it,wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood,1,LUK.9
2040,LUK,9,KJV,for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away,we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation,1,LUK.9
2041,LUK,9,KJV,for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels,and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth,1,LUK.9
2042,LUK,9,KJV,but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god,and he said unto me it is done,1,LUK.9
2043,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray,i speak as a fool i am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft,1,LUK.9
2044,LUK,9,KJV,and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering,but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof,1,LUK.9
2045,LUK,9,KJV,and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem,greet them that be of the household of narcissus which are in the lord,1,LUK.9
2046,LUK,9,KJV,but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him,now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god,1,LUK.9
2047,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said,all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesars household,1,LUK.9
2048,LUK,9,KJV,while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud,for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god,1,LUK.9
2049,LUK,9,KJV,and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him,blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them,1,LUK.9
2050,LUK,9,KJV,and when the voice was past jesus was found alone,and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him,1,LUK.9
2051,LUK,9,KJV,and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen,wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf,1,LUK.9
2052,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him,and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh,1,LUK.9
2053,LUK,9,KJV,and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child,i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully,1,LUK.9
2054,LUK,9,KJV,and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him,so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid,1,LUK.9
2055,LUK,9,KJV,and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation,1,LUK.9
2056,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you,philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus,1,LUK.9
2057,LUK,9,KJV,and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him ,then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine,1,LUK.9
2058,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father,for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come,1,LUK.9
2059,LUK,9,KJV,and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god,and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me,1,LUK.9
2060,LUK,9,KJV,but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men,having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son,1,LUK.9
2061,LUK,9,KJV,but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying,wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets,1,LUK.9
2062,LUK,9,KJV,then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest,or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of peace ,1,LUK.9
2063,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great,he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away,1,LUK.9
2064,LUK,9,KJV,and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us,and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus,1,LUK.9
2065,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us,these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing,1,LUK.9
2066,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him,for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness,1,LUK.9
2067,LUK,9,KJV,and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all,1,LUK.9
2068,LUK,9,KJV,and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did,for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again,1,LUK.9
2069,LUK,9,KJV,but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true,1,LUK.9
2070,LUK,9,KJV,for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them and they went to another village,and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth,1,LUK.9
2071,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest,and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds,1,LUK.9
2072,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head,for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things,1,LUK.9
2073,LUK,9,KJV,and he said unto another follow me,woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core,1,LUK.9
2074,LUK,9,KJV,but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father,therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven,1,LUK.9
2075,LUK,9,KJV,jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god,dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation,1,LUK.9
2076,LUK,9,KJV,and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house,so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses,1,LUK.9
2077,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god,i receive not honour from men,1,LUK.9
2224,LUK,13,KJV,there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices,women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth,1,LUK.13
2225,LUK,13,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things,he denied it and said i am not,1,LUK.13
2226,LUK,13,KJV,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simons son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor,1,LUK.13
2227,LUK,13,KJV,or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem,and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me,1,LUK.13
2228,LUK,13,KJV,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish,for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints,1,LUK.13
2229,LUK,13,KJV,he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none,and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever,1,LUK.13
2230,LUK,13,KJV,then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground,and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep,1,LUK.13
2231,LUK,13,KJV,and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down,if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death,1,LUK.13
2232,LUK,13,KJV,and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle not which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men,1,LUK.13
2233,LUK,13,KJV,and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself ,and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season,1,LUK.13
2234,LUK,13,KJV,and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity,and jesus said somebody hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me,1,LUK.13
2235,LUK,13,KJV,and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god,for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek,1,LUK.13
2236,LUK,13,KJV,and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day,and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life,1,LUK.13
2237,LUK,13,KJV,the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering,let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you,1,LUK.13
2238,LUK,13,KJV,and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day,and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god,1,LUK.13
2239,LUK,13,KJV,and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him,through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear,1,LUK.13
2240,LUK,13,KJV,then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like,if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them,1,LUK.13
2241,LUK,13,KJV,and whereunto shall i resemble it,but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews,1,LUK.13
2242,LUK,13,KJV,it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it,and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone,1,LUK.13
2243,LUK,13,KJV,and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god,but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed,1,LUK.13
2244,LUK,13,KJV,it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened,but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire,1,LUK.13
2245,LUK,13,KJV,and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem,and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him,1,LUK.13
2246,LUK,13,KJV,then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved,and he that was dead sat up and began to speak,1,LUK.13
2247,LUK,13,KJV,and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able,and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty,1,LUK.13
2248,LUK,13,KJV,when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets,for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape,1,LUK.13
2249,LUK,13,KJV,but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity,then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days,1,LUK.13
2250,LUK,13,KJV,there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out,and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed that call not thou common,1,LUK.13
2251,LUK,13,KJV,and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god,and the jews also assented saying that these things were so,1,LUK.13
2252,LUK,13,KJV,and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last,for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression,1,LUK.13
2253,LUK,13,KJV,the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee,jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither,1,LUK.13
2254,LUK,13,KJV,and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected,recompense to no man evil for evil,1,LUK.13
2255,LUK,13,KJV,nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem,jesus went unto the mount of olives,1,LUK.13
2256,LUK,13,KJV,o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,philip saith unto him come and see,1,LUK.13
2377,LUK,18,KJV,and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary,and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty,1,LUK.18
2378,LUK,18,KJV,and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me,he that hath ears to hear let him hear,1,LUK.18
2379,LUK,18,KJV,and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith,but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation,1,LUK.18
2380,LUK,18,KJV,and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them,and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests,1,LUK.18
2381,LUK,18,KJV,i tell you that he will avenge them speedily,then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee,1,LUK.18
2382,LUK,18,KJV,nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth,the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes,1,LUK.18
2383,LUK,18,KJV,and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican,the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife,1,LUK.18
2384,LUK,18,KJV,the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican,either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she hath found it she calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost,1,LUK.18
2385,LUK,18,KJV,i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess,and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment,1,LUK.18
2386,LUK,18,KJV,and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner,and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations,1,LUK.18
2387,LUK,18,KJV,i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted,and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings,1,LUK.18
2388,LUK,18,KJV,and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them,and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all ,1,LUK.18
2389,LUK,18,KJV,but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god,and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete,1,LUK.18
2390,LUK,18,KJV,verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein,and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul,1,LUK.18
2391,LUK,18,KJV,and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life,what advantage then hath the jew,1,LUK.18
2392,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good,and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth,1,LUK.18
2393,LUK,18,KJV,none is good save one that is god,now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha,1,LUK.18
2394,LUK,18,KJV,thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother,and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel,1,LUK.18
2395,LUK,18,KJV,and he said all these have i kept from my youth up,but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son of man be,1,LUK.18
2396,LUK,18,KJV,now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me,and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him,1,LUK.18
2397,LUK,18,KJV,and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich,we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying,1,LUK.18
2398,LUK,18,KJV,and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,and behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy,1,LUK.18
2399,LUK,18,KJV,and they that heard it said who then can be saved,i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also,1,LUK.18
2400,LUK,18,KJV,and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god,and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat,1,LUK.18
2401,LUK,18,KJV,then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee,or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you,1,LUK.18
2402,LUK,18,KJV,and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting,for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,1,LUK.18
2403,LUK,18,KJV,then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished,and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god,1,LUK.18
2404,LUK,18,KJV,for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again,and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound,1,LUK.18
2405,LUK,18,KJV,and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken,and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals,1,LUK.18
2406,LUK,18,KJV,and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant,for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things,1,LUK.18
2407,LUK,18,KJV,and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by,them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear,1,LUK.18
2408,LUK,18,KJV,and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me,and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the priests which did so,1,LUK.18
2409,LUK,18,KJV,and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me,so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses,1,LUK.18
2410,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee,and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all,1,LUK.18
2411,LUK,18,KJV,and he said lord that i may receive my sight,for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection,1,LUK.18
2412,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee,the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here,1,LUK.18
2413,LUK,18,KJV,and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god,for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,1,LUK.18
2655,LUK,24,KJV,now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them,the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes,1,LUK.24
2656,LUK,24,KJV,and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre,and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath,1,LUK.24
2657,LUK,24,KJV,and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus,then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well,1,LUK.24
2658,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead,and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid,1,LUK.24
2659,LUK,24,KJV,he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again,ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do,1,LUK.24
2660,LUK,24,KJV,and they remembered his words and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest,and gallio cared for none of those things,1,LUK.24
2661,LUK,24,KJV,it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles,they say unto him we are able,1,LUK.24
2662,LUK,24,KJV,and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not,and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men,1,LUK.24
2663,LUK,24,KJV,then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass,but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things,1,LUK.24
2664,LUK,24,KJV,and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs,and when they were gone over they came into the land of gennesaret,1,LUK.24
2665,LUK,24,KJV,and they talked together of all these things which had happened,and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin,1,LUK.24
2666,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them,he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge,1,LUK.24
2667,LUK,24,KJV,but their eyes were holden that they should not know him,and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh,1,LUK.24
2668,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad,this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge,1,LUK.24
2669,LUK,24,KJV,and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days,and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple,1,LUK.24
2670,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them what things,they say unto him the son of david,1,LUK.24
2671,LUK,24,KJV,and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him,and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever,1,LUK.24
2672,LUK,24,KJV,but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done,let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another,1,LUK.24
2673,LUK,24,KJV,yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive,and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living,1,LUK.24
2674,LUK,24,KJV,and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not,this is the true god and eternal life,1,LUK.24
2675,LUK,24,KJV,then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory,i am that bread of life,1,LUK.24
2676,LUK,24,KJV,and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself,husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them,1,LUK.24
2677,LUK,24,KJV,and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further,but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god,1,LUK.24
2678,LUK,24,KJV,but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent,verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him,1,LUK.24
2679,LUK,24,KJV,and he went in to tarry with them,but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent,1,LUK.24
2680,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them,but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain,1,LUK.24
2681,LUK,24,KJV,and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight,now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin,1,LUK.24
2682,LUK,24,KJV,and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures,and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many,1,LUK.24
2683,LUK,24,KJV,and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon,and this is love that we walk after his commandments,1,LUK.24
2684,LUK,24,KJV,and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread,and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloke also,1,LUK.24
2685,LUK,24,KJV,and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you,and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews,1,LUK.24
2686,LUK,24,KJV,but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit,furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia,1,LUK.24
2687,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them why are ye troubled,i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive,1,LUK.24
2688,LUK,24,KJV,and why do thoughts arise in your hearts,then said they it is his angel,1,LUK.24
2689,LUK,24,KJV,behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have,jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave,1,LUK.24
2690,LUK,24,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet,be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners,1,LUK.24
2691,LUK,24,KJV,and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat,for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens,1,LUK.24
2692,LUK,24,KJV,and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb,now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors,1,LUK.24
2693,LUK,24,KJV,and he took it and did eat before them,and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child,1,LUK.24
2694,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me,but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them,1,LUK.24
2695,LUK,24,KJV,then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem,be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful,1,LUK.24
2696,LUK,24,KJV,and ye are witnesses of these things,and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest,1,LUK.24
2697,LUK,24,KJV,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high,then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him,1,LUK.24
2698,LUK,24,KJV,and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them,let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband,1,LUK.24
2699,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven,and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized,1,LUK.24
2700,LUK,24,KJV,and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god,and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me,1,LUK.24
2754,JHN,2,KJV,and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage,and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also,1,JHN.2
2755,JHN,2,KJV,and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine,then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience,1,JHN.2
2756,JHN,2,KJV,jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee,for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord,1,JHN.2
2757,JHN,2,KJV,mine hour is not yet come,but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him,1,JHN.2
2758,JHN,2,KJV,his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it ,for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself,1,JHN.2
2759,JHN,2,KJV,and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece,and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am,1,JHN.2
2760,JHN,2,KJV,jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water,but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god,1,JHN.2
2761,JHN,2,KJV,and they filled them up to the brim,little children yet a little while i am with you,1,JHN.2
2762,JHN,2,KJV,and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast,and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,1,JHN.2
2763,JHN,2,KJV,when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now,give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved,1,JHN.2
2764,JHN,2,KJV,this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him,and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught,1,JHN.2
2765,JHN,2,KJV,after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days,art thou come to destroy us,1,JHN.2
2766,JHN,2,KJV,and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,1,JHN.2
2767,JHN,2,KJV,and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord,1,JHN.2
2768,JHN,2,KJV,then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things,and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein,1,JHN.2
2769,JHN,2,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up,and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle,1,JHN.2
2770,JHN,2,KJV,then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days,and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon never man sat loose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why do ye this,1,JHN.2
2771,JHN,2,KJV,but he spake of the temple of his body,then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly,1,JHN.2
2772,JHN,2,KJV,when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,1,JHN.2
2773,JHN,2,KJV,now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did,for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins,1,JHN.2
2774,JHN,2,KJV,but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man,behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children,1,JHN.2
2983,JHN,7,KJV,after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him,ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy,1,JHN.7
2984,JHN,7,KJV,now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand,for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth,1,JHN.7
2985,JHN,7,KJV,his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest,but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him,1,JHN.7
2986,JHN,7,KJV,for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly,and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god,1,JHN.7
2987,JHN,7,KJV,if thou do these things shew thyself to the world,and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep,1,JHN.7
2988,JHN,7,KJV,for neither did his brethren believe in him,behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds,1,JHN.7
2989,JHN,7,KJV,then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready,much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god,1,JHN.7
2990,JHN,7,KJV,the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil,hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error,1,JHN.7
2991,JHN,7,KJV,go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come,and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength,1,JHN.7
2992,JHN,7,KJV,when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee,and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague,1,JHN.7
2993,JHN,7,KJV,but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret,then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw,1,JHN.7
2994,JHN,7,KJV,then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he,thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance,1,JHN.7
2995,JHN,7,KJV,and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it,1,JHN.7
2996,JHN,7,KJV,howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews,but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people,1,JHN.7
2997,JHN,7,KJV,now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught,dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints,1,JHN.7
2998,JHN,7,KJV,and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned,and they did all eat and were filled,1,JHN.7
2999,JHN,7,KJV,jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me,but i speak this by permission and not of commandment,1,JHN.7
3000,JHN,7,KJV,if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself,and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled,1,JHN.7
3001,JHN,7,KJV,he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him,so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty,1,JHN.7
3002,JHN,7,KJV,did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law,for this man doeth many miracles,1,JHN.7
3003,JHN,7,KJV,why go ye about to kill me,but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest,1,JHN.7
3004,JHN,7,KJV,the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee,take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness,1,JHN.7
3005,JHN,7,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel,and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters ,1,JHN.7
3006,JHN,7,KJV,moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man,we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is,1,JHN.7
3007,JHN,7,KJV,if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day,now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place,1,JHN.7
3008,JHN,7,KJV,judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment,and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight,1,JHN.7
3009,JHN,7,KJV,then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill,therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift,1,JHN.7
3010,JHN,7,KJV,but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him,then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him,1,JHN.7
3011,JHN,7,KJV,do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ,and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning,1,JHN.7
3012,JHN,7,KJV,howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is,at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes,1,JHN.7
3013,JHN,7,KJV,then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not,but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils,1,JHN.7
3014,JHN,7,KJV,but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me,whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also ,1,JHN.7
3015,JHN,7,KJV,then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come,this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him,1,JHN.7
3016,JHN,7,KJV,and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done,and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself,1,JHN.7
3017,JHN,7,KJV,the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him,and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him,1,JHN.7
3018,JHN,7,KJV,then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me,so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief,1,JHN.7
3019,JHN,7,KJV,ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come,and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil,1,JHN.7
3020,JHN,7,KJV,then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him,jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work,1,JHN.7
3021,JHN,7,KJV,will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles,and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god,1,JHN.7
3022,JHN,7,KJV,what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come,examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves,1,JHN.7
3023,JHN,7,KJV,in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink,and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law,1,JHN.7
3024,JHN,7,KJV,he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples,1,JHN.7
3025,JHN,7,KJV,but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet,and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us the passover that we may eat,1,JHN.7
3026,JHN,7,KJV,others said this is the christ,and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh,1,JHN.7
3027,JHN,7,KJV,but some said shall christ come out of galilee,for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect,1,JHN.7
3028,JHN,7,KJV,hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was,fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known,1,JHN.7
3029,JHN,7,KJV,so there was a division among the people because of him,ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said,1,JHN.7
3030,JHN,7,KJV,and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him,remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound,1,JHN.7
3031,JHN,7,KJV,then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him,be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord,1,JHN.7
3032,JHN,7,KJV,the officers answered never man spake like this man,and in his name shall the gentiles trust,1,JHN.7
3033,JHN,7,KJV,then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived,and there was great joy in that city,1,JHN.7
3034,JHN,7,KJV,have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him,for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be,1,JHN.7
3035,JHN,7,KJV,but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed,and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid,1,JHN.7
3036,JHN,7,KJV,nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth,but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet,1,JHN.7
3037,JHN,7,KJV,they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee,and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge,1,JHN.7
3038,JHN,7,KJV,search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet,and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked,1,JHN.7
3039,JHN,7,KJV,and every man went unto his own house,then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said,1,JHN.7
3040,JHN,8,KJV,jesus went unto the mount of olives,how long shall i suffer you,1,JHN.8
3041,JHN,8,KJV,and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them,then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt,1,JHN.8
3042,JHN,8,KJV,and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act,for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth,1,JHN.8
3043,JHN,8,KJV,now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou,so then death worketh in us but life in you,1,JHN.8
3044,JHN,8,KJV,this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him,for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry,1,JHN.8
3045,JHN,8,KJV,but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not ,likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save,1,JHN.8
3046,JHN,8,KJV,so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her,and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me,1,JHN.8
3047,JHN,8,KJV,and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground,now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches,1,JHN.8
3048,JHN,8,KJV,and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst,but where sin abounded grace did much more abound that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord,1,JHN.8
3049,JHN,8,KJV,when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers,be not wise in your own conceits,1,JHN.8
3050,JHN,8,KJV,and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ,1,JHN.8
3051,JHN,8,KJV,then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life,and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do,1,JHN.8
3052,JHN,8,KJV,the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true,but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses,1,JHN.8
3053,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go,abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good,1,JHN.8
3054,JHN,8,KJV,ye judge after the flesh i judge no man,and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied,1,JHN.8
3055,JHN,8,KJV,and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me,and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not,1,JHN.8
3056,JHN,8,KJV,it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true,is not his mother called mary,1,JHN.8
3057,JHN,8,KJV,i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me,for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy,1,JHN.8
3058,JHN,8,KJV,then said they unto him where is thy father,and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go,1,JHN.8
3059,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also,and he arose and came to his father,1,JHN.8
3060,JHN,8,KJV,these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come,but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him,1,JHN.8
3061,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come,all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out,1,JHN.8
3062,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews will he kill himself,marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again,1,JHN.8
3063,JHN,8,KJV,because he saith whither i go ye cannot come,let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law,1,JHN.8
3064,JHN,8,KJV,and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world,for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also,1,JHN.8
3065,JHN,8,KJV,i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins,but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils,1,JHN.8
3066,JHN,8,KJV,then said they unto him who art thou,but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe,1,JHN.8
3067,JHN,8,KJV,and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning,and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail,1,JHN.8
3068,JHN,8,KJV,i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him,then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat,1,JHN.8
3069,JHN,8,KJV,they understood not that he spake to them of the father,grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love,1,JHN.8
3070,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things,and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more,1,JHN.8
3071,JHN,8,KJV,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him,then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not,1,JHN.8
3072,JHN,8,KJV,as he spake these words many believed on him,and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years,1,JHN.8
3073,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free,and are not his sisters here with us,1,JHN.8
3074,JHN,8,KJV,they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free,others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles,1,JHN.8
3075,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin,and there arose certain and bare false witness against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands,1,JHN.8
3076,JHN,8,KJV,and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever,and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us,1,JHN.8
3077,JHN,8,KJV,if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed,be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness,1,JHN.8
3078,JHN,8,KJV,i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you,and he preached in the synagogues of galilee,1,JHN.8
3079,JHN,8,KJV,i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father,receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me,1,JHN.8
3080,JHN,8,KJV,they answered and said unto him abraham is our father,god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth,1,JHN.8
3081,JHN,8,KJV,jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham,by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come,1,JHN.8
3082,JHN,8,KJV,but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham,howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god,1,JHN.8
3083,JHN,8,KJV,ye do the deeds of your father,and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth,1,JHN.8
3084,JHN,8,KJV,then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god,but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god,1,JHN.8
3085,JHN,8,KJV,jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me,and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles,1,JHN.8
3086,JHN,8,KJV,why do ye not understand my speech,let all things be done unto edifying,1,JHN.8
3087,JHN,8,KJV,even because ye cannot hear my word,and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight,1,JHN.8
3088,JHN,8,KJV,ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do,the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born,1,JHN.8
3089,JHN,8,KJV,he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him,and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink,1,JHN.8
3090,JHN,8,KJV,when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it,but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer,1,JHN.8
3091,JHN,8,KJV,and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not,and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized,1,JHN.8
3092,JHN,8,KJV,which of you convinceth me of sin,this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work,1,JHN.8
3093,JHN,8,KJV,and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me,and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him ,1,JHN.8
3094,JHN,8,KJV,he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god,but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason ye in your hearts,1,JHN.8
3095,JHN,8,KJV,then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil,do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world,1,JHN.8
3096,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me,and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest,1,JHN.8
3097,JHN,8,KJV,and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth,and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the house,1,JHN.8
3098,JHN,8,KJV,verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death,and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul,1,JHN.8
3099,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil,for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season,1,JHN.8
3100,JHN,8,KJV,abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death,do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain,1,JHN.8
3101,JHN,8,KJV,art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead,and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he was a good man and a just the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god,1,JHN.8
3102,JHN,8,KJV,and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself,there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth,1,JHN.8
3103,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying,and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this,1,JHN.8
3104,JHN,8,KJV,your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad,why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart,1,JHN.8
3105,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham,and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way,1,JHN.8
3106,JHN,8,KJV,jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am,and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth,1,JHN.8
3107,JHN,8,KJV,then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by,and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them ,1,JHN.8
3196,JHN,11,KJV,now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha,take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee,1,JHN.11
3197,JHN,11,KJV,it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick,and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day,1,JHN.11
3198,JHN,11,KJV,when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby,he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife,1,JHN.11
3199,JHN,11,KJV,now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus,verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father,1,JHN.11
3200,JHN,11,KJV,when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was,and he began to speak unto them by parables,1,JHN.11
3201,JHN,11,KJV,then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again,and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day,1,JHN.11
3202,JHN,11,KJV,his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again,the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus,1,JHN.11
3203,JHN,11,KJV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day,but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven,1,JHN.11
3204,JHN,11,KJV,if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world,but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak,1,JHN.11
3205,JHN,11,KJV,but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him,and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples,1,JHN.11
3206,JHN,11,KJV,these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep,they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat,1,JHN.11
3207,JHN,11,KJV,then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well,and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot,1,JHN.11
3208,JHN,11,KJV,howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep,for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee,1,JHN.11
3209,JHN,11,KJV,then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead,but that which ye have already hold fast till i come,1,JHN.11
3210,JHN,11,KJV,and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him,and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works,1,JHN.11
3211,JHN,11,KJV,then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him,i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need,1,JHN.11
3212,JHN,11,KJV,then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already,and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them,1,JHN.11
3213,JHN,11,KJV,now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother,and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes mother laid and sick of a fever,1,JHN.11
3214,JHN,11,KJV,then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house,for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not god and are contrary to all men forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost,1,JHN.11
3215,JHN,11,KJV,then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died,and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me,1,JHN.11
3216,JHN,11,KJV,but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee,even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things,1,JHN.11
3217,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again,and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them,1,JHN.11
3218,JHN,11,KJV,martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day,and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us,1,JHN.11
3219,JHN,11,KJV,jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die,and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified,1,JHN.11
3220,JHN,11,KJV,she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world,the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me,1,JHN.11
3221,JHN,11,KJV,and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee,from whence then hath it tares,1,JHN.11
3222,JHN,11,KJV,as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him,peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre,1,JHN.11
3223,JHN,11,KJV,now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him,but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness,1,JHN.11
3224,JHN,11,KJV,the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there,do not even the publicans the same,1,JHN.11
3225,JHN,11,KJV,then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died,for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth,1,JHN.11
3226,JHN,11,KJV,when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him,and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them,1,JHN.11
3227,JHN,11,KJV,they said unto him lord come and see,and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear,1,JHN.11
3228,JHN,11,KJV,then said the jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died,then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him,1,JHN.11
3229,JHN,11,KJV,jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave,christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace,1,JHN.11
3230,JHN,11,KJV,it was a cave and a stone lay upon it,for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him,1,JHN.11
3231,JHN,11,KJV,jesus said take ye away the stone,and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea,1,JHN.11
3232,JHN,11,KJV,martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days,and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them,1,JHN.11
3233,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god,jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god,1,JHN.11
3234,JHN,11,KJV,then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid,and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise,1,JHN.11
3235,JHN,11,KJV,and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me,ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me,1,JHN.11
3236,JHN,11,KJV,and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me,then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me,1,JHN.11
3237,JHN,11,KJV,and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth,then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me,1,JHN.11
3238,JHN,11,KJV,and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin,and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years,1,JHN.11
3239,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go,for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be,1,JHN.11
3240,JHN,11,KJV,then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him,and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also,1,JHN.11
3241,JHN,11,KJV,but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done,watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong,1,JHN.11
3242,JHN,11,KJV,then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we,i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left,1,JHN.11
3243,JHN,11,KJV,for this man doeth many miracles,wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend,1,JHN.11
3244,JHN,11,KJV,if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation,for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father,1,JHN.11
3245,JHN,11,KJV,and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not,and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able,1,JHN.11
3246,JHN,11,KJV,and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad,to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth,1,JHN.11
3247,JHN,11,KJV,then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death,bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham,1,JHN.11
3248,JHN,11,KJV,jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples,and after they had tarried there a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles,1,JHN.11
3249,JHN,11,KJV,and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves,but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons,1,JHN.11
3250,JHN,11,KJV,then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast,and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light,1,JHN.11
3251,JHN,11,KJV,now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him,and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire,1,JHN.11
3300,JHN,13,KJV,now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end,by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh,1,JHN.13
3301,JHN,13,KJV,and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself,much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him,1,JHN.13
3302,JHN,13,KJV,after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded,we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified,1,JHN.13
3303,JHN,13,KJV,then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet,and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean,1,JHN.13
3304,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter,and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by,1,JHN.13
3305,JHN,13,KJV,peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet,and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last,1,JHN.13
3306,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me,the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment,1,JHN.13
3307,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head,but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land,1,JHN.13
3308,JHN,13,KJV,jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all,then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil,1,JHN.13
3309,JHN,13,KJV,for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean,now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out,1,JHN.13
3310,JHN,13,KJV,so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you,and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them,1,JHN.13
3311,JHN,13,KJV,ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am,this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin,1,JHN.13
3312,JHN,13,KJV,if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet,and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth,1,JHN.13
3313,JHN,13,KJV,for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you,and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus,1,JHN.13
3314,JHN,13,KJV,verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him,verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,1,JHN.13
3315,JHN,13,KJV,if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them,and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt,1,JHN.13
3316,JHN,13,KJV,i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me,and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment,1,JHN.13
3317,JHN,13,KJV,now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me,and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him,1,JHN.13
3318,JHN,13,KJV,when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me,then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ,1,JHN.13
3319,JHN,13,KJV,then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake,fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known,1,JHN.13
3320,JHN,13,KJV,now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved,and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein,1,JHN.13
3321,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake,and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god,1,JHN.13
3322,JHN,13,KJV,he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it,immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory,1,JHN.13
3323,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon,grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love,1,JHN.13
3324,JHN,13,KJV,and after the sop satan entered into him,and he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him,1,JHN.13
3325,JHN,13,KJV,then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly,now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever,1,JHN.13
3326,JHN,13,KJV,now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him,for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ,1,JHN.13
3327,JHN,13,KJV,for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor,and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to the lord,1,JHN.13
3328,JHN,13,KJV,he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night,for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul,1,JHN.13
3329,JHN,13,KJV,therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him,and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven,1,JHN.13
3330,JHN,13,KJV,if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him,he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me,1,JHN.13
3331,JHN,13,KJV,little children yet a little while i am with you,for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus,1,JHN.13
3332,JHN,13,KJV,ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you,the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved,1,JHN.13
3333,JHN,13,KJV,a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another,now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem,1,JHN.13
3334,JHN,13,KJV,by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another,and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him,1,JHN.13
3335,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou,art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle,1,JHN.13
3336,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards,then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him,1,JHN.13
3337,JHN,13,KJV,peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now,jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent,1,JHN.13
3338,JHN,13,KJV,i will lay down my life for thy sake,and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him,1,JHN.13
3339,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake,as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison,1,JHN.13
3340,JHN,13,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice,and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last,1,JHN.13
3341,JHN,14,KJV,let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me,and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing,1,JHN.14
3342,JHN,14,KJV,in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you,therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you,1,JHN.14
3343,JHN,14,KJV,i go to prepare a place for you,for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,1,JHN.14
3344,JHN,14,KJV,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also,then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come,1,JHN.14
3345,JHN,14,KJV,and whither i go ye know and the way ye know,and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you,1,JHN.14
3346,JHN,14,KJV,thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way,he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return,1,JHN.14
3347,JHN,14,KJV,jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me,jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake,1,JHN.14
3348,JHN,14,KJV,if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him,and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john,1,JHN.14
3349,JHN,14,KJV,philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us,and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge,1,JHN.14
3350,JHN,14,KJV,jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip,then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation,1,JHN.14
3351,JHN,14,KJV,he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father,and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue and behold there was a man which had his hand withered,1,JHN.14
3352,JHN,14,KJV,believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me,they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons,1,JHN.14
3353,JHN,14,KJV,the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works,for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me,1,JHN.14
3354,JHN,14,KJV,believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake,yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand,1,JHN.14
3355,JHN,14,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father,and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me ,1,JHN.14
3356,JHN,14,KJV,and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son,therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode,1,JHN.14
3357,JHN,14,KJV,if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it if ye love me keep my commandments,i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you ,1,JHN.14
3358,JHN,14,KJV,and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you,have i not seen jesus christ our lord,1,JHN.14
3359,JHN,14,KJV,i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you,blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him,1,JHN.14
3360,JHN,14,KJV,yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also,and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth,1,JHN.14
3361,JHN,14,KJV,at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you,and they laid their hands on him and took him,1,JHN.14
3362,JHN,14,KJV,he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him,and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch,1,JHN.14
3363,JHN,14,KJV,judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world,and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out,1,JHN.14
3364,JHN,14,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him,then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him,1,JHN.14
3365,JHN,14,KJV,he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me,and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee,1,JHN.14
3366,JHN,14,KJV,these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you,for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack,1,JHN.14
3367,JHN,14,KJV,but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you,and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him,1,JHN.14
3368,JHN,14,KJV,peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you,all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out,1,JHN.14
3369,JHN,14,KJV,let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid,now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings,1,JHN.14
3370,JHN,14,KJV,ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you,if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body,1,JHN.14
3371,JHN,14,KJV,if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i,or why talkest thou with her,1,JHN.14
3372,JHN,14,KJV,and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe,thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother,1,JHN.14
3373,JHN,14,KJV,hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me,i say then have they stumbled that they should fall,1,JHN.14
3374,JHN,14,KJV,but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do,and simon peter stood and warmed himself,1,JHN.14
3436,JHN,17,KJV,these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him,many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver,1,JHN.17
3437,JHN,17,KJV,and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent,but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men,1,JHN.17
3438,JHN,17,KJV,i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do,for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought,1,JHN.17
3439,JHN,17,KJV,and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was,peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you,1,JHN.17
3440,JHN,17,KJV,i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word,at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,1,JHN.17
3441,JHN,17,KJV,now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee,and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid,1,JHN.17
3442,JHN,17,KJV,for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me,consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things,1,JHN.17
3443,JHN,17,KJV,i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine,if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also,1,JHN.17
3444,JHN,17,KJV,and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them,beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy,1,JHN.17
3445,JHN,17,KJV,and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee,wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood,1,JHN.17
3446,JHN,17,KJV,holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled,brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample,1,JHN.17
3447,JHN,17,KJV,and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves,do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world,1,JHN.17
3448,JHN,17,KJV,i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world,when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst,1,JHN.17
3449,JHN,17,KJV,i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil,when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left,1,JHN.17
3450,JHN,17,KJV,they are not of the world even as i am not of the world,thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness,1,JHN.17
3451,JHN,17,KJV,sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth,and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind,1,JHN.17
3452,JHN,17,KJV,as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world,and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole,1,JHN.17
3453,JHN,17,KJV,and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth,but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things,1,JHN.17
3454,JHN,17,KJV,neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me,and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself,1,JHN.17
3455,JHN,17,KJV,and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me,he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him,1,JHN.17
3456,JHN,17,KJV,father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world,and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected,1,JHN.17
3457,JHN,17,KJV,o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me,and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh,1,JHN.17
3458,JHN,17,KJV,and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them,paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord,1,JHN.17
3459,JHN,18,KJV,when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciples,and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him,1,JHN.18
3460,JHN,18,KJV,and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples,them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear,1,JHN.18
3461,JHN,18,KJV,judas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons,therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat,1,JHN.18
3462,JHN,18,KJV,jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye,for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself,1,JHN.18
3463,JHN,18,KJV,they answered him jesus of nazareth,then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already,1,JHN.18
3464,JHN,18,KJV,jesus saith unto them i am he and judas also which betrayed him stood with them,again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus,1,JHN.18
3465,JHN,18,KJV,as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground,and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee,1,JHN.18
3466,JHN,18,KJV,then asked he them again whom seek ye,then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom,1,JHN.18
3467,JHN,18,KJV,and they said jesus of nazareth,but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,1,JHN.18
3468,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their way that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost none,and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end,1,JHN.18
3469,JHN,18,KJV,then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priests servant and cut off his right ear,and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy,1,JHN.18
3470,JHN,18,KJV,then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it,jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught,1,JHN.18
3471,JHN,18,KJV,then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year,but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you,1,JHN.18
3472,JHN,18,KJV,now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people,for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ,1,JHN.18
3473,JHN,18,KJV,and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest,now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches,1,JHN.18
3474,JHN,18,KJV,but peter stood at the door without,i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him,1,JHN.18
3475,JHN,18,KJV,then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter,for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work,1,JHN.18
3476,JHN,18,KJV,then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also one of this mans disciples,and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was numbered with the transgressors,1,JHN.18
3477,JHN,18,KJV,and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself,and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them,1,JHN.18
3478,JHN,18,KJV,the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine,i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service,1,JHN.18
3479,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing,it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out,1,JHN.18
3480,JHN,18,KJV,ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said,she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master,1,JHN.18
3481,JHN,18,KJV,and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so,but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet,1,JHN.18
3482,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me,and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph,1,JHN.18
3483,JHN,18,KJV,now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest,wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls,1,JHN.18
3484,JHN,18,KJV,and simon peter stood and warmed himself,for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing,1,JHN.18
3485,JHN,18,KJV,they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples,whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me,1,JHN.18
3486,JHN,18,KJV,he denied it and said i am not,and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh,1,JHN.18
3487,JHN,18,KJV,one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him,and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away,1,JHN.18
3488,JHN,18,KJV,peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew,thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness,1,JHN.18
3489,JHN,18,KJV,then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover,and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth,1,JHN.18
3490,JHN,18,KJV,pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man,for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved,1,JHN.18
3491,JHN,18,KJV,they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee,for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake,1,JHN.18
3492,JHN,18,KJV,then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law,i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,1,JHN.18
3493,JHN,18,KJV,the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die,and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus feet and he healed them insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of israel,1,JHN.18
3494,JHN,18,KJV,then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews,but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness,1,JHN.18
3495,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me,but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe,1,JHN.18
3496,JHN,18,KJV,pilate answered am i a jew,even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things,1,JHN.18
3497,JHN,18,KJV,thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done,and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever,1,JHN.18
3498,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence,and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified,1,JHN.18
3499,JHN,18,KJV,pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then,and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god,1,JHN.18
3500,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king,for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will,1,JHN.18
3501,JHN,18,KJV,to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth,which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual,1,JHN.18
3502,JHN,18,KJV,every one that is of the truth heareth my voice,and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations,1,JHN.18
3503,JHN,18,KJV,pilate saith unto him what is truth,now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him,1,JHN.18
3504,JHN,18,KJV,and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all ,but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man,1,JHN.18
3505,JHN,18,KJV,but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews,they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou,1,JHN.18
3506,JHN,18,KJV,then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas,then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand,1,JHN.18
3507,JHN,19,KJV,then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him ,and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets,1,JHN.19
3508,JHN,19,KJV,and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe and said hail king of the jews and they smote him with their hands,and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter,1,JHN.19
3509,JHN,19,KJV,pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him,and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them,1,JHN.19
3510,JHN,19,KJV,then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe,for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself,1,JHN.19
3511,JHN,19,KJV,and pilate saith unto them behold the man when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him ,and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake,1,JHN.19
3512,JHN,19,KJV,pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him,for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself,1,JHN.19
3513,JHN,19,KJV,the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him,1,JHN.19
3514,JHN,19,KJV,when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou,but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus,1,JHN.19
3515,JHN,19,KJV,but jesus gave him no answer,i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses,1,JHN.19
3516,JHN,19,KJV,then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me,repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,1,JHN.19
3517,JHN,19,KJV,knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee,for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them,1,JHN.19
3518,JHN,19,KJV,jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin,when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee,1,JHN.19
3519,JHN,19,KJV,and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar,but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming,1,JHN.19
3520,JHN,19,KJV,when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha,i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied,1,JHN.19
3521,JHN,19,KJV,and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him,then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished,1,JHN.19
3522,JHN,19,KJV,pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king,the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god,1,JHN.19
3523,JHN,19,KJV,the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar,by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith,1,JHN.19
3524,JHN,19,KJV,then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified,a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory,1,JHN.19
3525,JHN,19,KJV,and they took jesus and led him away,but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny,1,JHN.19
3526,JHN,19,KJV,and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst,likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save,1,JHN.19
3527,JHN,19,KJV,and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross,or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel,1,JHN.19
3528,JHN,19,KJV,and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews,then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come,1,JHN.19
3529,JHN,19,KJV,this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin,for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed,1,JHN.19
3530,JHN,19,KJV,then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews,and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,1,JHN.19
3531,JHN,19,KJV,pilate answered what i have written i have written,speak not evil one of another brethren,1,JHN.19
3532,JHN,19,KJV,then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout,and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost,1,JHN.19
3533,JHN,19,KJV,they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots,tell me therefore which of them will love him most,1,JHN.19
3534,JHN,19,KJV,these things therefore the soldiers did,and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant,1,JHN.19
3535,JHN,19,KJV,now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene,and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched,1,JHN.19
3536,JHN,19,KJV,when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst,and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother,1,JHN.19
3537,JHN,19,KJV,now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth,and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented,1,JHN.19
3538,JHN,19,KJV,when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost,for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god,1,JHN.19
3539,JHN,19,KJV,the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away,but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john,1,JHN.19
3540,JHN,19,KJV,then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him,and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us,1,JHN.19
3541,JHN,19,KJV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water,and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot,1,JHN.19
3542,JHN,19,KJV,and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe,then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord,1,JHN.19
3543,JHN,19,KJV,for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken,i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase,1,JHN.19
3544,JHN,19,KJV,and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced,others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil,1,JHN.19
3545,JHN,19,KJV,and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave,and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented,1,JHN.19
3546,JHN,19,KJV,he came therefore and took the body of jesus,wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ,1,JHN.19
3547,JHN,19,KJV,and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight ,therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat,1,JHN.19
3548,JHN,19,KJV,then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury,and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings,1,JHN.19
3549,JHN,19,KJV,now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid,jesus answered them do ye now believe,1,JHN.19
3550,JHN,19,KJV,there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand,jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life,1,JHN.19
3582,JHN,21,KJV,after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself ,and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh,1,JHN.21
3583,JHN,21,KJV,there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples,and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also,1,JHN.21
3584,JHN,21,KJV,simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing,for with god nothing shall be impossible,1,JHN.21
3585,JHN,21,KJV,they say unto him we also go with thee,then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents,1,JHN.21
3586,JHN,21,KJV,they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing,do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world,1,JHN.21
3587,JHN,21,KJV,but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus,but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god,1,JHN.21
3588,JHN,21,KJV,then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat,and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection,1,JHN.21
3589,JHN,21,KJV,they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find,therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god,1,JHN.21
3590,JHN,21,KJV,they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes,and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many,1,JHN.21
3591,JHN,21,KJV,therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord,and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus,1,JHN.21
3592,JHN,21,KJV,now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea,but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness,1,JHN.21
3593,JHN,21,KJV,and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes,then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman,1,JHN.21
3594,JHN,21,KJV,as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread,and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners,1,JHN.21
3595,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught,while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further,1,JHN.21
3596,JHN,21,KJV,simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken,now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem,1,JHN.21
3597,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them come and dine,and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it,1,JHN.21
3598,JHN,21,KJV,and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou,if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father,1,JHN.21
3599,JHN,21,KJV,knowing that it was the lord,likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience,1,JHN.21
3600,JHN,21,KJV,jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise,and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent,1,JHN.21
3601,JHN,21,KJV,this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead,the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering,1,JHN.21
3602,JHN,21,KJV,so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these,for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it,1,JHN.21
3603,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them,1,JHN.21
3604,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him feed my lambs,he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge,1,JHN.21
3605,JHN,21,KJV,he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not,1,JHN.21
3606,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,1,JHN.21
3607,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him feed my sheep,who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges,1,JHN.21
3608,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ,1,JHN.21
3609,JHN,21,KJV,peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me,then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready,1,JHN.21
3610,JHN,21,KJV,and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee,and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing,1,JHN.21
3611,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto him feed my sheep,but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was,1,JHN.21
3612,JHN,21,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not,and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be,1,JHN.21
3613,JHN,21,KJV,this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god,they all say unto him let him be crucified,1,JHN.21
3614,JHN,21,KJV,and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me,who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord,1,JHN.21
3615,JHN,21,KJV,then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee,but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god,1,JHN.21
3616,JHN,21,KJV,peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do ,but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man,1,JHN.21
3617,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory,1,JHN.21
3618,JHN,21,KJV,then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee,and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto him,1,JHN.21
3619,JHN,21,KJV,this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true,and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only,1,JHN.21
3620,JHN,21,KJV,and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written,are we better than they ,1,JHN.21
3695,ACT,4,KJV,and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead,for then would they not have ceased to be offered,1,ACT.4
3696,ACT,4,KJV,and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide,and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing,1,ACT.4
3697,ACT,4,KJV,howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand,who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season,1,ACT.4
3698,ACT,4,KJV,and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem,for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me,1,ACT.4
3699,ACT,4,KJV,and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this,for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath,1,ACT.4
3700,ACT,4,KJV,then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole,wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father,1,ACT.4
3701,ACT,4,KJV,this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner,and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come,1,ACT.4
3702,ACT,4,KJV,neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master thus saying thou reproachest us also,1,ACT.4
3703,ACT,4,KJV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus,the lord be with you all,1,ACT.4
3704,ACT,4,KJV,and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it,and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him,1,ACT.4
3705,ACT,4,KJV,but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men,wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient yet for loves sake i rather beseech thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ,1,ACT.4
3706,ACT,4,KJV,for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it ,lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins keep thyself pure,1,ACT.4
3707,ACT,4,KJV,but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name,nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his,1,ACT.4
3708,ACT,4,KJV,and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus,yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world,1,ACT.4
3709,ACT,4,KJV,but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye,for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god,1,ACT.4
3710,ACT,4,KJV,for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard,now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do ,1,ACT.4
3711,ACT,4,KJV,so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done,and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed,1,ACT.4
3712,ACT,4,KJV,for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed,and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked,1,ACT.4
3713,ACT,4,KJV,and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them,and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago,1,ACT.4
3714,ACT,4,KJV,and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things,for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he,1,ACT.4
3715,ACT,4,KJV,the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ,have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another,1,ACT.4
3716,ACT,4,KJV,for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done,peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now,1,ACT.4
3717,ACT,4,KJV,and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus,therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment,1,ACT.4
3718,ACT,4,KJV,and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness,and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go,1,ACT.4
3719,ACT,4,KJV,and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common,for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take,1,ACT.4
3720,ACT,4,KJV,and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all,blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled,1,ACT.4
3721,ACT,4,KJV,neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need,then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee,1,ACT.4
3722,ACT,4,KJV,and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet,by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones,1,ACT.4
3775,ACT,7,KJV,then said the high priest are these things so,then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not,1,ACT.7
3776,ACT,7,KJV,and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee,and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon,1,ACT.7
3777,ACT,7,KJV,then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell,i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star,1,ACT.7
3778,ACT,7,KJV,and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child,but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering,1,ACT.7
3779,ACT,7,KJV,and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years,your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead,1,ACT.7
3780,ACT,7,KJV,and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place,and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things,1,ACT.7
3781,ACT,7,KJV,and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs,and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle,1,ACT.7
3782,ACT,7,KJV,and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house,but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts,1,ACT.7
3783,ACT,7,KJV,now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance,and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born,1,ACT.7
3784,ACT,7,KJV,but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out our fathers first,and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land,1,ACT.7
3785,ACT,7,KJV,and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh,and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest,1,ACT.7
3786,ACT,7,KJV,then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls,what is it which these witness against thee,1,ACT.7
3787,ACT,7,KJV,so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem,and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not,1,ACT.7
3788,ACT,7,KJV,but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt till another king arose which knew not joseph,therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth,1,ACT.7
3789,ACT,7,KJV,the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live,and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done,1,ACT.7
3790,ACT,7,KJV,in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his fathers house three months and when he was cast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son,but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness,1,ACT.7
3791,ACT,7,KJV,and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds,and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst,1,ACT.7
3792,ACT,7,KJV,and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel,then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days,1,ACT.7
3793,ACT,7,KJV,and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not,and here is the mind which hath wisdom,1,ACT.7
3794,ACT,7,KJV,and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another,and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him,1,ACT.7
3795,ACT,7,KJV,but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us,then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready,1,ACT.7
3796,ACT,7,KJV,wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday,now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them,1,ACT.7
3797,ACT,7,KJV,then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons,which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual,1,ACT.7
3798,ACT,7,KJV,and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush,for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ,1,ACT.7
3799,ACT,7,KJV,when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him saying i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob,and here is the mind which hath wisdom,1,ACT.7
3800,ACT,7,KJV,then moses trembled and durst not behold,for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ,1,ACT.7
3801,ACT,7,KJV,then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground,it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it,1,ACT.7
3802,ACT,7,KJV,i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them,even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation,1,ACT.7
3803,ACT,7,KJV,and now come i will send thee into egypt,set your affection on things above not on things on the earth,1,ACT.7
3804,ACT,7,KJV,this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge,then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost,1,ACT.7
3805,ACT,7,KJV,the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush,and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers,1,ACT.7
3806,ACT,7,KJV,he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years,and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept,1,ACT.7
3807,ACT,7,KJV,this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear,and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre,1,ACT.7
3808,ACT,7,KJV,this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him,and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber,1,ACT.7
3809,ACT,7,KJV,and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands,and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee,1,ACT.7
3810,ACT,7,KJV,then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness,for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world,1,ACT.7
3811,ACT,7,KJV,yea ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon,and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread,1,ACT.7
3812,ACT,7,KJV,our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen,the second epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi a city of macedonia by titus and lucas,1,ACT.7
3813,ACT,7,KJV,which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob,by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths,1,ACT.7
3814,ACT,7,KJV,but solomon built him an house,and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you,1,ACT.7
3815,ACT,7,KJV,howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me,and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that it be made bread,1,ACT.7
3816,ACT,7,KJV,saith the lord or what is the place of my rest,last of all the woman died also,1,ACT.7
3817,ACT,7,KJV,hath not my hand made all these things,and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom,1,ACT.7
3818,ACT,7,KJV,ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye,in him was life and the life was the light of men,1,ACT.7
3819,ACT,7,KJV,which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted,nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you,1,ACT.7
3820,ACT,7,KJV,and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth,but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision,1,ACT.7
3821,ACT,7,KJV,but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god,no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier,1,ACT.7
3822,ACT,7,KJV,then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was saul,and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet,1,ACT.7
3823,ACT,7,KJV,and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit,and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people,1,ACT.7
3824,ACT,7,KJV,and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge,and he went in to tarry with them,1,ACT.7
3825,ACT,7,KJV,and when he had said this he fell asleep,the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil,1,ACT.7
3974,ACT,12,KJV,now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church,and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived,1,ACT.12
3975,ACT,12,KJV,and he killed james the brother of john with the sword,for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ,1,ACT.12
3976,ACT,12,KJV,and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also,see that ye refuse not him that speaketh,1,ACT.12
3977,ACT,12,KJV,then were the days of unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people,but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles,1,ACT.12
3978,ACT,12,KJV,peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him,then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again,1,ACT.12
3979,ACT,12,KJV,and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison,again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth,1,ACT.12
3980,ACT,12,KJV,and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly,and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common,1,ACT.12
3981,ACT,12,KJV,and his chains fell off from his hands,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness,1,ACT.12
3982,ACT,12,KJV,and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals,and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away,1,ACT.12
3983,ACT,12,KJV,and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me,for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you,1,ACT.12
3984,ACT,12,KJV,and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision,and he said unto them why are ye troubled,1,ACT.12
3985,ACT,12,KJV,when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him,and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward,1,ACT.12
3986,ACT,12,KJV,and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews,and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda,1,ACT.12
3987,ACT,12,KJV,and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying,and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful,1,ACT.12
3988,ACT,12,KJV,and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda,and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever,1,ACT.12
3989,ACT,12,KJV,and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate,wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god,1,ACT.12
3990,ACT,12,KJV,and they said unto her thou art mad,and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down,1,ACT.12
3991,ACT,12,KJV,but she constantly affirmed that it was even so,and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say,1,ACT.12
3992,ACT,12,KJV,then said they it is his angel,and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour,1,ACT.12
3993,ACT,12,KJV,but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished,jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence,1,ACT.12
3994,ACT,12,KJV,but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison,for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you,1,ACT.12
3995,ACT,12,KJV,and he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren,wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption,1,ACT.12
3996,ACT,12,KJV,and he departed and went into another place,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him,1,ACT.12
3997,ACT,12,KJV,now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter,heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away,1,ACT.12
3998,ACT,12,KJV,and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death,and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters ,1,ACT.12
3999,ACT,12,KJV,and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode,beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you,1,ACT.12

4001,ACT,12,KJV,and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them,again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king,1,ACT.12
4002,ACT,12,KJV,and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man,and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth,1,ACT.12

4107,ACT,16,KJV,and they passing by mysia came down to troas,if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron,1,ACT.16

4121,ACT,16,KJV,and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed,is not this the carpenters son,1,ACT.16
4122,ACT,16,KJV,and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled,but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitanes which i also hate,1,ACT.16
4123,ACT,16,KJV,but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here,for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do,1,ACT.16
4124,ACT,16,KJV,then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved,and the morrow after they entered into caesarea,1,ACT.16
4125,ACT,16,KJV,and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house,this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh,1,ACT.16
4126,ACT,16,KJV,and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house,then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned,1,ACT.16
4127,ACT,16,KJV,and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway,and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship,1,ACT.16
4128,ACT,16,KJV,and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house,and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols,1,ACT.16
4129,ACT,16,KJV,and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go,for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption,1,ACT.16
4130,ACT,16,KJV,and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace,but many that are first shall be last and the last first,1,ACT.16
4131,ACT,16,KJV,but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily,know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,1,ACT.16
4132,ACT,16,KJV,nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out,but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men,1,ACT.16
4133,ACT,16,KJV,and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans,and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem,1,ACT.16
4134,ACT,16,KJV,and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city,to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ,1,ACT.16
4135,ACT,16,KJV,and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed,so run that ye may obtain,1,ACT.16
4406,ACT,26,KJV,then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself,and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david,1,ACT.26
4407,ACT,26,KJV,then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently,give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved,1,ACT.26
4408,ACT,26,KJV,my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee,and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men,1,ACT.26
4409,ACT,26,KJV,and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come,but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness,1,ACT.26
4410,ACT,26,KJV,for which hopes sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews,now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them,1,ACT.26
4411,ACT,26,KJV,why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead,and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul,1,ACT.26
4412,ACT,26,KJV,i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth,mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them,1,ACT.26
4413,ACT,26,KJV,which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them ,and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned,1,ACT.26
4414,ACT,26,KJV,and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities,but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye,1,ACT.26
4415,ACT,26,KJV,whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me,i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now,1,ACT.26
4416,ACT,26,KJV,and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me,howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee,1,ACT.26
4417,ACT,26,KJV,it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks,for neither did his brethren believe in him,1,ACT.26
4418,ACT,26,KJV,and i said who art thou lord,but there are some of you that believe not,1,ACT.26
4419,ACT,26,KJV,and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest,but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons,1,ACT.26
4420,ACT,26,KJV,but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me,how much then is a man better than a sheep,1,ACT.26
4421,ACT,26,KJV,whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance,and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead,1,ACT.26
4422,ACT,26,KJV,for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me ,and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him,1,ACT.26
4423,ACT,26,KJV,having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles,and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers,1,ACT.26
4424,ACT,26,KJV,and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad,or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance,1,ACT.26
4425,ACT,26,KJV,but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness,and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ,1,ACT.26
4426,ACT,26,KJV,for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner,and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire,1,ACT.26
4427,ACT,26,KJV,king agrippa believest thou the prophets,and what shall i more say,1,ACT.26
4428,ACT,26,KJV,then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian,then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready,1,ACT.26
4429,ACT,26,KJV,and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds,for many are called but few are chosen,1,ACT.26
4430,ACT,26,KJV,and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds,first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world,1,ACT.26
4431,ACT,26,KJV,then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar,yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all,1,ACT.26
4511,ROM,2,KJV,therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things,god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged,1,ROM.2
4512,ROM,2,KJV,but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things,for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me,1,ROM.2
4513,ROM,2,KJV,and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god,heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away,1,ROM.2
4514,ROM,2,KJV,or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance,and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,1,ROM.2
4515,ROM,2,KJV,but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile for there is no respect of persons with god,by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god,1,ROM.2
4516,ROM,2,KJV,for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified,and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth,1,ROM.2
4517,ROM,2,KJV,for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel,watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come,1,ROM.2
4518,ROM,2,KJV,behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god and knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law,then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience,1,ROM.2
4519,ROM,2,KJV,thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself,and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,1,ROM.2
4520,ROM,2,KJV,thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal,and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight,1,ROM.2
4521,ROM,2,KJV,thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery,let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe,1,ROM.2
4522,ROM,2,KJV,thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege,and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name,1,ROM.2
4523,ROM,2,KJV,thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou god,but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning,1,ROM.2
4524,ROM,2,KJV,for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written,and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great,1,ROM.2
4525,ROM,2,KJV,for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision,and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid,1,ROM.2
4526,ROM,2,KJV,therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision,for what have i to do to judge them also that are without,1,ROM.2
4527,ROM,2,KJV,and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law,for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away,1,ROM.2
4528,ROM,2,KJV,for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god,jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also,1,ROM.2
4728,ROM,11,KJV,i say then hath god cast away his people,likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear,1,ROM.11
4729,ROM,11,KJV,for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin,and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed,1,ROM.11
4730,ROM,11,KJV,god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew,let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn,1,ROM.11
4731,ROM,11,KJV,wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias,and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee,1,ROM.11
4732,ROM,11,KJV,how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life,but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day,1,ROM.11
4733,ROM,11,KJV,but what saith the answer of god unto him,why are they then baptized for the dead,1,ROM.11
4734,ROM,11,KJV,i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high,1,ROM.11
4735,ROM,11,KJV,even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace,and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him,1,ROM.11
4736,ROM,11,KJV,and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace,if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you,1,ROM.11
4737,ROM,11,KJV,but if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work,thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way,1,ROM.11
4738,ROM,11,KJV,israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day,for his life is taken from the earth,1,ROM.11
4739,ROM,11,KJV,and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway,and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down,1,ROM.11
4740,ROM,11,KJV,i say then have they stumbled that they should fall,let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ,1,ROM.11
4741,ROM,11,KJV,god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy,ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts,1,ROM.11
4742,ROM,11,KJV,now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness,saith the lord or what is the place of my rest,1,ROM.11
4743,ROM,11,KJV,for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them,and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence,1,ROM.11
4744,ROM,11,KJV,for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead,and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb,1,ROM.11
4745,ROM,11,KJV,for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches,then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from jerusalem,1,ROM.11
4746,ROM,11,KJV,and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branches,and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am,1,ROM.11
4747,ROM,11,KJV,but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee,and many women were there beholding afar off which followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him among which was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees children,1,ROM.11
4748,ROM,11,KJV,thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in,yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants,1,ROM.11
4749,ROM,11,KJV,well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith,have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him,1,ROM.11
4750,ROM,11,KJV,be not highminded but fear for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee,and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever,1,ROM.11
4751,ROM,11,KJV,behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off,god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring,1,ROM.11
4752,ROM,11,KJV,and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again,but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned,1,ROM.11
4753,ROM,11,KJV,for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree,greet all the brethren with an holy kiss,1,ROM.11
4754,ROM,11,KJV,for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in,but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man,1,ROM.11
4755,ROM,11,KJV,and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins,but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we,1,ROM.11
4756,ROM,11,KJV,as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes,and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask,1,ROM.11
4757,ROM,11,KJV,for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance,but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him,1,ROM.11
4758,ROM,11,KJV,for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy,and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence,1,ROM.11
4759,ROM,11,KJV,for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all,for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame,1,ROM.11
4760,ROM,11,KJV,o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord,and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them,1,ROM.11
4761,ROM,11,KJV,or who hath been his counsellor,but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid,1,ROM.11
4762,ROM,11,KJV,or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again,and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith,1,ROM.11
4763,ROM,11,KJV,for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever,even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation,1,ROM.11
4799,ROM,14,KJV,him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations,and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut,1,ROM.14
4800,ROM,14,KJV,for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs,and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging,1,ROM.14
4801,ROM,14,KJV,let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him,if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father,1,ROM.14
4802,ROM,14,KJV,who art thou that judgest another mans servant,and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,1,ROM.14
4803,ROM,14,KJV,to his own master he standeth or falleth,if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you,1,ROM.14
4804,ROM,14,KJV,yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand,for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end as also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus,1,ROM.14
4805,ROM,14,KJV,one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike ,and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world,1,ROM.14
4806,ROM,14,KJV,let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind,and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads,1,ROM.14
4807,ROM,14,KJV,he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it ,shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect,1,ROM.14
4808,ROM,14,KJV,he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks,and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women,1,ROM.14
4809,ROM,14,KJV,for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself,having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son,1,ROM.14
4810,ROM,14,KJV,for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords,and the lord turned and looked upon peter,1,ROM.14
4811,ROM,14,KJV,for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living,and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands,1,ROM.14
4812,ROM,14,KJV,but why dost thou judge thy brother,see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men ,1,ROM.14
4813,ROM,14,KJV,or why dost thou set at nought thy brother,and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs,1,ROM.14
4814,ROM,14,KJV,for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ,martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day,1,ROM.14
4815,ROM,14,KJV,for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god,and immediately the leprosy departed from him,1,ROM.14
4816,ROM,14,KJV,so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god,and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain,1,ROM.14
4817,ROM,14,KJV,let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brothers way,and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i have nothing to set before him,1,ROM.14
4818,ROM,14,KJV,i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean,therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat,1,ROM.14
4819,ROM,14,KJV,but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably,if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine,1,ROM.14

4821,ROM,14,KJV,let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost,know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness,1,ROM.14
4822,ROM,14,KJV,for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men,for she hath wrought a good work upon me,1,ROM.14
4823,ROM,14,KJV,let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another,this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come,1,ROM.14
4824,ROM,14,KJV,for meat destroy not the work of god,and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men,1,ROM.14
4825,ROM,14,KJV,all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence,for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath,1,ROM.14
4826,ROM,14,KJV,it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,1,ROM.14
4827,ROM,14,KJV,have it to thyself before god,then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground,1,ROM.14
4828,ROM,14,KJV,happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth,because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth,1,ROM.14
4829,ROM,14,KJV,and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin,the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all,1,ROM.14
4943,1CO,4,KJV,let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god,behold i come as a thief,1,1CO.4
4944,1CO,4,KJV,moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful,honour widows that are widows indeed,1,1CO.4
4945,1CO,4,KJV,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self,wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth,1,1CO.4
4946,1CO,4,KJV,for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord,and ye are witnesses of these things,1,1CO.4
4947,1CO,4,KJV,therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god,the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican,1,1CO.4
4948,1CO,4,KJV,and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another,now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake,1,1CO.4
4949,1CO,4,KJV,for who maketh thee to differ from another ,now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you,1,1CO.4
4950,1CO,4,KJV,and what hast thou that thou didst not receive,then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked,1,1CO.4
4951,1CO,4,KJV,now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it ,and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live,1,1CO.4
4952,1CO,4,KJV,now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you,for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men,1,1CO.4
4953,1CO,4,KJV,for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men,and he began to speak unto them by parables,1,1CO.4
4954,1CO,4,KJV,we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised,repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,1,1CO.4
4955,1CO,4,KJV,even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day,by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace,1,1CO.4
4956,1CO,4,KJV,i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you ,and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head,1,1CO.4
4957,1CO,4,KJV,for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel,but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled,1,1CO.4
4958,1CO,4,KJV,wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me,and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am,1,1CO.4
4959,1CO,4,KJV,for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church,wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth,1,1CO.4
4960,1CO,4,KJV,now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you,seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also,1,1CO.4
4961,1CO,4,KJV,but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power,neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer,1,1CO.4
4962,1CO,4,KJV,for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power,and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell,1,1CO.4
4963,1CO,4,KJV,shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness,but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me,1,1CO.4
4976,1CO,6,KJV,dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints,to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ,1,1CO.6
4977,1CO,6,KJV,do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world,and i fell at his feet to worship him,1,1CO.6
4978,1CO,6,KJV,and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters,now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ,1,1CO.6
4979,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that we shall judge angels,but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden,1,1CO.6
4980,1CO,6,KJV,how much more things that pertain to this life,then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself,1,1CO.6
4981,1CO,6,KJV,if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church,then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar,1,1CO.6
4982,1CO,6,KJV,is it so that there is not a wise man among you,timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen salute you,1,1CO.6
4983,1CO,6,KJV,no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren,then the steward said within himself what shall i do,1,1CO.6
4984,1CO,6,KJV,but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers,and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever,1,1CO.6
4985,1CO,6,KJV,now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another,wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire,1,1CO.6
4986,1CO,6,KJV,why do ye not rather take wrong,and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other,1,1CO.6
4987,1CO,6,KJV,why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded,and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared,1,1CO.6
4988,1CO,6,KJV,nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren,and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus,1,1CO.6
4989,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god,and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god,1,1CO.6
4990,1CO,6,KJV,be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god,that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ,1,1CO.6
4991,1CO,6,KJV,and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god,for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,1,1CO.6
4992,1CO,6,KJV,all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any,and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness,1,1CO.6
4993,1CO,6,KJV,meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them,for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband,1,1CO.6
4994,1CO,6,KJV,now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body,and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things,1,1CO.6
4995,1CO,6,KJV,and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power,and the lord said unto him now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness,1,1CO.6
4996,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ,for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses,1,1CO.6
4997,1CO,6,KJV,shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot,can a devil open the eyes of the blind,1,1CO.6
4998,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body,and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father,1,1CO.6
4999,1CO,6,KJV,for two saith he shall be one flesh,and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us,1,1CO.6
5000,1CO,6,KJV,but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit,and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called,1,1CO.6
5001,1CO,6,KJV,every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body,nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love,1,1CO.6
5002,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own,but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people,1,1CO.6
5003,1CO,6,KJV,for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods,we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you a faithful minister of christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit,1,1CO.6
5049,1CO,8,KJV,now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge,in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ,1,1CO.8
5050,1CO,8,KJV,knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth,but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him,1,1CO.8
5051,1CO,8,KJV,and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled,1,1CO.8
5052,1CO,8,KJV,but if any man love god the same is known of him,and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed,1,1CO.8
5053,1CO,8,KJV,as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one,for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints,1,1CO.8
5054,1CO,8,KJV,for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him,above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo i come to do thy will o god,1,1CO.8
5055,1CO,8,KJV,howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled,then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them,1,1CO.8
5056,1CO,8,KJV,but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse,then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm,1,1CO.8
5057,1CO,8,KJV,but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak,and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre,1,1CO.8
5058,1CO,8,KJV,for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died,and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,1,1CO.8
5059,1CO,8,KJV,but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ,wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him,1,1CO.8
5060,1CO,8,KJV,wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend,and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him,1,1CO.8
5061,1CO,9,KJV,have i not seen jesus christ our lord,by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith,1,1CO.9
5062,1CO,9,KJV,are not ye my work in the lord,and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds,1,1CO.9
5063,1CO,9,KJV,if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord,wilt thou then not be afraid of the power,1,1CO.9
5064,1CO,9,KJV,mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink,for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth,1,1CO.9
5065,1CO,9,KJV,have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas,wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble,1,1CO.9
5066,1CO,9,KJV,or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working,and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion,1,1CO.9
5067,1CO,9,KJV,who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges,and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance,1,1CO.9
5068,1CO,9,KJV,who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof,therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock,1,1CO.9
5069,1CO,9,KJV,or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock,for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places,1,1CO.9
5070,1CO,9,KJV,say i these things as a man,and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat,1,1CO.9
5071,1CO,9,KJV,or saith not the law the same also,now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only,1,1CO.9
5072,1CO,9,KJV,for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal,1,1CO.9
5073,1CO,9,KJV,doth god take care for oxen,and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem,1,1CO.9
5074,1CO,9,KJV,or saith he it altogether for our sakes,and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately tell us when shall these things be,1,1CO.9
5075,1CO,9,KJV,for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope,and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek after a sign,1,1CO.9
5076,1CO,9,KJV,if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things,and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions,1,1CO.9
5077,1CO,9,KJV,if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather,take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is,1,1CO.9
5078,1CO,9,KJV,nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ,but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers,1,1CO.9
5079,1CO,9,KJV,do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple,now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god,1,1CO.9
5080,1CO,9,KJV,and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar,then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise,1,1CO.9
5081,1CO,9,KJV,even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel,and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,1,1CO.9
5082,1CO,9,KJV,but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void,for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,1,1CO.9
5083,1CO,9,KJV,for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me,and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you,1,1CO.9
5084,1CO,9,KJV,verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel,and there was a division among them,1,1CO.9
5085,1CO,9,KJV,for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more,barabbas or jesus which is called christ,1,1CO.9
5086,1CO,9,KJV,and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law,and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father,1,1CO.9
5087,1CO,9,KJV,to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some,and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel,1,1CO.9
5088,1CO,9,KJV,and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize,and he was casting out a devil and it was dumb,1,1CO.9
5089,1CO,9,KJV,so run that ye may obtain,but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god,1,1CO.9
5090,1CO,9,KJV,and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things,who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul,1,1CO.9
5091,1CO,9,KJV,now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible,for sinners also do even the same,1,1CO.9
5092,1CO,9,KJV,i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway,for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things,1,1CO.9
5182,1CO,13,KJV,though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal,and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was numbered with the transgressors,1,1CO.13
5183,1CO,13,KJV,and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing,unto the galatians written from rome,1,1CO.13
5184,1CO,13,KJV,and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved,1,1CO.13
5185,1CO,13,KJV,charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things,for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me,1,1CO.13
5186,1CO,13,KJV,charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god,1,1CO.13
5187,1CO,13,KJV,for we know in part and we prophesy in part,and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new,1,1CO.13
5188,1CO,13,KJV,but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away,and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out,1,1CO.13
5189,1CO,13,KJV,when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things,wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men,1,1CO.13
5190,1CO,13,KJV,for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known,there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry,1,1CO.13
5191,1CO,13,KJV,and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity,the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged,1,1CO.13
5233,1CO,15,KJV,moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain,for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel,1,1CO.15
5234,1CO,15,KJV,for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep,i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns,1,1CO.15
5235,1CO,15,KJV,after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles,ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts,1,1CO.15
5236,1CO,15,KJV,and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time,and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery,1,1CO.15
5237,1CO,15,KJV,for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god,but neither so did their witness agree together,1,1CO.15
5238,1CO,15,KJV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me,and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou,1,1CO.15
5239,1CO,15,KJV,therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed,god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord,1,1CO.15
5240,1CO,15,KJV,now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead,do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy,1,1CO.15
5241,1CO,15,KJV,but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain,and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not,1,1CO.15
5242,1CO,15,KJV,yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not,and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia,1,1CO.15
5243,1CO,15,KJV,for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins,i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ,1,1CO.15
5244,1CO,15,KJV,then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished,and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered,1,1CO.15
5245,1CO,15,KJV,if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable,and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed,1,1CO.15
5246,1CO,15,KJV,but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept,to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe,1,1CO.15
5247,1CO,15,KJV,for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead,verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit,1,1CO.15
5248,1CO,15,KJV,for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive,and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men,1,1CO.15
5249,1CO,15,KJV,but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming,let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief,1,1CO.15
5250,1CO,15,KJV,then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power,and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise,1,1CO.15
5251,1CO,15,KJV,for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet,he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son,1,1CO.15
5252,1CO,15,KJV,the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free,1,1CO.15
5253,1CO,15,KJV,for he hath put all things under his feet,then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me,1,1CO.15
5254,1CO,15,KJV,but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him,wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty,1,1CO.15
5255,1CO,15,KJV,and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all,i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean,1,1CO.15
5256,1CO,15,KJV,else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all,and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on,1,1CO.15
5257,1CO,15,KJV,why are they then baptized for the dead,do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia,1,1CO.15
5258,1CO,15,KJV,and why stand we in jeopardy every hour,let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god,1,1CO.15
5259,1CO,15,KJV,i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily,let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need,1,1CO.15
5260,1CO,15,KJV,if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not,and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country,1,1CO.15
5261,1CO,15,KJV,let us eat and drink for to morrow we die,and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created,1,1CO.15
5262,1CO,15,KJV,be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners,if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death,1,1CO.15
5263,1CO,15,KJV,awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame,verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you,1,1CO.15
5264,1CO,15,KJV,but some man will say how are the dead raised up,but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away,1,1CO.15
5265,1CO,15,KJV,and with what body do they come,and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul,1,1CO.15
5266,1CO,15,KJV,thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body,and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean,1,1CO.15
5267,1CO,15,KJV,all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds,they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps,1,1CO.15
5268,1CO,15,KJV,there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another,and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out,1,1CO.15
5269,1CO,15,KJV,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory,lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all,1,1CO.15
5270,1CO,15,KJV,so also is the resurrection of the dead,and he asked the scribes what question ye with them,1,1CO.15
5271,1CO,15,KJV,it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body,and he said unto them why are ye troubled,1,1CO.15
5272,1CO,15,KJV,there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body,then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye,1,1CO.15
5273,1CO,15,KJV,and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit,and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them,1,1CO.15
5274,1CO,15,KJV,howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual,even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight,1,1CO.15
5275,1CO,15,KJV,the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven,then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world,1,1CO.15
5276,1CO,15,KJV,as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly,or do i seek to please men,1,1CO.15
5277,1CO,15,KJV,and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly,but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole,1,1CO.15
5278,1CO,15,KJV,now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith,1,1CO.15
5279,1CO,15,KJV,behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed,now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby,1,1CO.15
5280,1CO,15,KJV,for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality,and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly,1,1CO.15
5281,1CO,15,KJV,so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory,for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion,1,1CO.15
5282,1CO,15,KJV,o death where is thy sting,and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read,1,1CO.15
5283,1CO,15,KJV,o grave where is thy victory,for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years,1,1CO.15
5284,1CO,15,KJV,the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law,the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,1,1CO.15
5285,1CO,15,KJV,but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ,see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men ,1,1CO.15
5286,1CO,15,KJV,therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord,erastus abode at corinth but trophimus have i left at miletum sick,1,1CO.15
5329,2CO,2,KJV,but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness,jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water,1,2CO.2
5330,2CO,2,KJV,for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me,and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish,1,2CO.2
5331,2CO,2,KJV,and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all,and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god,1,2CO.2
5332,2CO,2,KJV,for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you,and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration,1,2CO.2
5333,2CO,2,KJV,but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all,now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives,1,2CO.2
5334,2CO,2,KJV,sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many,i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,1,2CO.2
5335,2CO,2,KJV,so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow,and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head and began to salute him hail king of the jews and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him,1,2CO.2
5336,2CO,2,KJV,wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him,enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it,1,2CO.2
5337,2CO,2,KJV,for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things,jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth,1,2CO.2
5338,2CO,2,KJV,to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices,and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also,1,2CO.2
5339,2CO,2,KJV,furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia,for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry,1,2CO.2
5340,2CO,2,KJV,now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place,now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest,1,2CO.2
5341,2CO,2,KJV,for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life,be not highminded but fear for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee,1,2CO.2
5342,2CO,2,KJV,and who is sufficient for these things,for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel,1,2CO.2
5343,2CO,2,KJV,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ,now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness,1,2CO.2
5344,2CO,3,KJV,do we begin again to commend ourselves,and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized,1,2CO.3
5345,2CO,3,KJV,or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you,have ye your heart yet hardened,1,2CO.3
5346,2CO,3,KJV,ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart,and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation,1,2CO.3
5347,2CO,3,KJV,and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life,howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand,1,2CO.3
5348,2CO,3,KJV,but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious,when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost,1,2CO.3
5349,2CO,3,KJV,for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory,as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love,1,2CO.3
5350,2CO,3,KJV,for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth,therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory,1,2CO.3
5351,2CO,3,KJV,for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them,1,2CO.3
5352,2CO,3,KJV,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ,then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord,1,2CO.3
5353,2CO,3,KJV,but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart,and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece,1,2CO.3
5354,2CO,3,KJV,nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away,for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he,1,2CO.3
5355,2CO,3,KJV,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty,so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free,1,2CO.3
5356,2CO,3,KJV,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,the cloke that i left at troas with carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments,1,2CO.3
5369,2CO,5,KJV,for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens,moreover the law entered that the offence might abound,1,2CO.5
5370,2CO,5,KJV,for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked,knowing that it was the lord,1,2CO.5
5371,2CO,5,KJV,for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god,1,2CO.5
5372,2CO,5,KJV,now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it,1,2CO.5
5373,2CO,5,KJV,therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord,and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep,1,2CO.5
5374,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him,but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,1,2CO.5
5375,2CO,5,KJV,for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him,1,2CO.5
5376,2CO,5,KJV,knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences,and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell,1,2CO.5
5377,2CO,5,KJV,for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart,and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god,1,2CO.5
5378,2CO,5,KJV,for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause,wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls,1,2CO.5
5379,2CO,5,KJV,for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again,and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him,1,2CO.5
5380,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more,he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day,1,2CO.5
5381,2CO,5,KJV,therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new,and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks,1,2CO.5
5382,2CO,5,KJV,and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be,1,2CO.5
5383,2CO,5,KJV,now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god,and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean,1,2CO.5
5384,2CO,5,KJV,for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him,and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not us,1,2CO.5
5397,2CO,7,KJV,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god,salute my wellbeloved epaenetus who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ,1,2CO.7
5398,2CO,7,KJV,receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man,therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption,1,2CO.7
5399,2CO,7,KJV,i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you ,for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him,1,2CO.7
5400,2CO,7,KJV,great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation,wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men,1,2CO.7
5401,2CO,7,KJV,for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears,and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory,1,2CO.7
5402,2CO,7,KJV,nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more,of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand,1,2CO.7
5403,2CO,7,KJV,for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season,but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work,1,2CO.7
5404,2CO,7,KJV,now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing,but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house,1,2CO.7
5405,2CO,7,KJV,for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death,and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read,1,2CO.7
5406,2CO,7,KJV,for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter,no man hath seen god at any time,1,2CO.7
5407,2CO,7,KJV,wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you,and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did,1,2CO.7
5408,2CO,7,KJV,therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all,and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest,1,2CO.7
5409,2CO,7,KJV,for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth,now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee,1,2CO.7
5410,2CO,7,KJV,and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him,let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready,1,2CO.7
5411,2CO,7,KJV,i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things,and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still,1,2CO.7
5660,EPH,2,KJV,and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others,for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous,1,EPH.2
5661,EPH,2,KJV,but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus,and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also,1,EPH.2
5662,EPH,2,KJV,for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast,for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea,1,EPH.2
5663,EPH,2,KJV,for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them,now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them,1,EPH.2
5664,EPH,2,KJV,wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ,jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also,1,EPH.2
5665,EPH,2,KJV,for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh,these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you,1,EPH.2
5666,EPH,2,KJV,for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father,to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out,1,EPH.2
5667,EPH,2,KJV,now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit,behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts,1,EPH.2
5673,EPH,4,KJV,i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will,1,EPH.4
5674,EPH,4,KJV,there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all,and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants,1,EPH.4
5675,EPH,4,KJV,but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ,and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land,1,EPH.4
5676,EPH,4,KJV,wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men,these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth,1,EPH.4
5677,EPH,4,KJV,now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth,till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine,1,EPH.4
5678,EPH,4,KJV,he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love,and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them,1,EPH.4
5679,EPH,4,KJV,this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness,let all your things be done with charity,1,EPH.4
5680,EPH,4,KJV,but ye have not so learned christ if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness,but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land and the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship,1,EPH.4
5681,EPH,4,KJV,wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another,then they went out of the city and came unto him,1,EPH.4
5682,EPH,4,KJV,be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil,for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints,1,EPH.4
5683,EPH,4,KJV,let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth,and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man know it but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that country,1,EPH.4
5684,EPH,4,KJV,let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers,then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out,1,EPH.4
5685,EPH,4,KJV,and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption,and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not,1,EPH.4
5686,EPH,4,KJV,let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you,some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel,1,EPH.4
5760,PHP,3,KJV,finally my brethren rejoice in the lord,for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed,1,PHP.3
5761,PHP,3,KJV,to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe,and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee,1,PHP.3
5762,PHP,3,KJV,beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision,and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad,1,PHP.3
5763,PHP,3,KJV,for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh,and not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come,1,PHP.3
5764,PHP,3,KJV,though i might also have confidence in the flesh,so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation,1,PHP.3
5765,PHP,3,KJV,if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless,and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him,1,PHP.3
5766,PHP,3,KJV,but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ,these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone,1,PHP.3
5767,PHP,3,KJV,yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead,and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i,1,PHP.3
5768,PHP,3,KJV,not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus,but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed,1,PHP.3
5769,PHP,3,KJV,brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus,and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john,1,PHP.3
5770,PHP,3,KJV,let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you,then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus,1,PHP.3
5771,PHP,3,KJV,nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing,then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees,1,PHP.3
5772,PHP,3,KJV,brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample,all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out,1,PHP.3

5817,COL,3,KJV,if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god,but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming,1,COL.3

5821,COL,3,KJV,mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them,nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing,1,COL.3
5822,COL,3,KJV,but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth,and they said is not this josephs son,1,COL.3
5823,COL,3,KJV,lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all,and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place,1,COL.3
5824,COL,3,KJV,put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye,but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil,1,COL.3
5825,COL,3,KJV,and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness,and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living,1,COL.3

5828,COL,3,KJV,and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him,i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness,1,COL.3

5834,COL,3,KJV,but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons,and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish,1,COL.3
5851,1TH,1,KJV,paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him,1,1TH.1
5852,1TH,1,KJV,we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father knowing brethren beloved your election of god,not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content,1,1TH.1
5853,1TH,1,KJV,for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake,and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived,1,1TH.1
5854,1TH,1,KJV,and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia,and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things,1,1TH.1
5855,1TH,1,KJV,for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to godward is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing,i thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace,1,1TH.1
5856,1TH,1,KJV,for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come,i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him,1,1TH.1
6054,2TI,3,KJV,this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come,so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god,1,2TI.3
6055,2TI,3,KJV,for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away,epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ saluteth you always labouring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god,1,2TI.3
6056,2TI,3,KJV,for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes,1,2TI.3
6057,2TI,3,KJV,now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith,and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david,1,2TI.3
6058,2TI,3,KJV,but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was,for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope,1,2TI.3
6059,2TI,3,KJV,but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me,but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us ,1,2TI.3
6060,2TI,3,KJV,yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution,then all the disciples forsook him and fled,1,2TI.3
6061,2TI,3,KJV,but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived,i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service,1,2TI.3
6062,2TI,3,KJV,but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus,jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake,1,2TI.3
6063,2TI,3,KJV,all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works,but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto the dogs,1,2TI.3
6135,HEB,2,KJV,therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip,and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act,1,HEB.2
6136,HEB,2,KJV,for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will,and who is sufficient for these things,1,HEB.2
6137,HEB,2,KJV,for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak,but what went ye out for to see,1,HEB.2
6138,HEB,2,KJV,but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him,then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him ,1,HEB.2
6139,HEB,2,KJV,or the son of man that thou visitest him,and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness,1,HEB.2
6140,HEB,2,KJV,thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet,rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep,1,HEB.2
6141,HEB,2,KJV,for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him,be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ,1,HEB.2
6142,HEB,2,KJV,but now we see not yet all things put under him,this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge,1,HEB.2
6143,HEB,2,KJV,but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man,and he spake that saying openly,1,HEB.2
6144,HEB,2,KJV,for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings,so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken,1,HEB.2
6145,HEB,2,KJV,for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee,if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light,1,HEB.2
6146,HEB,2,KJV,and again i will put my trust in him,wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good,1,HEB.2
6147,HEB,2,KJV,and again behold i and the children which god hath given me,but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered,1,HEB.2
6148,HEB,2,KJV,forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage,now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem,1,HEB.2
6149,HEB,2,KJV,for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham,how long shall i suffer you,1,HEB.2
6150,HEB,2,KJV,wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god,1,HEB.2
6151,HEB,2,KJV,for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted,and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth,1,HEB.2
6324,HEB,13,KJV,be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares,and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading,1,HEB.13
6325,HEB,13,KJV,remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body,how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only,1,HEB.13
6326,HEB,13,KJV,marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge,but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you,1,HEB.13
6327,HEB,13,KJV,let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high,1,HEB.13
6328,HEB,13,KJV,so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me,ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness,1,HEB.13
6329,HEB,13,KJV,remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation,and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god,1,HEB.13
6330,HEB,13,KJV,jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever,to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne,1,HEB.13
6331,HEB,13,KJV,be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines,written from rome to the colossians by tychicus and onesimus,1,HEB.13
6332,HEB,13,KJV,for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein,and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid,1,HEB.13
6333,HEB,13,KJV,we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle,and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne,1,HEB.13
6334,HEB,13,KJV,for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp,he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day,1,HEB.13
6335,HEB,13,KJV,wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate,not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven,1,HEB.13
6336,HEB,13,KJV,let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach,well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith,1,HEB.13
6337,HEB,13,KJV,for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come,for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee,1,HEB.13
6338,HEB,13,KJV,by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name,but now we see not yet all things put under him,1,HEB.13
6339,HEB,13,KJV,but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased,but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus,1,HEB.13
6340,HEB,13,KJV,obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you,and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name,1,HEB.13
6341,HEB,13,KJV,pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly,and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition,1,HEB.13
6342,HEB,13,KJV,but i beseech you the rather to do this that i may be restored to you the sooner,the disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his master,1,HEB.13
6343,HEB,13,KJV,now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever,for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord,1,HEB.13
6344,HEB,13,KJV,and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for i have written a letter unto you in few words,i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you,1,HEB.13
6345,HEB,13,KJV,know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whom if he come shortly i will see you,pilate answered am i a jew,1,HEB.13
6346,HEB,13,KJV,salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints,then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons,1,HEB.13
6347,HEB,13,KJV,written to the hebrews from italy by timothy,and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he came unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis,1,HEB.13
6562,1JN,1,KJV,that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ,but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel,1,1JN.1
6563,1JN,1,KJV,and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full,and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him,1,1JN.1
6564,1JN,1,KJV,this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all,and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,1,1JN.1
6565,1JN,1,KJV,if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin,and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers,1,1JN.1
6566,1JN,1,KJV,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them,1,1JN.1
6567,1JN,1,KJV,if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,1,1JN.1
6568,1JN,1,KJV,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us,and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the house,1,1JN.1
6680,2JN,1,KJV,the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever,and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth,1,2JN.1
6681,2JN,1,KJV,grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love,wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for i am holy,1,2JN.1
6682,2JN,1,KJV,i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father,for then would they not have ceased to be offered,1,2JN.1
6683,2JN,1,KJV,and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another,they are not of the world even as i am not of the world,1,2JN.1
6684,2JN,1,KJV,and this is love that we walk after his commandments,now ye are the body of christ and members in particular,1,2JN.1
6685,2JN,1,KJV,this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it,and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing,1,2JN.1
6686,2JN,1,KJV,for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh,and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country,1,2JN.1
6687,2JN,1,KJV,this is a deceiver and an antichrist,they say unto him because no man hath hired us,1,2JN.1
6688,2JN,1,KJV,look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward,ye shall know them by their fruits,1,2JN.1
6689,2JN,1,KJV,whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god,and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye,1,2JN.1
6690,2JN,1,KJV,he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son,and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together,1,2JN.1
6691,2JN,1,KJV,if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds,for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints,1,2JN.1
6692,2JN,1,KJV,having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full,for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers,1,2JN.1
6693,2JN,1,KJV,the children of thy elect sister greet thee,no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day,1,2JN.1
6694,3JN,1,KJV,the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth,if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation,1,3JN.1
6695,3JN,1,KJV,beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth,what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them,1,3JN.1
6696,3JN,1,KJV,for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth,and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out,1,3JN.1
6697,3JN,1,KJV,i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth,there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god,1,3JN.1
6698,3JN,1,KJV,beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well because that for his names sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles,and again behold i and the children which god hath given me,1,3JN.1
6699,3JN,1,KJV,we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth,mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink,1,3JN.1
6700,3JN,1,KJV,i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not,and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode,1,3JN.1
6701,3JN,1,KJV,wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the church,but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased,1,3JN.1
6702,3JN,1,KJV,beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good,for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,1,3JN.1
6703,3JN,1,KJV,he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god,for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god,1,3JN.1
6704,3JN,1,KJV,demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true,for by it the elders obtained a good report,1,3JN.1

6725,REV,1,KJV,blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand,for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country,1,REV.1
6726,REV,1,KJV,john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth,then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses,1,REV.1
6727,REV,1,KJV,unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever,some mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after,1,REV.1
6728,REV,1,KJV,behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him,and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable,1,REV.1
6729,REV,1,KJV,i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty,i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture,1,REV.1
6730,REV,1,KJV,i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ,all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence,1,REV.1
6731,REV,1,KJV,i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea,pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him,1,REV.1
6732,REV,1,KJV,and i turned to see the voice that spake with me,and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden,1,REV.1
6733,REV,1,KJV,and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle,but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire,1,REV.1
6734,REV,1,KJV,his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters,for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out,1,REV.1
6735,REV,1,KJV,and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength,there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry,1,REV.1
6736,REV,1,KJV,and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead,wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ,1,REV.1
6737,REV,1,KJV,and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death,and he said legion because many devils were entered into him,1,REV.1
6738,REV,1,KJV,write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks,for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband,1,REV.1
6739,REV,1,KJV,the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches,it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak,1,REV.1
6782,REV,4,KJV,after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter,why are they then baptized for the dead,1,REV.4
6783,REV,4,KJV,and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne,and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot,1,REV.4
6784,REV,4,KJV,and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald,for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him,1,REV.4
6785,REV,4,KJV,and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold,and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel,1,REV.4
6786,REV,4,KJV,and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god,and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me,1,REV.4
6787,REV,4,KJV,and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind,neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,1,REV.4
6788,REV,4,KJV,and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle,and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room,1,REV.4
6789,REV,4,KJV,and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come,and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods,1,REV.4
6790,REV,4,KJV,and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created,and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man,1,REV.4
6791,REV,5,KJV,and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness,1,REV.5
6792,REV,5,KJV,and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof,i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be,1,REV.5
6793,REV,5,KJV,and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon,for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,1,REV.5
6794,REV,5,KJV,and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon,but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary,1,REV.5
6795,REV,5,KJV,and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof,be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners,1,REV.5
6796,REV,5,KJV,and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth,and when even was come he went out of the city,1,REV.5
6797,REV,5,KJV,and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne,and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him,1,REV.5
6798,REV,5,KJV,and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints,and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men,1,REV.5
6799,REV,5,KJV,and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth,if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward,1,REV.5
6800,REV,5,KJV,and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing,father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world,1,REV.5
6801,REV,5,KJV,and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever,nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness,1,REV.5
6802,REV,5,KJV,and the four beasts said amen,and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest,1,REV.5
6803,REV,5,KJV,and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever,and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs,1,REV.5
6872,REV,10,KJV,and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices,for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill,1,REV.10
6873,REV,10,KJV,and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not,and they that were crucified with him reviled him,1,REV.10
6874,REV,10,KJV,and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets,and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye,1,REV.10
6875,REV,10,KJV,and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth,mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them,1,REV.10
6876,REV,10,KJV,and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book,is not this the carpenters son,1,REV.10
6877,REV,10,KJV,and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey,and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him,1,REV.10
6878,REV,10,KJV,and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter,thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body,1,REV.10
6879,REV,10,KJV,and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings,and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all,1,REV.10
6915,REV,13,KJV,and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy,and the same time there arose no small stir about that way,1,REV.13
6916,REV,13,KJV,and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority,and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink,1,REV.13
6917,REV,13,KJV,and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast,remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body,1,REV.13
6918,REV,13,KJV,and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets,1,REV.13
6919,REV,13,KJV,who is able to make war with him,then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast,1,REV.13
6920,REV,13,KJV,and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months,and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name,1,REV.13
6921,REV,13,KJV,and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven,he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end,1,REV.13
6922,REV,13,KJV,and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations,if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men,1,REV.13
6923,REV,13,KJV,and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world,and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did,1,REV.13
6924,REV,13,KJV,if any man have an ear let him hear,and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day,1,REV.13
6925,REV,13,KJV,he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword,the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the lord endureth for ever,1,REV.13
6926,REV,13,KJV,here is the patience and the faith of the saints,and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom,1,REV.13
6927,REV,13,KJV,and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon,and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people,1,REV.13
6928,REV,13,KJV,and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed,let all things be done decently and in order,1,REV.13
6929,REV,13,KJV,and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live,and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them,1,REV.13
6930,REV,13,KJV,and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed,was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness,1,REV.13
6931,REV,13,KJV,and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name,and how then will ye know all parables,1,REV.13
6932,REV,13,KJV,let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six,demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true,1,REV.13
6933,REV,14,KJV,and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers name written in their foreheads,wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways,1,REV.14
6934,REV,14,KJV,and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth,and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal,1,REV.14
6935,REV,14,KJV,these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins,wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord,1,REV.14
6936,REV,14,KJV,these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth,after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them,1,REV.14
6937,REV,14,KJV,these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb,and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john,1,REV.14
6938,REV,14,KJV,and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god,and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum,1,REV.14
6939,REV,14,KJV,and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters,and jesus said unto him thou sayest,1,REV.14
6940,REV,14,KJV,and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,art thou loosed from a wife,1,REV.14
6941,REV,14,KJV,and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master thus saying thou reproachest us also,1,REV.14
6942,REV,14,KJV,here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus,and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying maid arise,1,REV.14
6943,REV,14,KJV,and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do follow them,therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable,1,REV.14
6944,REV,14,KJV,and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle,be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him,1,REV.14
6945,REV,14,KJV,and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe,heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away,1,REV.14
6946,REV,14,KJV,and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped,eubulus greeteth thee and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brethren,1,REV.14
6947,REV,14,KJV,and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle,and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil,1,REV.14
6948,REV,14,KJV,and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe,as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep,1,REV.14
6949,REV,14,KJV,and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god,for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed,1,REV.14
6950,REV,14,KJV,and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs,and when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore,1,REV.14
6959,REV,16,KJV,and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth,and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more,1,REV.16
6960,REV,16,KJV,and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image,but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny,1,REV.16
6961,REV,16,KJV,and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea,then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable,1,REV.16
6962,REV,16,KJV,and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood,for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased,1,REV.16
6963,REV,16,KJV,and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus,and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight,1,REV.16
6964,REV,16,KJV,for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy,he that hateth me hateth my father also,1,REV.16
6965,REV,16,KJV,and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous are thy judgments,for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand,1,REV.16
6966,REV,16,KJV,and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire,and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice,1,REV.16
