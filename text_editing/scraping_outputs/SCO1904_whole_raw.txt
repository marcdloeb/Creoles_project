The buik oʼ the generation oʼ Jesus the Christ, Dauvidʼs son, the son oʼ Abʼram. Abʼram begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jaucob; and Jaucob begat Judah and his brethren. And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah oʼ Tamar; and Pharez begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram. And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon. And Salmon begat Boaz, oʼ Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed, oʼ Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse. And Jesse begat Dauvid the king; and Dauvid the king begat Solomon, oʼ her wha was Uriahʼs. And Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa. And Asa begat Jehosaphat; and Jehosaphat begat Jehoram; and Jehoram begat Uzziah. And Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah. And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah. And Josiah begat Jehoiachin and his brethren, nar‐haun the time they war carryʼt awaʼ to Babylon. And eftir they cam to Babylon, Jehoiachin begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zerubbabel. And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor. And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud. And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jaucob. And Jaucob begat Joseph, Maryʼs husband, oʼ wham was born Jesus, wha is caʼd “The Christ.” Sae aʼ the generations frae Abʼram to Dauvid are fowrteen generations; and frae Dauvid to the takin awaʼ to Babylon fowrteen generations; and frae the takin awaʼ to Babylon to Christ fowrteen generations. Noo the nativitie oʼ Jesus Christ was thisgate: whan his mither Mary was mairryʼt till Joseph, ʼor they cam thegither, she was fund wiʼ bairn oʼ the Holie Spirit. Than her guidman, Joseph, bein an upricht man, and no desirin her name soud be iʼthe mooth oʼ the public, was ettlin to pit her awaʼ hidlins. But as he had thir things in his mind, see! an Angel oʼ the Lord appearit till him by a dream, sayin, “Joseph, son oʼ Dauvid, binna feared to tak till ye yere wife, Mary; for that whilk is begotten in her is by the Holie Spirit. “And she sal bring forth a son, and ye shall caʼ his name JESUS; for he sal  save his folk frae their sins.” Noo, aʼ this was dune, that it might come to pass what was said by the Lord throwe the prophet, “Tak tent! a maiden sal be wiʼ bairn, and sal bring forth a son; and they wull caʼ his name Emmanuel,” whilk is, translatit, “God wiʼ us.” Sae Joseph, comin oot oʼ his sleep, did as the Angel had bidden him, and took till him his wife. And leevʼd in continence wiʼ her till she had brocht forth her first‐born son; and caʼd his name JESUS. Noo, whan Jesus was born iʼ Bethlehem‐Judah, iʼ the days oʼ King Herod, lo! Wyss Men cam frae the  East tae Jerusalem. And quoʼ they, “Whaur is he bidin that is caʼd King oʼ the Jews? for iʼ the East we saw his starn, and are come forrit to worship him.” But the King, hearin, was sair putten‐about; and aʼ Jerusalem wiʼ him. And, gatherin aʼ the heigh‐priests and writers oʼ the nation, he wad ken oʼ them “whaur the Messiah soud be born?” And quoʼ they, “In Bethlehem‐Judah; for sae it is putten doon by the prophet: “ ‘And thou, Bethlehem, land oʼ Judah, nane the least amang Judahʼs princes! for oot oʼ thee sal come a Ruler, wha sal tend my folk oʼ Israʼl!’ ” Than, Herod, convenin the Wyss Men privately, faund oot mair strickly oʼ the comin oʼ the starn; And bad them gang to Bethlehem; and quoʼ he, “Gang, and seek ye oot the wee bairn; and whan ye ken, fesh me word again, that I as weel may come and worship.” Eftir hearin the King, they gaed awaʼ; and lo! the starn whilk they saw iʼ the East gaed on afore them, till it stood whaur the wee bairn was. And whan they saw the starn, they were blythe wiʼ unco blytheness. And comin intil the hoose, they saw the wee bairn, and his mither Mary; and loutin doon, worshippʼt him. And openinʼ oot their gear, they offerʼt till him gifts — gowd, and frankincense, and myrrh. And bein warned in a dream no to go back till Herod, they airtit their way to their ain kintra anither gate. Noo whan they had gane, tak tent! an Angel oʼ the Lord appearʼt to Joseph by a dream, and quoʼ he, “Rise, tak till ye the wee bairn, and his mither, and flee intil Egypt, and bide ye thar till I tell ye; for Herod seeks the wee bairn to destroy him.” And he, risin, took the wee bairn and his mither by nicht, and cam intil Egypt. And bade there till Herodʼs death: that it soud be fulfilled what was said by the Lord throwe the prophet, “Frae Egypt hae I caʼd my Son.” Than Herod, seein he was made sport oʼ by the Wyss Men, was unco furious, and sent oot to slay aʼ the lad‐bairns in Bethlehem, and aʼ the kintra‐side aboot, frae twa‐year auld doon: conform tae the time he had been tellʼt by the Wyss Men. Than cam to pass the sayin oʼ Jeremiah the prophet: “A voice was heard in Ramah, greetin and maenin, and murnin sair; Raʼhel greetin for her weans, and wadna be comfortit, for that they are‐na!” But Herod deein, look! an Angel oʼ the Lord by dream appears to Joseph in Egypt. And quoʼ he, “Rise! tak the wee bairn and his mither, and journey intil Israʼlʼs land; for they that socht the wee bairnʼs life are deid.” And he raise, and took till him the wee bairn and his mither, and cam intil the land oʼ Israʼl. But whan it was tellʼt him that Archelaus rang in Judea in the stead oʼ Herod his faither, he was fleyʼt to gang thar: but, being instruckit in a dream, he gaed intil the pairts oʼ Galilee: And cam and dwalt in a citie caʼd Nazareth; that it soud come to pass that was said by the prophet, “He will be caʼd a Nazarene.” Noo, iʼ thae days, comes John the Baptist, preachinʼ iʼ the muirlands oʼ Judea. And quoʼ he, “Repent ye aʼ! for the kingdom oʼ Heeven is at haun!” For it is he wha was tellʼt oʼ by Esaiah the prophet, sayin, “The sough oʼ ane crying oot iʼ the waste, ‘Mak ye ready a gate for the Lord! Strauchten oot his fitpath!’ ” And John his sel had his cleedin oʼ camelʼs hair, and a belt oʼ a skin; and his meat was locusts and rock hinny. And thar war gangin oot till him Jerusalem and aʼ Judah, and the kintra‐side aboot Jordan; And war bapteezʼt by him in Jordan; confessin aʼ their sin. But whan he saw a hantle oʼ the Pharisees and Sadducees come till his bapteezin, quoʼ he to them, “Eh, ye venomous race! Wha has gien ye warninʼ to flee frae comin wrath? “Fesh than forth the frutes conform till repentance! “And say‐ye‐na to yersels, ‘We hae Abraʼm till oor faither!’ for say I tʼye, God coud raise up oot oʼ thir stanes, bairns to Abraʼm! “And noo is the aixe brocht to the rute oʼ the trees; and ilka tree bringin na forth gude frute is cuttit doon, and cuisten intil the burnin. “I, indeed, div in watir bapteeze ye intil repentance; but he wha follows me is sterker nor mysel; whase shoon Iʼse no fit to cairry; he sal bapteeze ye wiʼ Holie Spirit, and flaughts oʼ fire. “Whase fanner is in his neive, and heʼse  scour‐oot his threshin‐flair, and gaither his wheat intil his girnal; but the cauff wull he burn in nevir‐endin lowe!” Than cam Jesus frae Galilee tae John, to be bapteezʼt oʼ him. Noo, John wad hae forbidden him; and quoʼ he, “I hae need oʼ thy bapteezin, and come ye to me?” But Jesus answerʼt him, and said, “Sae be it e noo; for sae it behoves us to fulfil aʼ richt‐gangin!” Than he contentit him. And Jesus, whan he was bapteezʼt, gaed up straucht frae the watir, and lo! the heevens war unsteekit till him, and he saw the Spirit oʼ God comin doon like a doo, and lichtin upon him. And tak tent! a voice oot oʼ the lift, sayin, “This is my Son, my Beloved, in wham I delicht!” Than was Jesus airtit by the Spirit intil the wilderness, thar to be testit oʼ the Enemy. And whan he had fastit for forty days and nichts, he was spent wiʼ hunger. And whan the Tempter cam till him, quoʼ he, “Gin thou be Godʼs Son, speak to thir stanes, that they be bannocks!” But he, answerin till him, said, “No allenarlie on breid leeves man, but by ilk word oʼ Godʼs mooth!” Than the deevil taks him wiʼ him intil the holie citie, and pits him on the tapmaist towerickie oʼ the Temple. And quoʼ he till him, “Gin ye be Godʼs Son, cast yersel ower; for it is putten‐doon, ‘Till his Angels sal he gie chairge anent ye; and on their hauns sal they haud ye up, that ye clour‐na yere fit again a stane!’ ” Quoʼ Jesus till him, “Ance mair it is putten‐doon, ‘Ye sanna temp the Lord yere God!’ ” And again the Enemy taks him up intil an unco heigh mountain, and airts him till aʼ the kingdoms oʼ the yirth, and aʼ their glorie; And says till him, “Aʼ thae things gie I tʼye gin ye, faʼin doon, gie worship to me!” Than quoʼ Jesus till him, “Awa, Sautan! for it is putten‐doon, ‘The Lord yere God sal ye worship; and him alane sal ye serʼ!’ ” Than the deevil quats him; and lo! the Angels cam to serʼ him. Noo whan it was tellʼt him that John was taen haud oʼ, he gaed awaʼ intil Galilee: And forsakin Nazareth, he cam and made his dwallin iʼ Capernaum, on the side oʼ the Loch, on the border oʼ Zabulon and Naphtali; That it micht come to pass what said Esaiah the Prophet, “Land oʼ Zabulon! and land oʼ Naphtali! Galilee oʼ the nations! “The folk that were sittin iʼ the mirk, saw an unco licht; and till aʼ thae sittin iʼ the land and the mirkness oʼ the deid, the licht raise up!” Frae that time forth begude Jesus to preach; and quoʼ he, “Repent ye! for Heevenʼs kingdom draws nar‐haun!” And walkin by the Loch oʼ Galilee, he saw twa brithers, Simon, (caʼd Peter), and Andro his brither, castin aboot a net iʼ the Loch, for they war fisher‐folk. And quoʼ he to them, “Follow ye me! and Iʼse mak ye fishers oʼ men!” And they, withoot ado, left the nets, and gaed eftir him. And gangin forrit tharawa, he saw ither twa brithers, James, son oʼ Zebedee, and his brither John, in a smack wiʼ Zebedee their faither, workin on their nets: and he bad them “Come!” And they, forsakin the boat, and their faither, gaed eftir him. And Jesus gaed ower aʼ Galilee, instructin iʼ their kirks, and giean forth the Blythe‐Message oʼ the Kingdom, and healin aʼ diseases, and aʼ infirmities amang the folk. And the sough oʼ him gaed oot intil aʼ Syria: and they feshʼt till him aʼ wha war ill wiʼ aʼ diseases and pains, and thae possessʼt wiʼ demons, and dementit, and that had a stroke: and he healed them. And unco thrangs followʼt him — frae Galilee, and the Ten Cities, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and ayont the Jordan. And, seein the thrang oʼ folk, he gaed up intil a mountain; and whan he was sutten‐doon, his disciples gatherʼt aboot. And he openʼt his mooth, and instructit them; and quoʼ he: “Happy the spirits that are lown and cannie: for the kingdom oʼ Heeven is waitin for them! “Happy they wha are makin their maen; for they sal finʼ comfort and peace. “Happy the lowly and meek oʼ the yirth: for the  yirth sal be their ain haddin. “Happy they whase hunger and drouth are aʼ for holiness: for they sal be satisfyʼt! “Happy the pitfuʼ: for they sal win pitie theirsels! “Happy the pure‐heartit: for their een sal dwal upon God! “Happy the makkers‐up oʼ strife: for they sal be coontit for bairns oʼ God! “Happy the ill‐treatit anes for the sake oʼ gude: for theyʼse hae the kingdom oʼ God! “Happy sal ye be when folk sal miscaʼ ye, and ill‐treat ye, and say aʼ things again ye wrangouslie for my sake! “Joy ye, and be blythe! for yere meed is great in Heeven! for eʼen sae did they to the prophets afore ye! “The saut oʼ the yirth are ye: but gin the saut hae tint its tang, hooʼs it to be sautit? Is it no clean useless? to be cuisten oot, and trauchlʼt under folkʼs feet. “Ye are the warldʼs licht. A toon biggit on a hill‐tap is aye seen. “Nor wad men licht a crusie, and pit it neath a cog, but set it up; and it gies licht to aʼ the hoose. “Sae lat yere licht gang abreid amang men; that seein yere gude warks they may gie God glorie. “Think‐na I am come to do awaʼ wiʼ the Law, or the Prophets: Iʼse no come to do awaʼ, but to bring to pass! “For truly say I tʼye, Till Heeven and Yirth dwine awaʼ, ae jot or ae tittle fails‐na oʼ aʼ the Law, till aʼ comes to pass! “Than, wha breaks ane oʼ thae weeʼst commauns, and gars ithers sae do, he sal be caʼd sma iʼ the kingdom oʼ Heeven: but wha sal keep them, and spread them abreid, he sal be caʼd great iʼ the kingdom oʼ Heeven. “For I say till ye, Gin yere gudeness gang‐na yont the Scribes and Pharisees, neʼer sal ye win intil the kingdom oʼ Heeven! “Ye ken hoo it was spoken till the folk oʼ auld: ‘Ye maunna kill; and whasae kills is in danger oʼ the Coort.’ “But say I tʼye, Whasae is angry wiʼ his brither‐man, sal be in danger oʼ the Coort: and wha sal say to his brither‐man, ‘Gonyel!’ sal be in danger oʼ the Cooncil: but wha sal say ‘Fule!’ sal be in danger oʼ the fire oʼ hell! “Sae, gin ye fesh yere offerin to the altar‐place, and thar bethink ye oʼ a sairness in a britherʼs mind anent ye, “Pit doon yere gift fornent the offerin‐stane, and haud awa; first, be at ane wiʼ yere brither‐man, and syne come and offer yere gift! “Mak up wiʼ yere enemy while ye are yet in the highway wiʼ him; sae as he gies‐ye‐na ower to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and ye be cuisten intil prison. “Truly say I tʼye, Ye come‐na oot, till ye ha paid the last bodle! “Ye hae heard it was said lang syne, ‘Ye sanna commit adultery!’ “But say I tʼye, Whasae sets his een on a wumman wiʼ desire, has eʼen e‐noo committit the sin wiʼ her in his heart! “And gin yere richt ee ensnare ye, oot wʼit, and cast it frae ye! it is for yere gude that ae member soud be destroyʼt, and no that yere hail body soud faʼ intil hell! “And gin yere richt haun ensnare ye, cut it aff, and cast it awa! better for ye that ae member soud fail, and no that yere hail body soud faʼ intil hell! “The sayin has been, ‘Whasae pits awa his wife, lat him gie her a written divorcement!’ “But say I, Whasae pits awa his wife, let abee for the cause oʼ adultery, gars her commit adultery; and whasae weds her that is putten awa commits adultery. “Ance mair, ye ken it has been said by them oʼ by‐past time, ‘Ye sanna mansweer yersel, but yeʼse render to the Lord yere aiths!’ “But say I, Sweer‐na ava! no by Heeven, for it is Godʼs thron: “Nor yet by the Yirth, for it is his fit‐brod: nor Jerusalem, for it is the citie oʼ the Great King. “Nor sal ye sweer by yere ain heid for ye canna mak ae hair white nor black. “But lat yere answer be, ‘Aye, aye,’ and ‘Na, na!’ for onything mair comes oʼ nae gude. “Ye ken it has been said, ‘An ee for an ee, and a tooth for a tooth!’ “But say I, Resist‐ye na ill; but gin ane clour ye on the ae cheek, turn ye till him the ither as weel. “And gin ony man hae a law‐plea wiʼ ye, and tak awa yere coat, eʼen lat him hae the cloak as weel. “And gin ye be impressʼd for a mile wiʼ ane, gang ane mair wiʼ him. “Gie till him seekin frae ye; and frae him wha wad receive oʼ ye turn‐ye‐no awa. “Ye ken it has been said, ‘Ye sal loʼe yere neebor, and hate yere fae.’ “But say I, Loʼe yere faes; bless the anes that ban and curse ye; seek the gude oʼ thae that hate ye; and pray for sic as shamefully ill‐treat ye, and seek for yere wrang: “That ye aʼ may be bairns oʼ yere Faither in Heeven; for he gars his sun to glint alike on the ill and on the gude; and sends oot his rain baith on the just and the unjust. “For gin ye but loʼe whaur thar is love till yersel, whaur is yere meed? divna eʼen the reivin tax‐men do the same? “And gin ye but speir eftir yere ain kith, how div ye mair nor ither folk? divna eʼen the tax‐men sae? “But ye maun be perfete, eʼen as yere Faither Aboon is perfete!” “Tak tent no to do yere gude warks iʼ the sicht oʼ men, that ye may be seen by them; else hae ye tint reward frae yere Faither wha is in Heeven. “Whan, than, ye wad do a gude wark, dinna hae a bugle‐horn soondit afore ye, as the pretenders div in kirks and merkits, that they may be roosed oʼ men. Truly say I tʼye, they hae gotten aʼ their reward! “But whan ye wad do a gude wark, lat yere left haun no jalouse what yere richt haun is thrang wiʼ! “That yere gude warks may be dune hidlins; and yere Faither wha sees iʼ the hidlin place, sal his ain sel reward ye. “And whaneʼer ye pray be‐na as the pretenders; for weel they like to pray iʼ the kirks, and at the corners oʼ the braid causeys, sae as folk soud see them. Aye, aye! say I; they hae gotten their reward! “But ye, whan ye wad pray, gang intil yere bower; and, steekin yere door, pray till yere Faither wha is iʼ the hidlin place; and yere Faither, wha sees iʼ the hidlin place, sal his ain sel reward ye! “And in yere prayin, rhyme‐na things ower and ower, incontinent, like the heathen‐folk: for they trow gin that they speak eneuch, they sal be heard. “Come‐na than to be like tae them; for yere Faither kens weel aʼ yere needs, eʼen afore ye ask him. “And sae pray ye: ‘Faither oʼ us a,’ biding Aboon! Thy name be holie! “ ‘Lat thy reign begin! Lat thy wull be dune, on the Yirth as in Heeven! “ ‘Gie us ilka day oor needfuʼ fendin. “ ‘And forgie us aʼ oor ill deeds, as we eʼen forgae thae wha did us ill: “ ‘And lat us no be siftit; but save us frae the  Ill‐Ane! For the croon is thine ain, and the micht and the glorie, for evir and evir, Amen!’ “For gin ye be forgiean men their fauts, yere Faither in Heeven wull eʼen forgie you. “But gif ye are no forgiean men their fauts, nae mair wull yere Faither forgie our fauts. “And again, whan ye are fastin, ye arena to be as the pretenders, wiʼ wae iʼ yere faces; for they mar their looks, that they may kythe afore men as fastin. Aye, aye! say I, they too hae their reward! “But ye, whan ye fast, snod yere heid, and freshen yere face; “That ye, be‐na seen by men to be fastin, but seen oʼ yere Faither wha is eʼen iʼ the hidlin place: and yere Faither, wha sees iʼ the hidlin place, his ain sel sal reward ye. “Lay‐na up gear for yersels on the yirth whaur the moth and the rust can mak awa wiʼt, and whaur thieves howk throwe and steal. “But lay ye up gear in Heeven, whaur nae moth and nae rust can mak‐awa wiʼt, and whaur thieves canna howk throwe nor steal. “For whaur your treasur lies, eʼen thar yere heart wull be! “The lamp oʼ the hail body is the ee; than, gin aiblins yere ee is aefauld and leal, yere hail body is fuʼ oʼ licht. “But gin yere ee be dooble and ill, yere hail body bides iʼ the mirk. Gin, than, the vera licht within ye is but gloom, hoo unco great is the gloom! “Nae man can tak service wiʼ twa maisters; for aither he wull lichtlie the ane, and loʼe the ither; or incontinent he wull haud by the ane, and care‐na for the ither. Ye canna be in Godʼs service, and Mammonʼs as weel! “Wharfor say I tʼye, Be‐na sair fashʼd wiʼ cark and care anent yere life — what you are to eat and what ye are to drink! nor yet for yere body, hoo ye are to be cleedit! Isna the life mair nor the meat? and the body mair nor the cleedin? “Look ye to the wee birdies iʼ the lift; for they naither saw nor shear, nor lead intil the barn; and yet yere Heevenlie Faither gies them meat. Are‐ye‐na a hantle better nor they? “And wha amang ye, be he nevir sae fain, could mak his sel a span heigher? “And anent cleedin; why soud ye hae sae muckle cark and care? Look weel at the lilies oʼ the lea, hoo they growe; they toil‐na, nor spin; “And yet say I, that Solomon in aʼ his glorie was‐na buskit braw like ane oʼ thae! “Noo than, gin God sae cleed the foggage, (the day on the lea, and the morn brunt iʼ the oven), hoo muckle mair you, O ye oʼ the smaʼ faith! “Sae be‐na sair trauchlʼt in yere mind, sayin, ‘What sal we eat?ʼ or ‘What sal we drink?ʼ or ‘Hoo sal we be cleedit?’ “For oʼ aʼ thae things div the Nations seek eftir; but yere Heevenlie Faither kens weel that ye need aʼ thae things. “But seek ye first oʼ aʼ Godʼs reign and Godʼs richtousness; and aʼ thir things sal be addit till ye. “Hae than nae wearin‐care anent the day to come: for the morn wull hae care oʼ its ain. Eneuch for the day is its ain ill! “Judge‐na; that ye be‐na judged! “For wiʼ yere ain judgment sal ye be judged yersel; and wiʼ yere ain firlot sal yere corn be measurʼt till ye? “And why soud ye craftily spy oot the mote iʼ yere britherʼs ee, and think‐na oʼ the caber iʼ yere ain ee? “Or wull ye say till yere brither, ‘Thole ye, till I tak oot the mote frae yere ee!’ and behauld! a caber is in yere ain ee! “Pretender! oot wiʼ the caber frae yere ain ee first! and then may ye hae gude sicht to puʼ the mote oot oʼ yere britherʼs ee! “Ye maunna gie holie things to dowgs; nor yet cast pearls afore swine; that they trauchle them‐na aneath their feet, and than turn on ye and rive ye. “Ask, and it sal be gien tʼye; seek, and ye sal hae; chap, and it sal be unsteekit tʼye. “For ilk ane that asks obteens; and he finʼs wha seeks; and till him wha chaps it sal be openʼt. “And whatna man is amang ye, wha — gin his son asks for breid — wad gie him a stane? “Or, gin he asks a fish, wull he gie him a viper? “Gin ye, than, bein sinfuʼ, ken hoo to be aye gien gude things till yere ain bairns, hoo muckle mair sal yere Faither wha is Aboon gie gude things to thae that ask oʼ him! “And sae, aʼ things whatsoeʼer ye wad that men soud do till yersel, div ye do eʼen sae tae them; for this is the hail Law and the Prophets. “Gang ye in at the strett yett; for muckle is the yett, and braid is the causey, that leads on to destruction; and mony a ane gangs intilʼt! “For strett is the yett, and crampit is the fit‐road that airts awa to life; and but a wee wheen find it! “Tak ye tent oʼ fause‐prophets, whilk come tʼye in sheepʼs‐cleedin, but iʼ the hinner‐end are devoorin wolves! “Ye may  ken them by their frutes. Dae folk gather grapes frae the thorns, or figs amang thrissles? “Eʼen sae, ilka gude tree brings forth gude frute; but a fushionless tree brings forth ill frute. “A gude tree winna bring forth ill frute; nor can a fushionless tree gie gude frute. “Ilka tree that brings‐na forth gude frute is cuttit doon, and cuisten intil the fire. “Sae by their frutes ye sal aye ken them. “It isna ilka ane that cries oot ‘Lord, Lord!’ that gangs intil the Kingdom oʼ Heeven; but he that daes the wull oʼ my Faither wha is in Heeven. “Mony a ane wull say to me iʼ that day, ‘Lord, Lord! prophesyʼt we‐na iʼ thy name? And cuist‐we‐na oot demons iʼ thy name? And did‐we‐na mony ferlies iʼ thy name?’ “And than wull I confess till them, ‘I never kent ye! Depairt frae me, ye that cairry‐oot wrang!’ “And sae ilka ane hearin and performin thir sayins oʼ mine, sal be likenʼt till a wyss man, wha biggit his hoose on the rock. “And the rain fell, and the spate cam, and the winʼs blew and stormed again that hoose; and it fell‐na, for it stude siccar on the rock! “And ilka ane wha hears and dis‐na thir sayins oʼ mine, sal be like till a sumph wha biggit his hoose on the sand: “And the rain fell, and the spate cam, and the winʼs blew and stormed again that hoose; and it whammlʼt ower; and muckle was the faʼ oʼt!” And it cam aboot, whan Jesus had endit thir words, the folk war amazed at his teachin; For he spak till them as ane that had authoritie, and no like the Writers. And whan he cam doon frae the mountain, great thrangs oʼ folk followʼt him. And lo! a leper cam and worshippʼt him, and said, “Lord! gin ye wad, ye coud mak me clean!” And Jesus pat oot his haun, and touched him, sayin, “I wull, be ye clean!” And at aince his leprosie was healed. And Jesus chairged him, “See that ye tell nane; but gang yere ways till the priest, and gie ye the gift commandit by Moses, for a token to them!” And whan Jesus cam intil Capernaum, thar cam till him a Captain, and besocht him, Sayin, “Lord! my servant‐lad is doon wiʼ a stroke, in my hoose, in unco pain!” Quoʼ Jesus till him, “I wull come and heal him!” And the Captain answerʼt, “Lord! I am‐na fit ye soud come aneath my roof; but only say the word, and my servant‐lad sal be weel! “For eʼen I my sel,  a man aneath authoritie, hae sodgers under me; and I say till ane ‘Gang,’ and he gangs; and till another ‘Come,’ and he comes; and till my servant‐lad, ‘Do sae and sae,’ and he dis it!” Hearin this, Jesus ferlied; and said to them that followʼt, “I haena fund sic faith as this, no in aʼ Israʼl! “And I say tʼye, Mony sal come frae the East and frae the Wast, and sit doon wiʼ Abraʼm, and Isaac, and Jaucob, iʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven, “But the sons oʼ the kingdom sal be cuisten oot intil the mirk oot‐by: thar sal be greetin and cherkin oʼ teeth!” And Jesus said to the Captain, “Gang yere ways! Eʼen as ye lippened, sae sal it be dune tʼye.” And his servant‐lad was made weel iʼ that same ʼoor. And Jesus, enterin Peterʼs hoose, saw his gude‐mither lyin, doon wiʼ a fivver. And he touched her haun, and the fivver was gane. And she raise, and waitit on him. But whan the gloamin cam on, they brocht till him a hantle wiʼ evil spirits, and he cuist oot the spirits wiʼ a word, and healed aʼ the sick: That sae micht the words oʼ Esaiah be fulfilled, wha threepit, “He his ain sel took oor sillinesses, and bure oor sicknesses!” Noo Jesus, seein great thrangs aboot him, commandit to gang ower to the ither side. And a certain Writer cam, and quoʼ he, “Maister! I wull follow ye, whaursaeʼer ye may gang!” Jesus said till him, “The tods hae holes, and the birdies oʼ the lift hae nests; but the Son oʼ Man hasna whaur his heid may lie!” And anither oʼ his followers says, “Lord! lat me first gang till my faitherʼs burial!” But Jesus says till him, “Follow ye me! and lea the deid to bury their ain deid!” And whaun he gaed intil a boat his disciples followʼt him. And see! a great storm raise on the Loch; and wave efteir wave gaed ower the boat: but he was sleepin. And comin till him, they roused him, sayin, “Maister! save us: we perish!” And he says to them, “Why soud ye be fleyʼt? ye oʼ sic smaʼ faith!” Than he raise, and challenged the winds and the sea. And aʼ was lown! And the men ferlied uncolie, sayin, “Whatna man is this, that eʼen the winds and the watirs obey him?” And whan he cam to the ither side, to the pairts oʼ the Gadarenes, thar met him twa possessʼt anes, comin oot oʼ the tombs, unco fierce, sae that nane daur gang that gate. And see! they cryʼt oot, “What hae we wiʼ you, Son oʼ God! Are ye come to torment us ʼor the time?” Noo thar war feedin, a gey bit aff frae them, a great herd oʼ swine. Sae the evil spirits besocht him, sayin, “Gin ye cast us oot, send us intil the herd oʼ swine!” And he said to them, “Gang!” And whan they cam oot, they gied intil the herd oʼ swine; and lo! aʼ the herd rushed doon the scaur intil the Loch, and perished iʼ the watirs. And they that herdit them fled and gaed their gate to the citie, and tellʼt aʼ; and what had befaun the possessʼt anes. And lo! aʼ the citie cam oot to meet Jesus: and whan they saw him they besocht him to gang awa frae their borders. And he enterʼt the boat, and gaed ower, and cam till his ain toun. And behauld! they war bringin till him a man doon wiʼ a stroke, lyin on a couch: and Jesus, seein their aefauldness says tae the man, “Bairn, be oʼ gude heart; yere sins are forgien ye!” And mark! thar war Writers sayin within theirsels, “This ane speaks profaneness!” And Jesus, kennin their thochts, says, “Why soud ye think ill in yere hearts? “Whilk is easier to say, ‘Yere sins are forgien!’ or to say, ‘Rise ye, and walk?’ “But sae as ye may ken the Son oʼ Man has authoritie on the yirth to forgie sins, (quoʼ he till the ane wiʼ a stroke,) Rise ye, tak up yere bed, and gang yere ways till yere ain hoose!” And he, risin up, gaed awa till his ain hoose. And aʼ the folk, seein it war dauntit wiʼ fear, and glorifyʼt God for gien sic pooer to men! And as Jesus gaed on frae that, he saw a man caʼd Matthew, sittin whaur the dues were paid; and he says till him, “Follow ye me!” And he raise, and followʼt him. And it cam aboot, as he was at meat iʼ the hoose, that behauld! mony tax‐men and ill‐deedie anes cam and sat doon wiʼ him and his disciples. And whan the Pharisees saw that, quoʼ they till his disciples, “Hoo isʼt that yere maister taks meat wiʼ tax‐folk and ill‐deedie anes?” Noo Jesus heard; and quoʼ he to them, “Itʼs no the hale anes that need the leech, but thae that are ill. “But gang ye and learn what that sets forth, ‘I wad suner hae mercie nor sacrifeece; for I am‐na come to caʼ the richtous, but sinners.” Than the disciples oʼ John cam till him; and quoʼ they, “Hoo isʼt that we fast muckle — and the Pharisees — but yere disciples haena to fast?” And Jesus says to them, “Can the bairns oʼ the bridal‐bower fast whan the bridegroom is wiʼ them? But the days come, whan the bridegroom is taen awa frae them, and than wull they fast! “And nae ane pits a clout oʼ new claith on an auld coat, for in waukin‐up it rives awa frae the cleedin, and the hole is made waur. “Nor div men pit new wine intil auld skins; else the skins rive, and the wine skails; and the skins are destroyʼt: but they pit new wine intil new wine‐skins, and baith are keepit.” And, meanwhile he was speakin thir things till them, behauld! a certain Ruler cam, and loutit doon afore him, sayin, “My dochter maun eʼen noo be deid! But come and pit thy haun ower her, and she sal leeve!” And Jesus raise and followʼt him; and the disciples as weel. And behauld! a wumman wiʼ an issue oʼ blude twal year, cam ahint him to touch the border oʼ his mantle. For she said till hersel, “Gin I can but touch his mantle, I sal be weel!” But Jesus turned him roonʼ, and whan he saw her, said, “Dochter, tak heart! Yere faith has made ye hale!” And the wumman was made hale frae that ʼoor. And Jesus, comin intil the Rulerʼs hoose, saw the flute‐players, and the folk makin a rowt. He said to them, “Gie place: for the bairn is no deid, but is sleepin!” And they geckʼt at him, and leuch. But whan aʼ the folk war putten oot, he gaed ben; and takin her by the haun, the lassie raise. And the sough oʼt spread abreid in aʼ that kintra‐side. And as Jesus gaed forrit, twa blinʼ men followʼt him, cryinʼ oot and sayin, “Son oʼ Dauvid! hae mercie on us!” And whan he was within the hoose, the blinʼ men cam till him; and Jesus says to them, “Lippen ye that I can do this?” And they say till him, “Aye, Lord!” Than touched he their een, sayin, “Eʼen as yere faith, sae be it dune till ye!” And their een war unsteekit; and Jesus stricklie chairged them, sayin, “See that nae man ken!” But they gaed oot, and spread abreid his fame in aʼ that kintra‐side. And as they gaed oot, behauld! they brocht him a dumb man, wiʼ an evil spirit. And whan the evil spirit was cuisten oot, the dumb spak; and aʼ the folk ferlied, sayin, “Nevir was sic seen in Israʼl!” But the Pharisees said, “He casts oot the demons by the prince oʼ the demons!” And Jesus gaed aboot aʼ the touns and villages, teachin iʼ their kirks, and makin kent the Blythe‐message oʼ the Kingdom, and healin aʼ kinds oʼ sickness, and every ill amang aʼ the folk. But whan he lookit on the thrangs, he was fuʼ oʼ compassion, for they war in distress and war scattered, as sheep wantin a shepherd. Than said he till his disciples “The hairst is maist abundant, but the hairst‐folk are few! “Pray ye to the Maister oʼ the hairst, that he may send oot laborers intil his hairst!” And caʼin his twal disciples till him, he gied them the rule ower unclean spirits, sae as to cast them oot, and to heal aʼ mainner oʼ sickness and fecklessness. Noo the twal Apostlesʼ names are thir: first Simon, wha is named Peter, and Andro his brither; James oʼ Zebedee, and John his brither; Philip, and Bartholomie, Tammas, and Matthew the tax man; James oʼ Alpheus, and Thaddeus; Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, wha eʼen betrayʼt him. Thir twal Jesus sent oot, and chairged them, sayin, “Gang‐na the gate oʼ the Gentiles, and enter‐na ony Samaritan citie; “But gang ye raither to the forwanderin sheep oʼ Israʼlʼs hoose. “And as ye gang, proclaim and say, ‘The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is at haun!’ “The sick heal; the lepers cleanse; the deid raise; ill spirits cast ye oot: freely ye hae gotten; as freely gie! “Get ye nae gowd, nor siller, nor yet copper iʼ yer pouches; “Nae pock for yer journey, nor a spare coat, nor shoon, nor staff: for the worker is wordie oʼ his meat! “And intil whatna citie or toun ye may gae, seek ye oot wha is wordie; and bide ye thar till ye gang awa. “And whan ye come intil a hoose, salute it. “And gin the hoose be wordie, lat yere peace bide upon it; and gin it be no wordie, yere peace wull come back till ye again. “And whasae winna tak ye in, nor hear yere words — whan ye gang oot oʼ that hoose or that toun, flaff aff the vera stour frae yere feet. “Truly say I tʼye, It sal be mair tholeable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day oʼ judgment nor for that citie! “And look! I send ye oot as sheep amang wolves: be ye than wyss like serpents, and aefauld as doos. “But  tak tent oʼ men! for they wull gie ye up to Cooncils, and clour ye iʼ their kirks; “And ye sal be brocht afore Governors and Kings for my sake, for a testimonie to them and to the nations. “But whan they deliver ye up, be‐na fashed aboot hoo or what ye sal say: for in that same ʼoor it sal be gien ye what to say. “For it isna ye wha are speakin, but the Spirit oʼ yere Faither wha speaks in ye. “And brither sal gie up the brither to deid, and the faither the bairn; and the bairns sal rise up again the parents, and hae them putten to deid. “And ye sal be hatit oʼ aʼ folk for the sake oʼ my name; but he wha tholes to the end, that same sal be deliverʼt. “But whan they persecute ye iʼ this toun, flee till anither; for truly say I tʼye, Yeʼse no be ower the cities oʼ Israʼl till whan the Son oʼ Man comes! “The learner is no aboon the teacher, nor a servant aboon the maister. “Eneuch that the learner sud fare as dis the teacher, and the servant like his maister. Gin they caʼ the maister oʼ the hoose Beelzebul, hoo muckle mair them oʼ his househauld? “Be‐na fleyʼt at them than; for thar is naething coverʼt that sanna be uncoverʼt; and hid, that sanna be kent. “What I tell ye iʼ the mirk, tell ye oot iʼ the licht; and what ye hear whushʼt iʼ the lug, proclaim ye on the hoose‐taps! “And dreid‐na them wha slay the body, but canna slay the saul! but raither dreid ye him wha is able to wreck saul and body in hell! “Arena twa sparrows gaun for a bodle? And ane frae mang them faʼs‐na on the grund withoot yere Faither! “But the vera hairs oʼ yere heid are aʼ coontit. “Dinna be dowie, than: ye are better nor mony sparrows! “Whasae sal own me afore men, him sal I own afore my Faither wha is in Heeven. “But whasae disowns me afore men, him sal I disown afore my Faither wha is in Heeven. “Think‐na I am come to cast abreid quateness on the yirth: I come‐na to cast quateness, but a sword. “For I am come to set in dispute a man again his faither, and a bride again her gude‐mither; “And a manʼs faes are they oʼ his ain hoose. “Wha loʼes faither or mither mair nor me, isna wordie oʼ me; and wha loʼes son or dochter mair nor me, isna wordie oʼ me. “And wha taks‐na up his cross, to follow me, isna wordie oʼ me. “He wha wins his life sal tine it; and wha tines his life for my sake, he sal win it! “He wha welcomes you, welcomes me; and he wha welcomes me, welcomes him wha sent me forth. “He wha taks in a seer, in the name oʼ a seer, sal receive a seerʼs reward; and he wha taks in a holie man iʼ the name oʼ a holie man, wins a holie manʼs reward. “And whasae sal gie to drink til ane oʼ thir wee anes a cup oʼ the cauld watir only, iʼ the name oʼ a disciple — truly I say tʼye, he sanna in onygate tine his reward!” And it cam aboot, whan Jesus had endit his commauns to his disciples, he gaed on, to teach iʼ their touns. Noo whan John, iʼ the prison, had heard oʼ the warks oʼ Christ, he sent twa oʼ his disciples, And speirʼt at him, “Are ye He wha comes? Or div we look for some ither ane?” Jesus answerʼt, and says till them, “Gang yere ways; and schaw John aʼ that ye see and hear! “The blinʼ are gettin their sicht, the lameters walk aboot, the lepers are made clean, the deif are hearin, the deid are raised up, the puir and destitute hae the Blythe‐message proclaimʼt till them! “And happy sal he be wha sees nae cause oʼ misdootin in me!” And as they gaed their ways, Jesus begude to speir at the thrangs, anent John, “What gaed ye oot intil the muirlands to see? a reed wafflinʼ iʼ the win? “But what gaed ye oot to see? a man in braw claes! See! they wha wear braw claes are in kingʼs coorts. “But what gaed ye oot for to see? A prophet? Aye! say I tʼye; mair nor a prophet! “For this is he oʼ wham it is written, ‘Tent ye! I send oot my messenger afore thy face, wha sal mak gangable thy fit‐path afore thee!’ “Truly say I tʼye, Amang aʼ thae that are born oʼ weemen, hasna risen ane greater nor John Baptist: yet whasae is wee iʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is  greater nor he! “And frae John Baptistʼs days the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is in the way oʼ bein reived, and the reiverst ak it by main strenʼth! “For aʼ the prophets, and the Law, testifyʼt doon till John. “And, gin ye but accept it, this is ‘Elijah,’ wha was to come! “He wha has hearin to hear, sae lat him hear! “But to what sal I even this race? It is like bairns sittin iʼ the merkit‐place, and cryin oot to their marrows, “And sayin, ‘We played till ye, and ye didna dance; we maenʼd till ye, and ye made nae wail!’ “For John cam, eatin‐na and drinkin‐na, and ye say, ‘He has an evil spirit!’ “The Son oʼ Man cam, eatin anʼ drinkin; and ye say, ‘See! a man gluttonous! a tippler oʼ wine! a freend oʼ tax‐men and ill‐deedie folk!’ But, ‘What comes oʼ Wisdom vindicates her!’ ” Than begude he to challenge thae cities whaur the feck oʼ his great wunner‐warks war dune, for that they repentit‐na: “Wae comes till ye, Chorazin! Wae comes till ye, Bethsaida! for gin in Tyre and Sidon had been dune sic wunner‐warks as were dune in you, they wad hae repentit lang syne in tow‐claith and assis! “But say I tʼye, it sal be mair tholeable for Tyre and Sidon at the day oʼ Judgment nor for you! “And ye, Capernaum! Till Heeven are ye to be raised? Till hell sal ye be dung doon! for gin the warks dune in you had been dune in Sodom, it wad hae been to the fore to this day! “But say I tʼye, It sal be mair tholeable for a Land oʼ Sodom in the day oʼ Judgment nor for you!” At that time Jesus spak, and said: “I gie thee thanks, O Faither, Lord oʼ Heeven and Yirth! that thou did hide thir things frae the wyss and the discernin, and did schaw them till weans! “Aye, Faither! for sae it was gude in thy sicht! “Aʼ things are gien to me oʼ my Faither. And nane weel‐kens the Son but the Faither allenarlie, and nane weel‐kens the Faither but only the Son, and he the Son wull schaw him till. “Come ye to me, aʼ ye wha toil and moil wiʼ heavy burdens, and I wull gie you rest! “Tak my yoke upon ye, and learn ye oʼ me: for I am meek and lown‐heartit, and ye sal finʼ rest tae yer sauls. “For my yoke is cannie; and my burden licht.” At sic a time Jesus gaed on the Sabbath‐day throwe the corn; and his disciples war yap, and begude to tak haud oʼ the heids oʼ the corn, and to eat. But whan the Pharisees sawʼt, quoʼ they till him, “See! yer disciples are doin whatʼs no allooʼd on the Sabbath!” But he answerʼt them, “Hae ye no read what Dauvid did, whan he was hungerʼt, and the anes that were wiʼ him? “Hoo he gaed intil Godʼs Hoose, and did eat the Breid oʼ the Presence, whilk was unlawfuʼ for him to eat — and unlawfuʼ for them wiʼ him to eat — but for the priests allenarlie? “Or hae ye read‐na iʼ the Law, hoo on the Sabbath‐day the priests iʼ the Temple brek the Sabbath, and sin‐na? “But I say tʼye, Thar is Ane here, greater eʼen than the Temple! “But gin ye had kent the meaninʼ oʼ this, ‘I choose mercie rather than sacrifeece, ye wadna hae wytit the guiltless! “For the Son oʼ Man is Lord oʼ the Sabbath!” And he left thar‐awa, and gaed intil the kirk. And see! a man was thar, wiʼ a wizzenʼt haun. And they speirʼt at him, “Is it richt to heal folk on the Sabbath‐day?” that they micht wyte him. And said he to them: “Whatna man is amang ye, wha auchts ae sheep, anʼ ginʼ it faʼ intil a sheugh, wull he no lay haud oʼt, and tak’ it oot? “Hoo muckle mair, than, is a man no worth nor a sheep? And sae, it is weel to do gude on the Sabbath‐day.” Than said he to the man, “Rax oot yere haun!” And he raxʼt it oot; and it was restorʼt, hale and weel, like the ither. Than the Pharisees gaed oot, and counsellʼt thegither, how they micht mak awaʼ wiʼ him. But Jesus, kennin it, withdrew frae that place; and great thrangs followʼt him; and he healʼd them aʼ; Chairgin them that they soudna mak him kent; That it micht come to pass what Esaiah spak, whan he said: “Tent ye, my Servant, my Chosen, my Beloved! My saul is weel‐pleased in him. I wull lay my Spirit on him, and he sal schaw true judgment to the nations. “He sal mak nae tulzie, nor cryin; and nae man sal hear his voice iʼ the streets. “A dentit reed he braks‐na, and the ill‐luntit tow he staps‐na, till true judgment he sends on to victory. “And on his name sal the nations lippen.” Than was brocht till him ane possessʼd wiʼ a demon, blinʼ and dumb: and he healʼd him, sae that the dumb man spak and lookit. And aʼ the folk war astonishʼt: and quoʼ they, “Is this no Dauvidʼs Son?” But whan the Pharisees heard that, quoʼ they, “This ane casts‐na oot demons but throwe Beelzebul, the prince oʼ the demons!” But, kennin their thochts, he said to them, “Ilka Kingdom workin again itsel is brocht to waste; and ilka citie or hoose workin again itsel canna staun? “And gin Sautan cast oot Sautan, he is workin again himsel; hoo than wull he mak his kingdom staun? “And gin I throwe Beelzebul cast oot demons, wha casts them oot by yere ain sons? Sae they sal eʼen be yere judges. “But gin I by the Spirit oʼ God hae cuisten them oot, that the pooer oʼ God has come on ye! “Or, hoo sal ane come intil a strang manʼs hauld, and poind his gear, gin he divna first shackle doon the strang man, and than herrie his hoose? “He wha is isna wiʼ me is again me; and wha gaithers‐na wiʼ me, skails abreid. “Sae, say I tʼye, Ilka sin and blasphemie sal be forgiʼen to men; but the blasphemin oʼ the Spirit sanna be forgiʼen. “And wha sal speak a word again the Son oʼ Man, it sal be forgien till him; but wha sal speak again the Holie Spirit, it sanna be forgiʼen him, naither iʼ this warld, nor in that to come! “Mak aither gude the tree and gude the frute; or els mak ill the tree and ill the frute; for the tree is kent by its frute. “Ye spawn oʼ vipers! hoo are ye, bein ill, to speak gude things? for oʼ the overcome oʼ the heart the mouʼ wull speak. “A gude man, oot oʼ the gude treasur, feshes forth gude things, and an ill man, oot oʼ the ill plenishin, feshes forth ill things. “And I say tʼye, Ilka lowse word that men sal say, they sal gie accoont oʼt at the Day oʼ Judgment! “For by yere words sal ye be acceptit, and by yere words sal ye be hauden guilty.” Than some oʼ the Writers and Pharisees answerʼt, sayin, “Maister, we wad see a token frae thee!” But he answerʼt to them, “An ill‐doin and adulterous race seek for a token; and nae token sal be gien tillʼt, but the token oʼ Jonah the prophet. “For as Jonah was thrie days and thrie nichts iʼ the wame oʼ the sea‐monster, sae sal the Son oʼ Man be iʼ the heart oʼ the yirth thrie days and thrie nichts. “The folk oʼ Nineveh sal rise in judgment wiʼ this race, and condemn it; for they turned at Jonahʼs preachin; and mark! Ane greater nor Jonah is here! “The Queen oʼ the Sooth‐land sal rise up iʼ the Judgment wiʼ this race, and condemn it; for she airtit hersel frae the ends oʼ the yirth to hear Solomonʼs wisdom; and tent ye? Ane greater than Solomon is here! “But the foul spirit, whan it has gane frae the man, gangs oot throwe drouthie pairts, seekin rest, and finʼin nane: “ ‘Than,’ quoʼ he, ‘Iʼse eʼen awa back till my ain hoose, whaur I cam frae!’ And whan he comes, he finds it toom, soopit oot, and buskit braw. “Than gangs awa he, and takin wiʼ him seeven mair, waur nor himsel, enters in and bides thar; and that manʼs last state is  waur nor the first. Sae sal it be wiʼ this ill‐doin race!” And whan he was eʼen‐noo speakin to the folk, see! his mither and his brithers stude oot‐by, seekin to speak wiʼ him. And ane says till him, “See! thy mither and brithers, stauninʼ oot‐by, seekin to speak wiʼ thee!” But quoʼ he till him wha tellʼt him, “Wha is a mither to me? and wha are brithers oʼ mine?” And raxin oot his hauns toward his disciples, he says: “See ye my mither and brithers! “For wha sal do the wull oʼ my Faither Aboon, he is my brither, and sister, and mither!” On that vera day gaed Jesus oot oʼ the hoose, and sat doon by the side oʼ the Loch. And great gaitherins oʼ folk cam thegither till him, sae that he gaed intil a boat, and sat doon; and the hail oʼ the folk stude on the shore. And he spak mony things to them in parables; and quoʼ he: “Tak tent: The sawer gaed oot to saw. “And in his sawin, a neiffuʼ was mis‐cuisten on the fit‐path, and eaten up wiʼ the birdies. “Some fell on the staney bits, whaur the yird was jimp; and it brairdit bonnie, for the mool was thin. “And whan the sun raise heigh, it birslʼt up; and, for that it had nae rute, it dwined awa. “And some fell whaur thorns had been; and up cam the thorns, and smoored it. “And some fell on the gude grunʼ, and brocht forth frute — this a hunner, that saxty, and the ither thretty. “Wha has lugs for hearin, lat him hear!” And, drawin nar, his disciples say, “Why soud ye speak to them in parables?” And he answerʼt them, “It is, that till you it has been gien to ken oʼ the things oʼ the Heevenlie Kingdom: but to them it isna sae gien. “For wha has, to him sal be gien, and he sal hae rowth oʼt; but wha hasna, frae him sal be taen awa eʼen what he has! “Sae, speak I to them by parables: for they, seein, are blinʼ; and they, hearin, are deif; naither div they ken. “And wiʼ them is brocht to pass the prophecy oʼ Esaiah, whilk says: ‘Wiʼ hearin ye sal hear, and in naegate understaun; and seein ye sal see and in naegate perceive. “ ‘For this peopleʼs heart is gross, and their lugs are dull oʼ hearinʼ, and their een hae they steekit; least they soud see wiʼ their een, and hear wiʼ their lugs, and understaun wiʼ their heart, and turn again and I soud heal them!’ “But fair faʼ yere een, that they see! and yere lugs, that they hear! “For truly say I tʼye, that a hantle oʼ prophets and holie men war fain to see the things ye see, and saw them‐na; and to hear the things ye hear, and heard them‐na! “Hear ye than the parable oʼ The Sawer: “Whan ony ane hears the word oʼ the Kingdom, and understauns‐it‐na, than comes the Ill Ane, and cleeks awa that sawn in his heart: this is he sawn by the fit‐path. “And he on the staney bit sawn, is he wha hears the word, and blythely receives it; “Yet has he nae rute in himsel, and bides but for a wee; and on dool or fash comin, he stumbles belyve. “And he sawn amang the thorns, this is he wha hears the word, and than the cark oʼ the warlʼ, and the glamor oʼ riches, smoor the word, and it bears nae frute. “But he sawn on the gude grunʼ, this is he wha baith hears and understauns the word; wha eʼen brings forth frute; and gies, this a hunner, that saxty, and the ither thretty.” Anither parable set he afore them; and quoʼ he: “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to a man, wha sawed gude seed in his croft; “But whan folk war sleepin, cam his fae, and sawed tares amang the wheat, and slippit awa. “But whan the wheat brairdit and brocht forth frute, than schawed the tares as weel. “Sae cam the servants oʼ the gudeman, and quoʼ they to him, ‘Sir, did‐ye‐na saw gude seed iʼ yere croft? Frae whatna way than has it tares?’ “And he said to them, ‘Some enemy has dune this!’ And quoʼ the servants to him, ‘Wull ye hae us gang and gaither them up?’ “But quoʼ he, ‘Na; least as ye gaither up the tares, ye puʼ up the wheat wiʼ them!’ “ ‘Lat baith grow thegither till the hairst; and at hairst‐time I wull say to the shearers, “Gaither ye thegither the tares first, and burn them; but gaither ye the wheat intil my barn.’ ” Anither parable set he afore them, sayinʼ, “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like a mustard‐seed, whilk a man took, and plantit in his yaird. “Whilk in sooth is smaʼest oʼ aʼ seeds, but whan it is grown is the biggest oʼ aʼ yerbs, and comes to be a tree, sae that the birdies oʼ the lift come and howff in its branches.” Anither parable set he afore them: “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like till risin, whilk a wife took and pat in a firlot oʼ meal, till the hail was risen.” Aʼ thae things spak Jesus to the folk in  parables; and wantin a parable spak‐he‐na to them, That it soud come to pass what was said by the prophet, “I will open my mouʼ in parables; I will gie oot things keepit hidin frae the warldʼs fundation.” Than he pairtit frae the thrangs, and gied intil the hoose: and his disciples cam till him, and quoʼ they, “Expone to us the parable oʼ the Tares oʼ the Croft!” He answerʼt, and quoʼ he to them, “He wha sawed the gude seed is the Son oʼ Man. “The croft is the warld; the gude seed are the bairns oʼ the Kingdom; but the tares are the bairns oʼ the Ill Ane. “The enemie that sawed them is Sautan; the hairst is the endin oʼ the warld, and the shearers are the Angels. “And eʼen as the tares are gaitherʼt and burnt iʼ the fire, sae sal it be at the end oʼ the warld. “The Son oʼ Man sal send oot his Angels, and they sal gaither oot oʼ his kingdom aʼ things that ensnare, and aʼ that do ill; “And sal cast them intil the lowin furnace; there sal be maenin and cherkin oʼ teeth! “Than sal the richtous glint forth like the sun, iʼ their Faitherʼs Kingdom. Wha has hearin to hear, lat him hear! “Ance again: The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to gear, hidlins in a field; the same, when a man has fund, he hides again, and for the joy oʼt gangs and niffersʼ aʼ that he has, and buys that field. “Again, the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to a tradin‐man, seekin precious pearls: “Wha, whan he has fund ae pearl oʼ aʼ price, gaed and sellʼt aʼ he had, and coft it. “Again, the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like a net cuisten intil the sea, and it gaitherʼt oʼ aʼ kinds: “Whilk, when it was fuʼ, they harlʼt tae the shore, and they sut them doon and waled oot the gude intil creels, but cuist the bad awa. “Sae sal it be at the end oʼ the warld: the Angels sal come forrit and wale oot the wicked frae amang the gude; “And sal cast them into the lowin furnace: there sal he maenin and cherkin oʼ teeth!” And quoʼ Jesus to them: “Hae ye understude aʼ thir things?” Quoʼ they till him: “Aye, Lord!” Than said he to them, “Ilka scribe wiʼ the lear oʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven, is like till ane that is heid oʼ a hoose, wha can fesh oot oʼ his presses things baith new and auld.” And it cam aboot, that whan Jesus had made an end oʼ his parables, he gaed frae that place. And whan he was come intil his ain kintra‐side, he was teachin them iʼ their ain kirk, sae that they war astonishʼt, and quoʼ they: “Whaur gat this man this wisdom, and thir ferlies? “Isna this the wrichtʼs son? And isna his mother caʼd ‘Mary’? And his brithers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judah? “And his sisters, arena they aʼ wiʼ us? Frae whaurawa, than, has this man thir things?” And they took a scunner at him. But Jesus said to them: “A Prophet is nevir wantin honour, binna it be in his ain kintra‐side, and amang his ain folk.” And he wrocht na mony wunner‐warks thar, because oʼ their unbelievin. Aboot that time Herod, the King‐Depute, heard aʼ that was said aboot Jesus. And quoʼ he to them oʼ his hoosehauld, “This maun be John the Baptist; he is risen frae the deid; and sae div thir pooers schaw theirsels in him.” For Herod had grippit John, and putten him in bonds; and cuist him intil prison for the sake oʼ Herodias, wife oʼ his brither Philip. For John said till him: “It is no allooʼd for ye to hae her!” And whan he wad hae putten him to deid, he was fleyʼt oʼ the people, for they reckonʼd him a Prophet. But whan Herodʼs birthday cam, the daughter oʼ Herodias danced in the mids oʼ them aʼ, and glamorʼd Herod. Whauron, he sware to gie her onything she micht speir. And she, bein set on by her mither, said: “Gie me here John Baptistʼs heid, on an aschet!” And the king was wae; but for the sake oʼ his aiths, and for thae that sat at meat wiʼ him, he commandit it to be gien to her. And he sent, and beheidit John iʼ the prison. And his heid was brocht on an aschet, and gien to the lass; and she brocht it till her mither. And his disciples cam, and took up the body, and buryʼt it; and gaed and tellʼt Jesus. And whan Jesus heard it, he gaed awa by boat till a desert‐place oot‐by; and whan the croods heard oʼt, they followʼt on fit frae the toons. And he cam oot, and saw a great thrang; and he had pitie on them and healed their sick anes. And whan the eʼenin cam on, his disciples cam till him, and quoʼ they, “This is but a desert bit, and the time is gaun by; send the folk awa, that they may gang to the neebor toons, and buy theirsels meat!” But Jesus said to them, “They need‐na gang awa; gie ye them to eat!” Quoʼ they to him, “We hae here but fyve bannocks and twa fish.” He said, “Fesh them here to me!” And he garʼt the crood sit doon on the gerss; and took the fyve bannocks and the twa speldrins, and lookin up till Heeven he gied thanks, and brak, and gied the bannocks to the disciples, and the disciples to the folk. And they aʼ did eat, and war satisfyʼt; and they liftit oʼ the broken bits that war left,  twal baskets fuʼ. And they wha had eaten war aboot fyve thoosand men, forby weemen and weans. And at ance he garʼt his disciples gang intil the boat, and gang awa first to the ither side, till he wad send the crood awa. And whan he had sent the crood awa, he gaed up intil a mountain by his‐sel to pray; and whan eʼenin fell he was thar alane. But the boat was noo iʼ the mids oʼ the Loch, vexʼd wiʼ the waves: for the wund was contrar. And iʼ the hinmaist watch oʼ the nicht Jesus cam to them, gangin on the sea. And whan the disciples saw him walkin on the sea, they war sair gliffʼt, saying, “It is a ghaist!” And they cryʼt oot for fear. And at ance Jesus spak to them, “Be oʼ gude heart! It is I; fear‐na!” And Peter answerʼt and quoʼ he, “Lord, gin it be thou, bid me come till thee on the watir!” And he said, “Come!” And whan Peter was gotten doon oot oʼ the boat, he walkit on the watir to gang tae Jesus. But whan he saw the wund gousty, he fearʼt; and as he begude to sink he cryʼt oot, “Lord, save me!” And at ance Jesus raxed oot his haun, and grippit him, saying to him, “O thou oʼ sic smaʼ faith, why did thou fear?” And whan they war gane up intil the boat, the wund was lown. And they iʼ the boat worshippʼt him, saying, “Truly thou art the Son oʼ God!” And whan they gat ower, they cam to the land, to Gennesaret. And whan the men oʼ that place had kennin oʼ him, they sent oot intil aʼ the kintra‐side, and feshʼt till him aʼ that war ailin; And entreatit him that they micht but touch the border oʼ his garment; and aʼ that touched were made hale. Than cam Writers and Pharisees oʼ Jerusalem to Jesus; and quoʼ they, “Hoo isʼt yere disciples mind‐na the biddins oʼ the faithers oʼ auld? For they eat breid wiʼ unweshin hauns.” But he answerʼt them, and quoʼ he, “Hoo isʼt that ye too gang contrar to Godʼs commaun wiʼ yere biddens? “For God commandit, ‘Honor faither and mither,’ and, ‘Wha bans faither or mither, lat him dee!’ “But ye say, ‘Wha says till his faither or his mither, It is aʼ  devotit, ocht that ye micht hae by me; “ ‘He sal do nocht to mainteen his faither or his mither.’ Sae hae ye brocht Godʼs commaun to nocht by yere biddens. “Ye fause anes! Esaiah weel foretellʼt oʼ you, sayin, “ ‘This folk come nar me wiʼ their mouʼ, and gie me honor wiʼ their lips, but their heart is far awa! “ ‘But aʼ in vain worship they me, layin down for rules the biddens oʼ men.’ ” And he caʼd till him the folk, and quoʼ he to them, “Hear ye, and understaun! “It isna what gangs intil the mooth that fyles the man; but what comes oot oʼ the mooth that fyles the man!” Than cam his disciples, and quoʼ they, “Kennʼst thou the Pharisees war ill‐pleased, whan they heard yon sayin?” But he said, “Ilka plant no oʼ my Heevenlie Faitherʼs plantin, sal be uprutit. “Lat abee! theyʼre but blinʼ leaders oʼ the blinʼ! And gin the sichtless airt the sichtless, baith sal faʼ intil the sheugh.” Than up‐spak Peter, and quoʼ he, “Expone to us the parable!” And Jesus says, “Are ye eʼen yet wantin knowledge? “Div ye no ken, that whateʼer may gang in at the mooth, finʼs its way intil the paunch, and is cuisten oot intil the sewer? “But thae things whilk come frae the mooth, come oot frae the heart, and they fyle the man! “For frae the heart come oot ill‐thochts, bludeshed, adulteries, lecherie, thievin, fause‐sweerin, blasphemies; “Thir things fyle a man; but to eat wiʼ hauns unpurifyʼt fyles‐na a man!” And Jesus gaed thence, and cam to the pairts oʼ Tyre and Sidon. And see! a Canaanite wumman cam oot frae thae pairts, and cryʼt oot till him; and quoʼ she, “Hae pitie on me, O Lord, thou Son oʼ Dauvid! my dochter is sair vexʼt wiʼ a demon!” But he answerʼt her no a word. And his disciples cam and entreatit him, and quoʼ they, “Send her awa, for she skreighs eftir us!” But he answerʼt, and said, “I wasna sent, but to the forwanderin sheep oʼ Israʼlʼs hoose!” And she cam nar, and worshippʼt him, sayin, “Lord! help me!” But quoʼ he, “It isna bonnie to tak bairnsʼ breid, and to cast it to the dowgs!” And she said, “Even sae, Lord! yet the vera dowgs eat oʼ the mools faʼin frae the maisterʼs buird!” Than answerʼt Jesus till her, “Eh, wumman! yere faith is great! Lat it be till ye as ye wull!” And her dochter was made hale frae that ʼoor. And Jesus gaed awa frae that place, and came nar to the Loch oʼ Galilee; and gaed up intil a mountain, and sut him doon. And great croods oʼ folk cam to him, haein wiʼ them lameters, sichtless, dumb, maimed, and mony mair; and laid them doon at Jesusʼ feet; and he healed them. Sae that the folk ferlied uncolie, to behauld the dumb speakin, the maimed hale, the lameters to gang, and the blinʼ seein; and they glorifyʼt the God oʼ Israʼl. Than Jesus caʼd his disciples to him, and quoʼ he, “I hae pitie on the folk, for that they hae been wiʼ me noo thrie days, and hae nae meat; and I winna send them awa, least they soud swarf iʼ the gate.” And the disciples said to him, “In whatna way coud we hae sae muckle breid iʼ the wilderness, as to fill sae great a crood oʼ folk?” Jesus says to them, “Hoo mony bannocks hae ye?” And they said, “Seeven; and a wheen wee speldrins.” And he commandit the folk to sit doon on the grunʼ. And he took the seeven bannocks, and the fish, and gied thanks; and he brak, and gied to the disciples, and they to aʼ the folk. And they did aʼ eat, and war filled; and they gaitherʼt up oʼ the broken meat left, seeven creels fuʼ. And they wha did eat war fowr thoosanʼ men, forby weemen and bairns. And he sent the folk awa; and gaed intil a boat, and cam to the pairts oʼ Magadan. And the Pharisees and the Sadducees cam, and in a twafauld way speirʼt at him, “Gin he wadna schaw them a token frae Heeven?” He answerʼt, and quoʼ he, “Whan it is eʼenin ye say, ‘Fair wather; for the sky is reid!’ “And iʼ the mornin, ‘Broken wather the day, for the sky is reid and lowerin!’ Ye ken hoo to judge the scaum oʼ the sky; — can ye no the signs oʼ the times? “An ill‐deedie and adulterous race seek eftir some sign; and nae sign sal be giʼen tillʼt but the sign oʼ Jonah.” And he gaed aff frae them. And the disciples cam to the ither side, and forgat to tak breid. And Jesus said to them, “Tak tent, and troke ye‐na wiʼ the barm oʼ the Pharisees and Sadducees!” And they spak ane till anither, sayin, “We took nae breid!” And Jesus, kennin it, said, “O ye oʼ the smaʼ faith, why soud ye reason amang yersels for that ye hae nae breid? “Dae ye no ken, dae ye no mind, the fyve bannocks oʼ the fyve thoosanʼ: and hoo mony baskets ye gaitherʼt? “Naither the seeven bannocks oʼ the fowr thoosanʼ, and hoo mony creels ye gaitherʼt? “Hoo isʼt ye dinna ken I spak to‐ye‐na anent breid; but to tak tent and beware oʼ the teachins oʼ the Pharisees and the Sadducees!” Than saw they hoo he bad them no beware oʼ the barm oʼ the breid, but oʼ the doctrines oʼ the Pharisees and Sadducees. Whan Jesus had come intil the kintra‐side oʼ Philipʼs Cesarea, he speirʼt at his disciples, “Wha dae folk say the Son oʼ Man is?” And quoʼ they, “Some, John the Baptist; and some, Elijah; and ithers, Jeremiah, or ane oʼ the Prophets.” He says to them, “But wha say ye that I am?” And Simon Peter spak, and quoʼ he, “Thou art the Anointit Ane, the Son oʼ the Leevin God!” And Jesus answerin, says till him, “Happy are ye, Simon, son oʼ John! for nae flesh and blude tellʼt it tʼye, but my Faither iʼ the Heevens. “And I say tʼye, ye are a Rockman; and on this Rock wull I bigg my kirk; and the yetts oʼ Hell sal nevir owercome it! “And I wull gie tʼye the keys oʼ Heevenʼs Kingdom; and what ye sal bind on the yirth sal be bund in Heeven; and what ye sal lowse on the yirth sal be lowsed in Heeven.” Than chairged he the disciples no to tell ony man he was the Anointit Ane. Frae that time forrit Jesus begude to schaw till his disciples, hoo that he bude gang to Jerusalem, and dree mony things oʼ the Elders and Heid‐priests and Writers; and be slain; and on the third day be waukened again. Than Peter took him aside, repruvin him; and quoʼ he, “Hae mercy on thyselʼ! this sal nevir be thy faʼ!” But he turned him aboot, and quoʼ he to Peter, “Ahint me, Sautan! ye are but a snare to me! for ye seek‐na the things oʼ God, but the things oʼ men!” Than quoʼ Jesus to his disciples, “Gin ony man wad come eftir me, lat him deny his sel, and tak up his cross, and follow me. “For whasae wad save his life sal tine it; and whasae wull tine his life for my sake, sal win it. “For what is a man the better, thoʼ he win the hail warld, and tine his ain saul? or what sal a man gie as caʼtion for his saul? “For the Son oʼ Man comes in the glorie oʼ his Faither, wiʼ the Angels; and than sal he gie every man accordin as his wark sal be. “Truly say I tʼye, thar are thae staunin here, wha sal in naegate pree death, till they hae seen the Son oʼ Man  comin in his Kingdom!” And sax days eftir, Jesus taks Peter, and James, and his brither John, and brings them up intil a heigh mountain by their sels: And was transfigurʼt afore them; and his face beamed like the sun, and his cleedin glintit as the licht. And look! thar was seen by them Moses and Elijah, speakin wiʼ him. Than answerʼt Peter, and quoʼ he to Jesus, “Lord! it is guid for us to be here! Gin thou wull, lat us mak here thrie bothies — for thee ane, and for Moses ane, and for Elijah ane.” Whiles he was speakin, lo! a clud oʼ brichtness cam ower them; and a voice cam oot oʼ the clud, sayin, “This is my Son! the Beloved, wham I delicht in! Hear ye till him!” And whan the disciples heard, they fell on their faces, fearin uncolie. And Jesus cam nar, and touched them, and said, “Rise, and be‐na fleyʼt!” And liftin up their een, they saw nane, but Jesus alane. And comin doon frae the mountain, Jesus chairged them, “Schaw ye the vision tae nae man, until the Son oʼ Man rise frae mang the deid!” And his disciples speirʼt at him, “Hoo than dae the Writers say, ‘Elijah maun first come’?” And he answerʼt them, “Elijah dis come, and redd aʼ things. “But say I, Elijah is come already, and they kent him na; but did till him as they desirʼt. Eʼen sae sal the Son oʼ Man dree oʼ them!” Than the disciples begude to see that he spak to them oʼ John the Baptist. And whan they war come till aʼ the folk, thar cam till him a man, loutin doon on his knees, and sayin, “Lord, hae mercie on my son; for he is sair dementit, and unco hauden; for aft he faʼs intil the fire, and aft intil the watir: “And I feshed him tae thy disciples; and they coudna heal him.” And Jesus said, “O race, thrawart and wantin faith? hoo lang sal I be wʼye? hoo lang sal I thole ye? Bring him here to me!” Than did Jesus challenge the demon, and he gaed forth oot oʼ him; and the laddie was made hale frae that ʼoor. And than the disciples cam to Jesus, aʼ by their sels, and quoʼ they, “Why wasʼt we couldna cast him oot?” And he says to them, “For that ye want faith: for truly say I tʼye, gin aiblins ye had faith eʼen as a pickle oʼ mustard‐seed, ye sal say till this mountain, ‘Flit ye to yon place!’ and it sal flit; and nocht sal be ayont yere pooer. “But this kind gangs‐na oot, but in prayer and fastin.” And while they bade in Galilee, Jesus says to them, “The Son oʼ Man sal be giean up, intil menʼs hauns. “And they wull slay him; and the third day he wull rise again.” And they war uncolie grieved. And whan they cam to Capernaum, they that took in the Hauf‐shekel, cam nar to Peter, and quoʼ they, “Yere Maister — dis he no pay the  Hauf‐shekel?” Quoʼ he, “Aye!” And whan he cam intil the hoose, Jesus spak first, and quoʼ he, “What dae ye think, Simon? Frae wham dae kings oʼ the yirth tak toll and tribute? frae their ain folk, or frae fremd folk?” Peter says to him, “Frae fremd folk.” Quoʼ Jesus to him, “Than their ain folk are free! “But that we gar‐them‐na stummle, gang ye till the Loch; and cast in a heuk, and tak the first fish comin up; and openin its mouʼ, ye sal find a shekel. Tak it, and gie to them for me and you.” Iʼ that ʼoor cam the disciples till Jesus, and quoʼ they, “Wha is boonmaist iʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven?” And he caʼd till him a bairn, and set him iʼ the mids oʼ them, And quoʼ he, “Gin ye turn‐na, and come to be like a bairn, ye enter‐na intil the Kingdom oʼ Heeven. “Whasae than sal mak his sel naething, as this wee bairn, the same is heigher iʼ the Kingdom oʼ Heeven. “And whasae taks till him ae sic wee bairn iʼ my name, taks me till him. “But whasae sal mak to faʼ ane aʼ thae wee things that lippen tae me, it had been better for him to hae a mill‐stane hung aboot his neck, and he sunk iʼ the deeps oʼ the sea. “Wae to the warld for snares oʼ stummlin! For snares wull come; but wae to the man by wham the snares come. “And sae, gin yere haun or fit ensnare ye, sned it aff, and cast it awa; it is gude for ye to enter intil life hirplin or maimʼd, raither than wiʼ twa hauns or feet to be cuisten intil nevir‐endin lowe! “And gin yere ee ensnare ye, oot wiʼt, and cast it awa; it is gude for ye to enter intil life wiʼ ae ee, raither than wiʼ twa een to be cuisten intil hell‐fire! “Tak tent that ye lichtlie‐na ane oʼ thir wee anes; for say I tʼye, that in Heeven their ain Angels aye look upon my Heevenlie Faitherʼs face! “For the Son oʼ Man has come to save thae that war lost. “Noo, hoo think ye, yersels? Gin a man hae a hunner sheep, and ane oʼ them is gane awa, dis he no leaʼ the ninety‐and‐nine, and gang intil the mountains, seekin the ane forwanderʼt? “And gin sae be that he lichts onʼt, truly say I tʼye, he is blyther ower that sheep than ower the ninety‐and‐nine that gaed‐na awa. “Eʼen sae, thar is nae desire afore yere Faither in Heeven that ane oʼ thir wee anes soud be lost. “And gin yere brither‐man sin again ye, gang to him, and schaw him his faut atween you and him alane: gin he harken to ye, ye hae won yere brither‐man. “But gin he winna harken to ye, than tak wiʼ ye ane or twa mair, sae that at the mooth oʼ twa or thrie witnesses, ilk word may be  made siccar. “And gin aiblins he winna hear them, tell it to the kirk; and gin he winna hear the kirk, than lat him be to ye as a fremʼd ane, or ane oʼ the tax‐men. “Truly say I tʼye, whatsoeʼer ye bind fast on the yirth, sal be bunʼ fast in Heeven; and what ye lowse on yirth sal be lowsed in Heeven. “And ance mair say I tʼye, that gin twa oʼ ye mak it up on the yirth what ye sal ask for, it sal be dune for them by my Faither in Heeven. “For whaur the twa or the thrie are forgatherʼt iʼ my name, thar am I iʼ the midsʼ oʼ them.” Than Peter comes forrit till him, and quoʼ he, “Lord, hoo aft may my brither‐man sin again me, and I maun forgie him? Seeven times?” Jesus said to him, “I say tʼye, No till seeven times, but seeventy times and seeven! “And sae is the Kingdom oʼ Heeven like to a certain king wha wad hae a reckonin wiʼ his servants. “And whan he had begude to reckon, ane was brocht till him wha was awn him ten thoosanʼ talents. “And haein nocht to pay, his maister orderʼt him to be sellʼt, and his wife, and weans, and aʼ that he had; and payment to be made. “The servant than fell doon and worshippʼt him, cryin, ‘Lord, thole ye wiʼ me, and I wull pay ye aʼ!’ “Than, moved wiʼ pitie, that servantʼs lord lowsed him, and forgae him the debt. “And that same servant, gaun oot, fand ane oʼ his fellow‐servants wha was awn him a hunner pennies; and he laid haud oʼ him, and grippit him by the hauss, cryin, ‘Pay me what ye are awn!’ “And his fellow‐servant fell doon at his feet, and besocht him: ‘Thole ye wiʼ me, and I wull pay ye aʼ!’ “And he wadna, but gaed and had him cuisten intil prison, till he soud pay what was awn. “Sae whan his fellow‐servants saw what was dune, they war unco wae, and cam and tellʼt their maister aʼ that was dune. “Than his lord caʼd for him, and quoʼ he to him, ‘O, ye ill‐deedie servant! I forgae ye aʼ that debt, for that ye did beseech me: “ ‘Soud‐ye‐na had rewth on yere fellow‐servant, eʼen as I had mercie on you?’ “And his lord was sair angerʼt, and gied him ower to the officers, till he soud pay aʼ that was awn to him. “Eʼen sae sal my Heevenlie Faither do to you, gin ye forgie‐na ilk ane his brither‐man frae yere hearts!” And it cam aboot, that whan Jesus had made an end oʼ thae words, he quat Galilee, and cam intil the pairts oʼ Judea ayont Jordan. And great croods followʼt him; and he healed them thar. And Pharisees cam to him, way?-?layin him, and sayin, “Isʼt lawfuʼ for a man to pit awa his wife, for ony cause ava?” And he answerʼt, and quoʼ he to them, “Hae‐ye‐na read hoo he wha made them at the beginnin, made them male and female. “And said, ‘For this wull a man leaʼ his faither and his mither, and be joined to his wife, and they twa sal be ae flesh!’ “Sae that they are nae mair twa, but ae flesh. And sae what God has joined thegither, lat‐na man pit sindry!” They say to him, “Hoo than did Moses commaun to gie her a writin oʼ divorcement, and to pit awa?” He says to them, “Moses, for the hardness oʼ yere hearts, tholed that ye sould pit awa yere wives; but frae the beginnin it wasna sae. “And I say to ye, that whasae sal pit awa his wife, let‐abee for adultery, and sal wed anither, commits adultery; and wha weds the divorced wumman commits adultery.” His disciples say to him, “Gin it be sae wiʼ a man and his wife, it isna gude to mairry!” But he said to them, “Aʼ cannaʼ tak in this sayin; but only thae to wham it is gien. “For thar are some eunuchs frae their mitherʼs womb; and thar are some sae, made eunuchs by men; and thar are some that hae made theirsel sae for the Kingdom oʼ Heevenʼs sake. Wha has strenʼth to tak it in, lat him tak it in!” Than war brocht till him wee bairns, that he soud pit hauns on them, and gie them his blessin: and the disciples challenged them. But Jesus said, “Lat the wee bairns come to me, and dinna forbid them; for sic anes mak up the Kingdom oʼ Heeven!” And he pat his hauns on them; and gaed awa. And see! ane cam till him, and quoʼ he, “Maister! Whatna gude thing sal I dae, that I may win Eternal Life?” And he says to him, “Why div ye speir aboot that whilk is gude? Ane thar is wha is gude; that is God! But gin ye wad enter intil Life, keep the Commaunments.” He speirʼt at him, “Whilk?” And Jesus said to him, “ ‘Ye sanna kill; ye sanna commit adultery; ye sanna bear fause‐witness; “ ‘Honor yere faither and yere mither; and ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yersel!’ ” The lad says, “Aʼ thir I keep! What want I yet?” Jesus says to him, “Gin ye wad be perfete, gang and sell  aʼ ye hae, and gie it oot to the puir; and ye sal hae gear laid up in Heeven; and come, follow me!” But whan the young man heard that sayin, he gaed awa dowie; for he had great estates. And Jesus said till his disciples, “It is no an easy thing for a man oʼ muckle gear to enter the Kingdom oʼ Heeven! “Aye, say I tʼye, it is easier for a camel to threid a needleʼs ee, than ane rich to enter the Kingdom oʼ Heeven!” Whan the disciples heard it thev ferlied uncolie; and quoʼ they, “Wha than can be savʼt?” And Jesus, dwallin on them wiʼ his een, said, “Wiʼ men, this wad be impossible; but no wiʼ God. For wiʼ God, aʼ things can be possible!” Peter answerʼt, and quoʼ he, “We hae left aʼ to follow thee; what sal we hae, than?” And Jesus said to them, “In the Aʼ‐Things‐New, whan the Son oʼ Man sal sit on the thron oʼ his glorie, ye as weel sal sit on twalʼ throns, ower the Twalʼ Tribes oʼ Israʼl. “And ilka ane forsakin hooses, or brethren, or sisters, or faither or mither, or bairns, or mailin, for my nameʼs sake — sal hae a hunner‐fauld, and sal inherit Life Eternal! “But mony first sal be hin maist; and hinmaist first. “For the Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like till a man, a laird, wha gaed oot iʼ the dawin, to hire workers intil his vine‐yaird. “And whan he had ʼgreeʼt wiʼ the laborers for a hauf‐merk a day, he sent them intil his vine‐yaird. “And he gaed oot aboot the chap oʼ nine, and saw ither anes staunin idle iʼ the merkit. “And quoʼ he to them, ‘Gang ye as weel intil the vine‐yaird, and whateʼer is richt, ye sal hae!’ And they gaed their ways. “And again he gaed oot aboot twalʼ, and thrie oʼclock, and did the same. “And at fyve he gaed oot, and faund mair staunin; and, quoʼ he, ‘Hoo isʼt ye staun here, idle aʼ the day?’ “They say, ‘For that nae man feeʼd us!’ He says to them, ‘Gang ye as weel intil the vine‐yaird; and whateʼer is richt, that sal ye hae!’ “Sae whan gloamin was come, the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird says to his grieve, ‘Caʼ the workers; and gie them their fee; beginnin frae the hinmaist doon to the first.’ “And whan they oʼ fyve oʼclock cam, they gat ilk man a hauf‐merk. “And whan the first cam, they trowʼd to hae gotten mair; and they, as weel, gat ilka man a hauf‐merk. “And whan they gat it, they yammerʼt again the gudeman, “Saying, ‘Thir last anes hae putten‐in ae ʼoor, and ye hae made them even wiʼ us, wha hae dreed the weary cark and scouther oʼ the day!’ “But he answerʼt ane oʼ them, and quoʼ he, ‘Freend, I do ye nae wrang! Did‐ye‐na tak‐on wiʼ me for a hauf‐merk? “ ‘Tak what belangs tʼye, and gang yere gate! It is my wull to gie to this last eʼen as to you. “ ‘Isʼt no richt to hae my ain wull in my ain things? Is your ee skellied because I am upricht?’ “Sae the hinmaist sal be first, and the first hinmaist. For mony are bidden, but no aʼ acceptit.” And as Jesus was gaun up to Jerusalem, he took aside the twalʼ disciples, and on the way said to them, “Noo, we gang up to Jerusalem, and the Son oʼ Man sal be betrayʼt to the Heid‐Priests and the Writers, and they sal doom him to death; “And sal set him ower to the heathen to mock, and to clour, and to crucify; and on the third day he sal rise again.” Than cam till him the mither oʼ Zebedeeʼs sons, wiʼ her sons, worshippin him, and seeking a thing frae him. And he says to her, “What wad ye?” Quoʼ she till him, “Commaun that thir my twa sons may sit, the ane on thy richt haun, and the ither on thy left haun, iʼ thy Kingdom!” But Jesus answerʼt and said, “Ye kenna what ye seek! Are ye fit to drink oʼ the cup I am to drink oʼ?” They say till him, “We are fit!” He says to them, “Ye sal truly drink my cup; but to sit on my richt haun and on my left haun, isna mine to gie, but to thae my Faither has preparʼt it for.” And the Ten, hearin it, war unco angry again the twa brithers. But Jesus caʼd them till him, and said, “Ye aʼ ken hoo the rulers oʼ the nations lord it ower  the folk, and their great anes exerceese authoritie amang them; “But sae it sanna be amang you; but whasae wad be heigh amang ye, lat him be yere servitor; “And whasae wad be first amang ye, lat him be yere thirlman. “Eʼen as the Son oʼ Man cam‐na to be serʼt, but to serʼ; and to gie up his life a ransom for mony.” And whan they gaed on frae Jericho, a great crood followʼt him. And lo! twa blinʼ men, sittin by the wayside, whaneʼer they kent that Jesus gaed by, cryʼt out, “Lord, hae mercie on us, thou Son oʼ Dauvid!” And the folk challenged them, that they soud haud their whisht. But they skreighʼt oot the mair, “Lord, hae mercie on us, thou Son oʼ Dauvid!” And, comin till a staun, Jesus caʼd them; and said, “What isʼt ye wad hae me do for ye?” They say till him, “Lord, that oor een micht be unsteekit!” And Jesus, led wiʼ compassion, touched their een; and at ance they wan their sicht; and they followʼt him. And whan they wan nar Jerusalem, and war come till Bethphage, at the Mount oʼ Olives, Jesus sent forrit twa oʼ his disciples. Sayin to them, “Gang yere ways to the toun fornent ye, and ye sal finʼ at ance an ass tetherʼt, and a cowt wiʼ her; lowse them, and lead them to me. “And gin ony ane challenge ye, say, ‘The Lord has need oʼ them;’ and at ance they wull send them.” Noo this was sae, that it soud be fulfilled that was said by the prophet: “Tell ye Zionʼs dochter. Tak tent! thy King comes to thee, lowly, and ridin on an ass; and a cowt, the foal oʼ a toilin ass.” And the disciples, doin as Jesus appointit them, Feshʼd the ass and the cowt, and they laid on their mantles; and he sat thar‐on. And a hantle oʼ the thrang spread their mantles iʼ the way; ithers cuttit branches frae the trees, and strinkled them iʼ the way. And aʼ the folk that gaed on afore, and they that cam ahint, cryʼt, sayin, “Hosanna to the Son oʼ Dauvid! Blessed is he comin iʼ the name oʼ the Lord! Hosanna iʼ the heighest Heevens!” And whan he was come tae Jerusalem, aʼ the citie was putten aboot, speirin, “Wha is this?” And aʼ the folk said, “This is Jesus the Prophet — frae Nazareth oʼ Galilee!” And Jesus gaed intil the Temple, and drave oot aʼ that sellʼt and bocht iʼ the Temple, and whammlʼt ower the tables oʼ the nifferers oʼ siller, and the binks oʼ thae that sellʼt doos. And said to them, “It is putten‐doon, ‘My Hoose sal be caʼd a Hoose oʼ Prayer,’ but ye mak’ it a howff oʼ robbers!” And there cam till him iʼ the Temple the blinʼ and the lameters; and he healed them. But whan the Heid‐Priests and the Writers saw the ferlies that he did, and the bairns cryin oot iʼ the Temple, and sayinʼ “Hosanna to the Son oʼ Dauvid!” they war sair vexed; And quoʼ they till him, “Hear‐ye‐na what thir anes say?” And Jesus says to them, “Aye! And hae‐ye‐na read, ‘Oot oʼ bairnsʼ and sucklinsʼ mouʼs hast thou ordeenʼt thy praise!’ ” And he left them, and gaed oot oʼ the city to Bethanie, and lodged the nicht thar. And comin back early tae the city he hungerʼt. And seein a fig‐tree by the way, he cam tillʼt and fund naething onʼt but leaves; and quoʼ he, “Lat thar be nae frute oʼ thee frae this forrit, for evir!” And belyve, the fig‐tree dwined awa! And whan the disciples saw it, they ferlied uncolie, sayin, “Hoo sune did the fig‐tree dwine awa!” And Jesus answerʼt, and said to them, “Truly say I tʼye, Gin ye hae faith, ye mayna only do as is dune to the fig‐tree, but aiblins ye may say to this mountain, ‘Flit thou, and faʼ intil the sea!’ it sal be dune. “And ye sal winʼ aʼ things — whatsoeʼer ye ask in prayer, believin.” And whan he was come intil the Temple, the Heid‐Priests and the Elders oʼ the people cam till him as he was teachin, and quoʼ they, “By whatna authoritie div ye do thir things? And wha gied ye this authoritie?” And, answerin, Jesus said to them, “I wull ask you ae quaisten as weel; and gin ye answer me, I wull tell ye by whatna authoritie I do thir things. “The bapteezin oʼ John  — whaur cam it frae? Frae Heeven? or oʼ men!” And they counsellʼt amang theirsels, sayin, “Gin we say, ‘Frae Heeven,’ he wull say to us, ‘Why, than, dinna ye believe him?’ “But gin we say, ‘Frae men,’ we are fleyʼt oʼ the people; for they aʼ haud John as a Prophet.” And they answerʼt Jesus, and said, “We canna tell.” And than he, too, says to them, “And naither div I tell you by what authoritie I do thir things! “But hoo div ye judge noo? A man had twa sons; and he cam to the first ane, and quoʼ he, ‘Son, gang and work, the day, in my vine‐yaird!’ “He, answerin, said, ‘I winna!’ but eftir, he bethocht him, and gaed. “And he cam to the second, and said the like; and he answerʼt, and quoʼ he, ‘I — aye, Sir!’ and gaed‐na. “Whilk oʼ thae twa did his faitherʼs wull?” They say till him, “The first ane.” Jesus says to them, “Truly say I tʼye, that the tax‐men and the harlots gang intil the Kingdom oʼ Heeven afore ye! “For John cam to ye, schawin richtousness; and ye wadna believe him. And ye, seein it aʼ, didna eʼen repent eftirhaun, that ye micht lippen till him. “Hear ye anither parable: Thar was a laird wha plantit a vine‐yaird, and dykit it roond aboot, and howkit a wine‐vat inʼt, and biggit a tooer, and lat it oot to crofters, and gaed awa till anither land. “And whan the time oʼ frutinʼ drew nar, he sent his servants to the crofters to receive his frutes. “And the crofters took his servants, and they cloured ane, and slew anither, and staned anither. “And again, he sent ither servants, mair in number than the first anes; and they did to them the same. “But eftir, he sent to them his son, sayin, ‘They will honour my son.’ “The crofters, howbeit, seein the son, said amang theirsels, ‘This is the heir! Come, let us slay him, and tak his inheritance.’ “And they took him, and cuist him oot the vine‐yaird, and killed him. “Whan, tharfor, the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird sal come, what wull he do to thae crofters?” They say to him, “Unco destruction sal he bring on thae wicked men; and wull lat oot the vine‐yaird to ither crofters, wha wull render him the frutes iʼ their seasons!” Jesus says to them, “Did ye nevir read iʼ the word, ‘The stane rejeckit oʼ the masons, the same was made the heid oʼ the corner. Frae the Lord was this: and an unco ferlie in oor eʼen!’ “Tharfor say I tʼye, The Kingdom oʼ God sal be taʼen awa frae ye, and gien till a nation bringin forth the frutes oʼt. “And wha faʼs on this stane sal be sairly cloured; but on wham it may faʼ, it wull grind him to poother!” And the Heid‐Priests and Pharisees, hearing his parables, jaloused that he spak oʼ them. But whan they socht to grip him, they fearʼt the crood; for they did haud him as a Prophet. And answerinʼ, Jesus spak to them again in parables; and quoʼ he: “The Kingdom oʼ Heeven is like to a King, wha made a Bridal‐feast for his son. “And sent oot his servin‐men to tell them wha had a bode; and they wadna come. “And he sent oot mair servants; and quoʼ he, ‘Tell them that are bidden, See! I hae gotten ready my denner; my owsen and my fed things are killed, and aʼ is ready. Come tae the Bridal‐feast.’ “But they geckʼt at it, and gaed their gate, ane to his ain mailin, and anither to his wares. “And the lave grippit his servin‐men, and ill‐treatit them, and slew them. “And the King was sair angerʼt; and he sent oot his airmies and destroyed thae men‐slayers, and brunt their toon. “Than said the King, ‘The Bridal‐feast is aʼ ready, but they bidden warna wordie; “Gang ye tharfor to the pairtin oʼ the ways; and aʼ, eʼen as mony as ye finʼ, caʼ to the feast!’ “And thae servants gaed oot intil the heigh‐roads, and gatherʼt thegither aʼ, eʼen as mony as they faund, baith ill and weel faurʼd; and the bridal had its guests. “But the King,  comin ben to see the guests, spied a man wantin a waddin garment. “And speirs at him, ‘Freend! hoo cam ye here, wantin a waddin‐garment?’ and he had nocht to say. “Than said the King to his servants, ‘Bind him haun‐and‐fit, and cast him oot intil the deid‐mirk; thar wull be greetin and cherkin oʼ teeth!’ “For a hantle are bidden: but only a wheen waled oot.” Then gaed the Pharisees, and counsellʼt thegither hoo they micht fank him in his talk. And they sent their disciples to him, wiʼ them oʼ Herodʼs pairty, and quoʼ they, “Maister! we ken ye are leal and true, and teach Godʼs ways truly, and swither for nae man; for ye look‐na on the person oʼ men:— “Tell us than what think ye? Isʼt weel to gie dues to Cesar, or no?” But Jesus, takin tent oʼ their wickedness, said to them, “Why fausely deal wiʼ me, ye hypocrites? “Schaw me the siller for the dues!” And they brocht to him a siller penny. And he says to them, “Whase is this heid, and this inscription?” They say to him, “Cesarʼs.” Than says he to them, “Gie to Cesar Cesarʼs things; and to God Godʼs things!” And whan they heard, they ferlied uncolie; and leaʼin him, gaed their gate. That vera day cam till him the Sadducees, wha say thar is nae Risin‐again, and they speirʼt at him:— “Maister, Moses said, ‘Gin a man soud dee, leaʼin nae bairn, his brither sal mairry his wife, and rear up seed till his brither.’ “Noo thar war wiʼ us seeven brithers; and the first eftir mairryin, deeʼt; and haein nae bairn, left his wife to his brither. “In like mainner the second, and the third, eʼen to the seeventh. “And eftir them aʼ, the wife deeʼt. “At the Great Risin, than, whase wife sal she be oʼ the seeven? for they aʼ had her?” Jesus answerʼt them, and quoʼ he: “Ye are aʼ wrang! for ye ken naither the Scripturs nor the pooer oʼ God! “For in the Risin‐again, they naither wed nor are gien in wedlock; but are as the Angels in Heeven. “But, anent the Risin‐oʼ‐the Deid, hae ye no read what God spak tʼye, sayin: “ ‘I am the God oʼ Abraʼm; and Isaacʼs God, and Jaucobʼs God!’ He isna the God oʼ  deid men, but leevin!” And aʼ the folk, hearin it, ferlied muckle at his teachin. But the Pharisees, whan they heard he had putten the Sadducees to silence, forgatherʼt; And ane frae mang them speirʼt at him a quaisten, testin him, and sayin, “Maister! whilk is the great commaun oʼ the Law?” Jesus says till him, “ ‘Ye sal loʼe the Lord yere God wiʼ yere hail heart, and wiʼ yere hail saul, and wiʼ yere hail mind!’ “This is the great and first commaun. “And a second ane is like tillʼt; ‘Ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yersel.’ “On thir twa commauns hing aʼ the Law and the Prophets.” Noo, while the Pharisees war gaitherʼt thegither, Jesus speirʼt at them: “What think ye aboot the Anointit Ane? Whase Son is he?” They say to him, “Dauvidʼs son.” He said to them, “Hoo than dis Dauvid caʼ him ‘Lord?’ sayin, “ ‘Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit thou on my richt haun, till I mak thy faes thy fit‐brod.’ “Seeing Dauvid caʼs him ‘Lord,’ hoo is he his son?” And nae man was fit to answer him a word: naither, frae that day forrit daur ony man to speir at him ony mair quaistens. Than spak Jesus to aʼ the folk, and till his disciples: “The Writers and the Pharisees are sutten doon in Mosesʼ seat. “Aʼ things tharfor they bid ye do, observe them. But follow‐na eftir their warks: for they say, and do‐na. “And they bind heavy burdens, and lay them on the shouthers oʼ men; but they winna move them wiʼ ae fingʼer. “For they mak braid their amulets and enlairge their tassels, “And seek for the first seats at feasts, and heid places iʼ the kirks, “And courtesie iʼ the merkits, and to be caʼd ‘Maister! Maister!’ oʼ men. “But be‐na ye caʼd ‘Maister;’ for ye hae ae Maister, Christ; and aʼ ye are brethren. “And caʼ nae man ‘Faither,’ on the yirth; for Ane is yere Faither — the Heevenlie. “Nor be ye caʼd ‘Leaders;’ for Ane is yere Leader, Christ. “But the ane wha is greatest amang ye sal be the ane that serʼs. “And whasae sal mak himsel heigh, sal be puʼd doon; and whasae sal abase himsel sal be upliftit. “But wae for ye, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye steek up the Kingdom oʼ Heeven afore men wha wad gang in; ye naither gang in yersels, nor alloo them to gang in wha wad! “Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye devoor weedowsʼ hooses, eʼen while ye are makin lang prayers: sae sal ye hae the wechtier judgment! “Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye gang ower yirth and sea to bring in ae disciple; and whan he is sae become, ye mak him twafauld mair a son oʼ hell than yersels! “Wae for you, ye blinʼ leaders! whilk say, ‘Wha sal sweer by the Temple, it is nocht; but wha sweers by the Templeʼs gowd, he is hauden!’ “O fules and blinʼ! Whilk is greater, the gowd, or the Temple that hallows the gowd? “And, ‘Wha sweers by the offeran‐stane, it is nocht; but wha sweers by the offeran onʼt, he is hauden!’ “O blinʼ! For whilk is mair, the offeran, or the Altar‐stane that hallows the offeran? “Wha, tharfor, sweers by the offeran‐stane, sweers by it, and by aʼ things onʼt. “And wha sweers by the Temple, sweers by it, and by Him that dwalls within. “And wha sweers by Heeven, sweers by Godʼs thron, and by Him wha sits tharon. “Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye tithe mint, and dill, and cummin; and pit awa the wechtier things oʼ the Law, justice, mercie and faith. Thir ye behoved to do — no leavin the ither undune. “Ye blinʼ leaders! Ye seil oot the midge, and ower wiʼ the caumel! “Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders; for ye dicht the ootside oʼ the cup and the dish, but within they are fuʼ oʼ reivin and riot! “O blinʼ Pharisee! mak clean first the inside oʼ the cup and the dish, that the ootside oʼt may be made clean as weel! “Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye are like whited tombs, whilk look bonnie outside, but within are fuʼ oʼ deid menʼs banes, and aʼ uncleanness. “Eʼen sae, ye hae the ootward seemin oʼ being holie men, but within ye are fuʼ oʼ fauseness and sin. “Wae for you, Scribes and Pharisees, pretenders! for ye bigg the tombs oʼ the Prophets, and busk the graffs oʼ the gude. “And say, ‘Gif we had but been iʼ the days oʼ oor faithers, we wadna hae been ane wiʼ them anent the blude oʼ the Prophets!’ “Sae ye are witnesses to yersels, that ye are bairns oʼ thae wha killed the Prophets. “And you! fill ye up the measur oʼ yere faithers! “Serpents! offspring oʼ vipers! hoo are ye to escape the judgment oʼ hell? “Tharfor, see! I send ye Prophets, and Wyss Men, and Scribes: some oʼ them wull ye slay and crucify, and some clour iʼ yere kirks, and persecute them frae toon tae toon: “That on ye may faʼ aʼ the holie blude shed on the earth, frae the blude oʼ Abel the richtous, to the blude of Zechariah, son oʼ Barachiah, that ye slew atween the Temple and the altar. “Truly say I tʼye, aʼ thir things sal come on this race! “Eh, Jerusalem! Jerusalem! wha slays the prophets and stanes the messengers sent to her!  Hoo aft and fain would I hae gaitherʼt thy bairns thegither, like as a hen gaithers her cleckin aneath her wings! — and ye wadna. “See! yere hoose and hauld is left aʼ desolate tʼye! “For say I tʼye, ye see me nae mair frae this forrit, till whansaeʼer ye may say, ‘Blessed is he, cominʼ iʼ the name oʼ the Lord!’ ” And Jesus gaed oot frae the Temple, and was gangin his ways; and his disciples cam to airt him to look at the biggins oʼ the Temple. But he answerʼt tae them, “See‐ye‐na thae things? Truly say I tʼye, thar sal‐na remain here ae stane on anither that sanna be cuisten doon!” And as he  sat on the Mount oʼ Olives, his disciples cam till him by theirsels, and quoʼ they, “Tell us whan div thae things come? And what is the sign oʼ thy comin? and oʼ the hinner‐end oʼ the warld?” And Jesus answerʼt and quoʼ he, “Tak tent that nae man mistryst ye! “For mony sal come in my name, sayin, ‘I am the Anointit Ane!’ and sal lead mony a‐gley. “And ye sal hear oʼ weir, and aʼ the clash oʼ weir; but be‐na fleyt; for aʼ thae things maun come, but the end oʼ aʼ isna yet. “For nation sal rise again nation, and kingdom again kingdom; and thar wull be dearth, and yirdins, in a hantle places; “Noo, aʼ thir things schaw the oncome oʼ travail. “Than sal they gie ye up to dool, and sal slay you; and ye sal be hatit oʼ aʼ folk for the sake oʼ me. “Than sal mony stoiter; and they sal gie ane anither up, and sal hate ane anither. “And mony fause prophets sal rise, and lead mony a‐gley. “And, sin owerflowin, the love oʼ mony sal grow cauld. “But wha tholes to the hinner end sal be saved. “And thir Gude‐tidins oʼ the Kingdom sal be preached in aʼ the warld for a testimonie to the nations; and then sal the end come. “Whan, than, ye see the abomination that ruins aʼ, spoken oʼ by Daniel the Prophet, staunin iʼ the Holie Place (wha reads, lat him tak tent!) “Than thae that are in Judea, lat them hie to the mountains! “Lat him that is on the hoose‐tap no gang doon to tak ony oʼ his plenishin oot oʼ the hoose! “Nor lat him wha is in the croft, rin back to grip his mantle. “But wae for thae that are mithers to‐be! and for thae that gie sook iʼ thae days! “And pray that yere flittin be‐na iʼ the winter, or on the Sabbath! “For thar sal be dolor and dool, sic as nevir has been sinʼ the warld begude, till noo; na, nor evir sal be mair! “And but for that thae days hae been shortened, nae flesh soud hae been saved; but for the sake oʼ the waled‐oot, the days are shortened. “Than, gin ony man say tʼye, ‘See! here is the Anointit Ane!’ or ‘yonner!’ heed‐him‐na! “For thar sal rise fause Christs, and fause prophets, and they sal schaw unco signs and ferlies; sae as to lead awa, gin it war possible, eʼen the waled‐oot theirsels. “See! I hae tellʼt ye aforehaun! “Sae, gin they say tʼye, ‘See! he is in the desert!’ gang‐na oot; ‘Tak tent! he is ben iʼ the chaummer!’ believe‐it‐na! “For as the fire‐flaucht glints iʼ the East, and flares eʼen to the Wast, sae sal the comin oʼ the Son oʼ Man be. “Whaureʼer the carcase is, thar wull the kites be gaitherʼt thegither! “But incontinent eftir  the dool oʼ thae days, sal the sun be putten oot, and the mune sanna gie her licht, and the starns sal faʼ frae their places, and the pooers oʼ the heevens sal be cuisten doon. “And thar sal be displayʼd abreid the token oʼ the Son oʼ Man in Heeven; and than sal aʼ the tribes oʼ the yirth maen; and they sal see the Son oʼ Man come in the cluds oʼ Heeven, wiʼ unco pooer and glorie. “And he wull send oot his Angels wiʼ an unco blast oʼ a trumpet, and they sal gaither thegither his chosen frae the fowr wunds, frae ae far‐awa end oʼ Heeven to the ither. “Noo, frae the fig‐tree tak her lesson! Whan her young sprigs are tender, and the leaves are comin, ye ken simmer is nar; “And sae eʼen ye, whan ye see aʼ thir things, ken that it is nar‐haun, eʼen at yere doors. “Truly say I tʼye, this generation sanna pass awa, till aʼ thir things are dune! “Heeven and yirth may pass awa, but my words sanna pass awa! “But, anent yon day and ʼoor, nane kens — no eʼen the Angels in Heeven — but my Faither alane. “For eʼen as it was in Noahʼs days, sae sal be the comin oʼ the Son oʼ Man. “For as iʼ thae days afore the Flude, they war feastin and drinkin, marryin and giean in wedlock, to the vera day Noah gaed intil the ark, “And kent na till the Flude cam, and soopit them aʼ awa; sae sal be the comin oʼ the Son oʼ Man. “Than, twa sal be in the field; ane sal be taen, and the tither left. “Twa sal be grindin at the mill; ane is taen, and the tither left. “Tak gude tent tharfor! for ye ken‐na on what day yere Lord comes! “But tak ye tent oʼ this: that gin the gudeman had kent whan the reiver wad come, he wadna hae had his hoose howkit throwe! “Sae be ye aye ready! for ye ken‐na but at some ʼoor ye think‐na, the Son oʼ Man comes! “Wha than is the wyss and leal servant, wham his maister has putten ower his hoosehauld, to gie them their providin at due times? “Weel is the servant, wham his lord, whan he comes hame, sal finʼ sae doin. “Truly say I tʼye, he wull set him ower aʼ his haddin. “But, gin that ill servant sal say within his sel, ‘My lord is lang in comin!’ “And sal begin to clour his fellow‐servants, and to feast and drink wiʼ the drucken, “The maister oʼ that servant sal come in a day he looks‐na for him, and at an ʼoor he kens‐na, “And sal smite him through; and his faʼ sal be wiʼ aʼ the fause anes: thar sal be greetin and cherkin oʼ teeth. “Than sal the Kingdom oʼ Heeven be like to ten maidens, takin ilk ane her ain crusie, and gaun oot to meet the bridegroom. “And fyve oʼ them war unco witless, and fyve war wyss. “For the witless took nae ulyie wiʼ them whan they took their crusies; “But the wyss took ulyie iʼ their pouries, wiʼ their lamps. “Noo, while the bridegroom cam‐na, they aʼ grew sleeperie, and dozed. “But at midnicht cam a shout, ‘Hey, the Bridegroom comes! C’way and meet him!’ “Than raise aʼ thae maidens, and fettled up their crusies. “And the witless said to the wyss, ‘Gie us oʼ yere ulyie; for oor lamps are gaun oot.’ “But the wyss answerʼt, and quoʼ they, ‘Aiblins thar wadna be eneuch for us and you; but raither gang ye to thae that sell, and seek for yersels.’ “And while they war aff, trokin, the Bridegroom cam; and they that war ready gaed in wiʼ him till the marriage‐feast; and the door was steekit. “Then belvye cam the ither maidens, sayin, ‘My lord, my lord, open to us!’ “But he answerʼt, and quoʼ he, ‘Truly say I tʼye, I dinna ken ye!’ “Sae, tak ye tent! for ye ken‐na the day nor the ʼoor! “For it is juist like a man gaun till anither lanʼ, wha caʼd till him his servants, and gied ower to them his gear. “And to ane he gied fyve talents, to anither twa, and anither ane; to ilka ane accordin to his ain ability; and than he gaed on his journey. “Than he that had gotten the fyve talents, gaed and trokit and nifferʼt wiʼ the same, and made fyve talents oʼ increase. “And likewise the ane oʼ the twa talents, he gained twa mair. “But he that gat the ane, gaed awa and howkit iʼ the grunʼ, and hid awa his maisterʼs siller. “And, lang eftir, the maister oʼ thae servants comes; and has a reckonin wiʼ them. “And he that had gotten the fyve talents gien him, cam and said, ‘My lord! ye gied me five talents; see, I hae gotten fyve talents forby!’ “His maister says to him, ‘Weel dune, gude and leal servant! ye hae been leal and true ower a wee wheen things; I wull gie ye chairge ower a hantle oʼ things. Enter ye intil the joy oʼ yere lord!’ “Likewise he oʼ the twa talents cam forrit, and quoʼ he, ‘My lord! ye gied me twa talents; see, I hae gotten twa ither talents!’ “His lord said, ‘Weel dune, gude and leal servant! Ye hae been leal and true ower a wee wheen things; I wull gie ye chairge ower a hantle oʼ things. Enter ye intil the joy oʼ yere lord!’ “He, too, wha had gotten the ae talent, cam; and quoʼ he, ‘My lord! I kent ye war a siccar man, shearin whar ye sawʼd‐na, and gaitherin whar ye cuist‐na breid; “ ‘And I was fleyʼt, and gaed awa, and hid yere talent iʼ the grunʼ. See! ye hae yere ain!’ “But his lord answerʼt him, and quoʼ he, ‘Wicked and feckless servant! did ye indeed ken that I shear whaur I saw‐na, and gaither whaur I cast‐na breid? “ ‘War ye no behauden than to gie ower my siller to the bankers? and at my hame‐comin I soud hae gotten back my ain, wiʼ interest. “ ‘Tak, then, the talent frae him; and gie it to him that has the ten talents! “ ‘For to ilk ane wha has, sal be gien, and he sal hae rowth; but frae him wha wants sal be taen awa eʼen what he has! “ ‘And cast ye the ungainfuʼ servant intil the ooter mirk; thar sal be greetin and cherkin oʼ teeth.’ “But whan the Son oʼ Man sal come in his glorie, and aʼ the angels wiʼ him, than sal he sit on the thron oʼ his glorie. “And aʼ the nations sal be gaitherʼt afore him; and he wull pairt them ane frae anither, juist as a herd pairts the sheep frae the goats. “And he wull pit the sheep on his richt haun, but the goats on the left. “Then wull the King say to them on his richt haun, ‘Come ye, aʼ blessed oʼ my Faither! Inherit the Kingdom made ready for ye frae the up‐biggin oʼ the warld! “ ‘For I was hungerʼt, and ye gied me meat; I was drouthie, and ye gied me drink; I was a fremd ane, and ye took me in; “ ‘Strippit was I, and ye cled me; I was ill, and ye socht me oot; I was in thrall, and ye cam till me!’ “Then wull the richtous say to him, ‘Lord! whan saw we thee hungerʼt, and gied meat? or drouthie, and gied drink? “ ‘Or whan saw we thee a fremd ane, and took thee in? Or strippit, and clad thee? “ ‘Or whan saw we thee ill, and in thrall, and cam to thee?’ “Then sal he answer them, sayin, ‘Truly say I tʼye, in‐as‐muckle as ye did it to ane oʼ thae my brethren, eʼen they least anes, ye did it to me!’ “Then, eke, sal he say to them on his left haun, ‘Awa frae me, ye curst, intil nevir‐endin lowe, made ready for the deevil and his angels! “ ‘For I was hungerʼt, and ye gied me nae meat; I was drouthie, and ye gied me nae drink; “ ‘I was a fremd ane, and ye took‐me‐na in; strippit, and ye didna cleed me; ill, and in thrall, and ye socht‐me‐na!’ “Then, eke, wull they answer, sayin, ‘Lord! whan saw we thee hungerʼt, or drouthie, or fremd, or strippit, or ill, or in thrall, and didna serʼ thee?’ “Then wull he answer them, sayin, ‘In‐as‐muckle as ye did‐it‐na till ane oʼ thir least anes, ye did‐it‐na to me!’ “And thir sal gang awa intil nevir‐endin pyne; but the richtous intil nevir‐endin life. And sae it cam to pass, that whan Jesus had made an end oʼ thae sayins, he said to his disciples: “Ye ken that twa days mair, and the Pasche comes; and the Son oʼ Man is deliverʼt up to be crucifyʼt.” Than forgatherʼt the Heid‐priests and the Elders oʼ the nation intil the palace oʼ the Heigh‐priest — the ane caʼd Caiaphas. And coonsellʼt thegither that they might tak Jesus hidlins, and slay him. “But,” quoʼ they, “no at the Feast‐time; or thar wad be a stramash amang the people.” Noo, whan Jesus was in Bethanie, iʼ the hoose oʼ Simon the leper, Thar cam till him a wumman wiʼ an alabaster box oʼ unco precious perfume; and she teemed it on his heid as he was at meat. And the disciples, seein it, war put aboot, and quoʼ they, “For what is siccan a wastrie? “For this micht hae been sellʼt for muckle, and gien to the puir.” But Jesus, takin tent, says to them, “Why fash ye the wumman? For a wark that is bonnie has she wrocht on me. “For ye aye hae the puir wʼye; but ye hae‐na me aye! “For she, strinklin this perfume on my heid, did it for my burial. “Truly say I tʼye, whaursoeʼer thir Gude‐tidins sal be made kent iʼ the hail warld, this too oʼ what she has dune sal be tellʼt for a memorial oʼ her.” Than ane oʼ the Twal, the ane caʼd Judas Iscariot, gaed awa to the Heid‐priests, And quoʼ he tae them, “What meed wull ye gie me, and I wull deliver him up tʼye?” And they trokit wiʼ him for thretty merks. And frae that time forrit he watched for a time to betray him. Noo on the first oʼ the days oʼ the Sad Breid, the disciples cam to Jesus, askin him, “Whaur wull ye that we wull mak ready for ye to eat the Pasche?” And he says, “Gang awa intil the citie, tae sic and sic a  man, and speir at him, ‘The Maister says, My time is comin; I keep the Pasche at yere hoose wiʼ my disciples!’ ” And the disciples did eʼen as Jesus tellʼt them; and they made ready for the Pasche. Noo whan the eʼenin was come, he sat doon at meat wiʼ the Twalʼ. And whiles they war eatin, he said, “Truly say I tʼye, that ane oʼ ye wull betray me!” And they were unco wae, and begude to say to him, ilk ane oʼ them, “Is it I, Lord?” And he said, “He wha dippit his haun wiʼ me in the dish, that ane wull betray me! “The Son oʼ Man gangs, as it was written oʼ him; but wae to that man by wham the Son oʼ Man was deliverʼt up! It war gude for yon man gin he nevir had been born!” And Judas, wha betrayʼt him, spak, and quoʼ he, “Isʼt I, Maister?” He says till him, “Eʼen as ye say!” And as they war eatin, Jesus took the laif, and gied thanks, and brak it, and gied to the disciples, sayin, “Tak, eat; this is my body!” And takin a cup, and giean thanks, he gied it to them, sayin, “Drink ye aʼ oʼt! “For this is my blude oʼ the New Covenant, whilk is shed for mony, for the pittin‐awa oʼ sins! “But I say till ye, I drink nae mair forrit oʼ this frute oʼ the vine, till yon day whan I drink it new wiʼ you iʼ my Faitherʼs Kingdom!” And whan they had sung praise, they gaed oot intil the Mount oʼ Olives. Than says Jesus till them, “Aʼ ye sal finʼ cause oʼ stumblin in me this nicht; for it is putten‐doon, ‘I wull clour the Shepherd; and the sheep oʼ his hirsel sal be scatterʼt abreid!’ “But eftir my Risin, I wull gang afore ye intil Galilee.” Peter answerin, says to him, “Gin aʼ soud stumble in thee, yet nevir wad I stumble!” Jesus says to him, “Truly say I tʼye, that this vera nicht, ʼor ever the cock craw, ye sal thrice disown me!” Peter threepit to him, “Gin I soud dee wiʼ thee, yet wull I no disown thee!” And siclike said aʼ the disciples. Than cam Jesus wiʼ them intil a place caʼd Gethsemanie; and says to the disciples, “Sit ye here, till I gang yonner and pray.” And takin wiʼ him Peter and Zebedeeʼs twa sons, he grew unco fuʼ oʼ sorrow, and sair putten‐aboot. Than says he to them, “My saul is unco sorrowfuʼ, eʼen to death! Bide ye here, and watch wiʼ me!” And he gaed on a wee bit yont, and fell on his face, and prayed, sayin, “O my Faither! gin it be possible, lat  this cup pass by me! yet, no as I wull, but as Thou wult!” And he comes till the disciples, and finʼs them sleepin; and quoʼ he to Peter, “Eʼen sae! Coud‐ye‐na watch wiʼ me ae ʼoor? “Tak ye tent, and pray, gin ye faʼ‐na intil temptation! The spirit is indeed wullin, but the flesh is waff!” Again a second time he gaed aff, and prayed, sayin, “O my Faither! gin this canna gang by me unless I drink it, Thy wull be dune!” And, comin again, he faund them sleepin; for their een had wan heavisome. And he left them again, and gaed awa, and prayed a third time, sayin the same words. And he comes till his disciples; and says he tae them, “Sleepin are ye noo, and takin yere rest? Tent ye! the ʼoor is at haun; and the Son oʼ Man is deliverʼt intil the hauns oʼ evil men! “Rise ye, and lat us be gaun! See, he is at haun wha betrays me!” And eʼen while he yet spak, look! Judas, ane oʼ the Twalʼ, cam, and wiʼ him a great thrang, wiʼ swords, and rungs, frae the Heid‐priests, and elders oʼ the nation. And he wha betrayed him, had gien them a sign, and quoʼ he, “Wha I sall kiss, that same is he; grip him!” And at ance he cam to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Maister!” wiʼ unco kissin. And Jesus said to him, “Freend, for what did ye come?” Than cam they, and pat their hauns on Jesus, and grippit him. And see! ane oʼ them that war wiʼ Jesus, raxʼt oot his haun, and drew a sword, and strack a servant oʼ the Heigh‐priest, and sned aff his lug. Than said Jesus to him, “Pit up yere blade intil its place; for aʼ they wha tak oot the sword, by the sword sal dee! “Think‐ye‐na that I coud pray my Faither, and he soud send me mair nor twalʼ legions oʼ Angels? “But hoo than coud the Scripturs be fulfilled that sae it soud be?” In that ʼoor said Jesus to the thrang, “Cam ye oot as again a robber, wiʼ swords and rungs to tak me? I sat day by day, teachin in the Temple, and ye grippit‐me‐na.” But aʼ this was dune, that the writins oʼ the Prophets soud come to pass. Than aʼ his disciples desertit him, and fled. And they wha had taen Jesus led him awa till Caiaphas, the Heigh‐priest, whaur the Scribes and the Elders war forgatherʼt. But Peter followʼt far ahint, to the Heigh‐priestʼs palace; and gaed in, and sat wiʼ the servants, to see the end. Noo the Heid‐priests and the hail Cooncil socht fause witnesses again Jesus, that they micht pit him to deid; But faund‐them‐na, thoʼ a hantle cam forrit as witnesses. At last cam twa, And said, “This Ane said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple oʼ God, and up‐bigg it in thrie days!’ ” And the Heigh‐priest raise, and quoʼ he, “Answer‐ye‐na! What isʼt that thir are witnessin again ye?” But Jesus was silent. And the Heigh‐priest said, “I adjure ye by the Leevin God, that ye tell us gin ye be The Anointit, the Son oʼ God?” Jesus says to him, “Ye hae said it! Natheless, I say tʼye, here‐eftir sal ye see the Son oʼ Man seatit at the richt haun oʼ pooer, and cominʼ iʼ the cluds oʼ Heeven!” Than did the Heigh‐priest rive his garments, and quoʼ he, “He has spoken profanely! What need hae we oʼ mair witnesses? Tent ye! ye hae noo heard his profane speech! “Hoo dis it seem to ye?” They answerʼt and said, “He is wordie oʼ death!” Than they spat in his face, and baffʼt him; and ithers strack him wiʼ the loof, Sayin, “Prophesie tae us, thou Anointit Ane! Wha wasʼt that clourʼd thee?” Noo, Peter was sittin oot‐by iʼ the coort‐yaird: and a maid cam till him, sayin, “Ye war wiʼ Jesus oʼ Galilee!” But he denyʼt fornent them aʼ; threepin, “I ken‐na what yeʼre sayin!” And whan he was gane oot intil the porch, anither lassie saw him, and says to them that war thar, “This ane, too, was wiʼ Jesus, the Nazarene!” And again he denyʼt wiʼ an aith, “I ken‐na the man!” And eftir a wee, they that stude by cam and said to Peter, “Oʼ a sooth ye are ane oʼ them; for yere tongue tells on ye!” Than begude he to curse and ban, “I ken‐na the man!” And at ance the cock crew. And Peter caʼd to mind the word Jesus spak, “Afore the cock craw, ye wull thrice disown me!” And he gaed oot, and grat sair. Whan mornin was come, aʼ the Heid‐priests and Elders oʼ the nation coonsellʼt thegither again Jesus to compass his death. And they bund him, and led him awa to Pilate the Governor. Than Judas, that betrayʼt him, whan he saw he was condemned, repentit sair, and took back the thretty merks to the Heid‐priests and Elders, Sayin, “I hae sinned, in deliverin up innocent blude!” But quoʼ they, “What isʼt to us? See ye tillʼt yersel!” And he cuist doon the siller iʼ the Temple, and gaed awa; and gangin oot, he hangʼt himsel. And the Heid‐priests liftit the siller, and said, “It isna fit to gang iʼ the Treasury, seein it is the price oʼ blude!” And, takin advice onʼt, they coft wiʼt the pottersʼ‐grund, to bury fremd anes in. Sae that grund was caʼd “The Bluidy Field,” to this day. Than cam to pass what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, “And they took the thretty merks, the price oʼ him that had a price set on him, wha was priced amang Israʼlʼs sons; “And gied them for the potterʼs yaird; as the Lord appointit me.” And Jesus stude fornent the Governor. And the Governor speirʼt at him, “Are ye the King oʼ the Jews?” And Jesus said to him, “Ye hae said it.” And bein accused oʼ the Heid‐priests and Elders, he answert nocht. Than said Pilate to him, “Hear‐ye‐na hoo mony things they threep again ye?” And he answerʼt him no sae muckle as a word; sae that the Governor ferlied uncolie. Noo, aye at the Feast, the Governor had lowsed to them ae prisoner, sic ane as they wad. And they had, at that time, a noted prisoner, caʼd Barabbas. Sae when they had forgatherʼt, Pilate speirʼt at them, “Wham wad ye that I lowse? Barabbas, or Jesus that is caʼd Christ?” For he kent that for mere ill‐will they had deliverʼt him up. And as he was on the Judgment‐seat, his  wife sent till him, sayin, “Hae ye nocht to do wiʼ yon just man! for I hae dreeʼt mony things this day in a dream, on his accoont.” Noo the Heid‐priests and the Elders perswadit aʼ the folk that they soud ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. And the Governor said to them, “Whilk wull ye, oʼ the twa, that I soud release ye?” Quoʼ they, “Barabbas!” Pilate says to them, “Than what sal I do wiʼ Jesus, wha is caʼd Christ?” They aʼ say, “Lat him be crucifyʼt!” And he said, “Why sae? What ill has he dune?” But they cryʼt oot fierce and lang, “Lat him be crucifyʼt!” Sae Pilate, seein he prevailʼt‐na, but that raither a tulzie was risin, had watir, and weshʼt his hauns afore aʼ the folk, sayin, “I am innocent oʼ the blude oʼ this richtous man! See ye tillʼt!” And aʼ the folk answerʼt, “His blude be on us, and on oor bairns!” Than lowsed he Barabbas; but Jesus he lashʼt, and deliverʼt him to be crucifyʼt. Than the sodgers oʼ the Governor, takin Jesus wiʼ them intil the Judgment‐haʼ, gaitherʼt thegither the hail core: And they strippit him, and pat on him a scarlet manteel. And they wove a croon oʼ thorns, and pat it on his heid, and a reed in his richt haun; and they loutit doon afore him, and geckʼt at him, sayin, “Hail, King oʼ the Jews!” And they spat upon him, and baffʼt him ower the heid wiʼ the reed. And whan they had mockʼt him, they took aff the manteel frae him, and pat on his ain cleedin, and led him awa to be crucifyʼt. And, comin oot, they lichtit on a man oʼ Cyrene, caʼd Simon; him they pressʼd, to cairry the cross. And whan they war come till a place caʼd Golgotha, that is to say, “Skull‐place,” They offerʼt him wine wiʼ gaʼ inʼt; and whan he had preeʼd, he wadna drink. And whan they had crucifyʼt him, they pairtit his cleedin amang theirsels, castin the lot; And they sat doon and watchʼt him thar: And pat up ower his heid his accusation, “This is Jesus, King oʼ the Jews.” Than war twa reivers crucifyʼt wiʼ him, ane on the richt haun, and ane on the left. And the passers‐by miscaʼd him, waggin their heids, And sayin, “Ye that ding doon the Temple, and up‐bigg it in thrie days, save yersel! Gin ye be Godʼs Son, come doon frae the cross!” And eʼen the Heid‐priests too, and the Scribes and Elders, said, “Ithers he savʼt: his ain sel he canna save! Israʼlʼs King he is! lat him, eʼen noo, come doon frae the cross, and we wull lippen on him! “He lippenʼd on God: lat him, noo, rescue him, gin he cares ocht for him! for he said, ‘I am Godʼs Son!’ ” And eʼen the reivers that war crucifyʼt wiʼ him, cuist the same reproach at him. Noo, frae the ʼoor oʼ twalʼ, thar was black mirk ower aʼ the kintra, to the ʼoor oʼ thrie. And aboot the ʼoor oʼ thrie, Jesus cryʼt oot wiʼ a great voice, sayin, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani!” that is, “My God! My God! for why did Thou forsake me?” And some oʼ them staunin thar, said, “He was caʼin for Elijah!” And at ance, ane oʼ them ran, and took a sponge, fillin it wiʼ vinegar, and pat it on a reed, and gied him to drink. But the lave said, “Haud awa, lat us see gin Elijah comes to rescue him!” And Jesus cried oot again wiʼ a great voice, and gied up his spirit. And look! The Temple‐veil was riven in twa, frae tap to bottom, and the grund trimmlʼt and the rocks war cleft; And the tombs war openʼt; and a hantel oʼ the bodies oʼ the saunts wha had faun asleep, raise; And comin oot oʼ their tombs eftir his Risin‐again, they cam intil the holie city, and schawed theirsels to mony. And the officer, and they that war watchin Jesus, whan they saw the yirth trimmle, and the things that war dune, war uncolie fleyʼt, sayin, “Truly, this was Godʼs Son!” Noo, mony weemen war there, lookin on frae far‐awa, wha had followʼt Jesus frae Galilee, providin for him. And amang them, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mither oʼ James and Joses, and the mither oʼ Zebedeeʼs sons. And when the gloamin cam on, a rich man frae Arimathea cam, caʼd Joseph; wha himsel was a disciple oʼ Jesus. This yin, gaun to Pilate, askit for the body oʼ Jesus. Than Pilate commandit it soud be gien up. And Joseph, whan he had taen the body, rowʼt it in a fair linen claith, And laid in his ain new tomb, whilk he had howkit oot iʼ the rock, and he rowʼt a great stane tae the door oʼ the tomb; and gaed awa. And Mary the Magdalene was thar, and the ither Mary, sittin ower fornent the tomb. Noo the neist day — the day eftir the “Preparation” — the Heid‐priests and the Pharisees gaitherʼt thegither to Pilate, sayin to him, “Sir, we mind weel that yon deceiver said whan he was yet leevin, ‘Eftir thrie days I wull arise!’ “Gie commaun, thar‐for, that the tomb be made sure and siccar till the third day; sae that his disciples come‐na and steal him awa, and say to aʼ folk that ‘He is risen frae the deid!’ sae the last deception wad be waur nor the first!” Pilate said, “Yeʼse hae a gaird; gang yere ways, and make it as siccar as ye may!” Sae they gaed, and made the tomb safe, sealin the stane, and settin a gaird. And at the hinner‐end oʼ the Sabbath, as it begude to break to the first day oʼ the week, cam Mary the Magdalene, and the ither Mary, to see the tomb. And see! a great yirdin! for an Angel oʼ the Lord cam doon frae Heeven, and cam and rowʼt awa the stane and sat onʼt. To look at him he was like the fire‐flaught, and his cleedin was white as the snaw; And, cuisten‐doon afore him, the gaird did trimmle, and war as deid men. But the angel, speaking to the weemen, said, “Be‐na ye fleyʼt! For I ken ye are seekin Jesus, the crucifyʼt. “He isna here! for he is risen, eʼen as he said! Come, see the bit whaur the Lord was lyin. “And gae quickly, and say ye to his disciples, ‘He is risen frae the deid!’ And mark! he gangs afore ye intil Galilee. Thar sal ye see him. See! I hae tellʼt ye!” And quickly leaʼin the tomb, in muckle fear and muckle joy, they ran to tak word to the disciples. And look! Jesus met them, and says, “All hail!” And they cam forrit, and grippit him by the feet, and worshippʼt him. Than says Jesus to them, “Fear‐na! But gae tell my brethren, sae as they may gang intil Galilee; thar sal they see me!” Noo, eʼen while they war gaun, some oʼ the gaird cam intil the citie, and tellʼt to the Heid‐priests aʼ that had been dune. And whan they had forgatherʼt wiʼ the Elders, and coonsellʼt thegither, they gied a routh oʼ siller till the sodgers; And quoʼ they, “Say ye, ‘His disciples cam in the nicht, and slippit awa wiʼ him whan we war sleepin.’ “And aiblins gin this come afore the Governor, we wull cajole him, and mak it siccar for you!” Sae they liftit the siller, and did as they war tellʼt; and this tale was spread abreid amang the Jews — aye, eʼen to this day. And the eleeven disciples gaed awa intil Galilee, to a mountain whaur Jesus had trystit them. And,  seein him, they adored him; hoobeit, some switherʼt. And Jesus, drawin nar, spak to them, sayin, “Thar has been gien to me aʼ pooer in Heeven, and on yirth! “Gang ye tharfor, and mak ye disciples oʼ aʼ the nations, bapteezin them intil the name oʼ the Faither, and oʼ the Son, and oʼ the Holie Spirit; “Schawin them hoo till observe aʼ things, eʼen as mony as I hae commandit ye. And tent ye! I am wiʼ ye aʼ the days; eʼen till aʼ time!” The first oʼ the Blythe‐Message oʼ Jesus Christ, Godʼs Son. Eʼen as it is putten‐doon by Esaiah  the prophet, “Lo! I send oot my messenger afore thy face, wha sal mak ready thy way for thy comin. “The sough oʼ ane cryin oot iʼ the waste, ‘Mak ye ready a gate for the Lord! Mak straucht his fit‐roads!’ ” Than raise John, bapteezin iʼ the muirlands, and preachin repentance‐baptism for the pittin‐awa oʼ sins. And thar gaed oot till him aʼ the kintra‐side oʼ Judea, and aʼ thae oʼ Jerusalem, and war bapteezʼt oʼ him iʼ the River Jordan, tellin oot their sins. And John was cleedit wiʼ camelsʼ?-?hair, and had a leather belt aboot him; and he did eat locusts and rock?-?hinny. And quoʼ he in his preachin, “Ane sterker nor I comes eftir me, the whang oʼ whase shoon I am‐na fit to lout doon and lowse! “I watir‐bapteeze ye; but he sal bapteeze ye wiʼ Holie Spirit!” And iʼ thae days it cam aboot that Jesus cam frae Nazareth iʼ Galilee and was bapteezʼt oʼ John in Jordan. And he, comin straucht frae the watir, saw the heevens unsteekit, and the Spirit like a doo comin doon upon him. And a voice cam frae Aboon, “Thou art the Beloved, My Son; in Thee I delicht!” And noo the Spirit leads him oot intil the muirlands. And he was iʼ the muirlands forty days, tempit oʼ Sautan; and he was wiʼ the wild beasts; and the Angels waitit on him. And eftir John was deliverʼt up, Jesus cam intil Galilee, giean oot the Blythe‐Message oʼ God; And sayin, “The waitin‐time is by‐past, and the Kingdom oʼ God has come; turn ye, and lippen the Joyfuʼ‐Message!” And gaun on by the Loch oʼ Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andro (Simonʼs brither), castin aboot iʼ the Loch; for they war fishermen. And Jesus says to them, “Come ye eftir me, and Iʼse mak ye fishers oʼ men!” And at ance, leaʼin their nets, they followʼt eftir him. And gaun on a wee, he saw James, Zebedeeʼs son, and John his brither, iʼ the boat, pittin their nets iʼ guid fettle. And at ance he caʼd them; and leaʼin their faither iʼ the boat wiʼ the fisher‐men, they gaed eftir him. And they cam intil Capernaum; and withoot delay, on the Sabbath day, he cam intil the kirk, and was teachin. And they war uncolie struck wiʼ astonishment at his teachin; for he spak as gin he had authoritie, and no like the Scribes. And noo, thar was iʼ the kirk a man wiʼ a foul spirit; and he cryʼt oot, Sayin, “What hae we wiʼ thee, thou Jesus oʼ Nazareth? Hast thou come to destroy us? I ken thee, wha thou art — Godʼs Holie Ane!” And Jesus forbad him, sayin, “Haud yere peace! and come oot oʼ him!” And the foul spirit, rivin, and cryinʼ wiʼ a great voice, cam oot oʼ him. And they war aʼ astoundit; sae that they coonsellʼt amang theirsels, “What is aʼ this? A new teachin! Like a Ruler he commauns eʼen the foul spirits, and they do his wull!” And the fame oʼ him spread abreid at ance ower aʼ the hail kintra‐side oʼ Galilee roond aboot. And noo, comin oot oʼ the kirk, they gaed intil the hoose oʼ Simon and Andro, wiʼ James and John. Noo Simonʼs gude‐mither was lyin wiʼ a fivver; and syne they tellʼt him aboot her. And he gaed ben, and took her by the haun, and raisʼt her up; and the fivver left her: and she waitit on them. And at eʼenin, iʼ the gloamin,  they brocht till him aʼ them that war ill, and them possessʼt wiʼ spirits; And the hail toun forgatherʼt at the door. And he healed mony that war ill wiʼ aʼ diseases; and cuist oot mony demons; and wadna lat the demons speak; for they kent him. And iʼ the mornin, lang afore the dawin, he raise up and gaed oot, and airtit him till a desert‐bit, and was thar prayin. And Simon, and the lave, followʼt eftir. And they faund him, and quoʼ they to him, “Aʼ folk seek thee!” And he says to them, “Lat us gang awa to the neist toons, that I may preach thar as weel; for to this end cam I oot.” And he gaed intil the kirks aʼ throwe Galilee, preachin and castin oot demons. And thar cam till him a leper, and besocht him, and loutit doon afore him, sayin to him, “Gin aiblins thou wad, thou can mak me clean!” And, touchʼt wiʼ rewth, he raxʼt oot his haun, and touchʼt him, and quoʼ he, “I wull; be ye clean!” And at ance the leprosy gaed frae him, and he was recoverʼt. And he stricklie chairged him; and than bad him awa; And says to him, “See! say ye nocht to ony; but gang yere ways, and schaw yersel to the priest, and offer for yere makin‐clean what Moses pat doon, to testify to them.” But he gaed oot, and begude to spread abreid the tale, sae that Jesus coud‐na gang intil ony citie, but was oot‐by in desert‐places: and they war comin till him frae aʼ pairts. Ance mair comin intil Capernaum, it was reportit, “He is neath a roof again!” And at ance the folk aʼ gaitherʼt thegither, sae that thar was nae room, no eʼen aboot the door: and He spak the word to them. And they cam, and brocht a man wiʼ a stroke, cairryʼt by fowr. And no bein able to fesh him in for the thrang, they strippit the riggin whaur Jesus was; and brekin throwe it, they lat doon the pallet on whilk the paralytic lay. Whan Jesus saw their faith, quoʼ he to the paralytic, “Son, yere sins are forgien ye!” But a wheen oʼ the Scribes had sutten doon thar; and quoʼ they iʼ their hearts, “Hoo isʼt that this ane speaks sae? He blasphemes! Wha can forgie sins, an it be‐na God?” And at ance, Jesus, takin tent in his ain spirit that they thocht thir things, says to them, “Why soud ye hae sic debatin iʼ yer ain hearts? “Whilk, think ye, is easier? to say, ‘Yere sins are forgienʼ, or to say, ‘Rise ye, and walk!’ “But that ye may ken the Son oʼ Man has pooer on the yirth to forgie sins” — (he says to the paralytic), “I say to ye, Rise; row up yere pallet, and gang yere ways till yere ain hoose!” And he raise up, and grippet his pallet, and gaed oot afore them aʼ; sae that they war clean beside theirsels, and glorifyʼt God, sayin, “We neʼer saw sic things!” And he gaed forth again by the side oʼ the Loch; and aʼ the thrang war comin aboot him, and he was teachin them. And, gaun by, he saw Levi, he oʼ Alpheus, in chairge oʼ the tax?-?gaitherin; and says till him, “Come ye wiʼ me!” And he raise, and followʼt him. And whan  he was at table in his hoose, mony tax‐men and sinners sat doon wiʼ Jesus and his disciples: for they war mony. And they followʼt him, eʼen the Scribes and the Pharisees; and whan they saw he was eatin wiʼ sinners and tax‐men, said to his disciples, “He eats and drinks wiʼ sinners and tax‐men!” And hearin it, Jesus says to them, “The strang and the weel hae nae need oʼ the leech, but the anes that are ill. I cam no to bid  holie anes, but sinners.” And the followers oʼ John and oʼ the Pharisees war fastin; and they come and quoʼ they, “Hoo isʼt that Johnʼs disciples, and the Phariseesʼ disciples fast, and the disciples ye mak dinna fast?” And quoʼ Jesus to them, “Coud the sons oʼ the bride‐chaumer fast, and the bridegroom amang them? Sae lang as the bridegroom bides wiʼ them, they canna fast! “But the days come whan the bridegroom is to be taen awa frae them; and than, iʼ thae days, sal they fast. “Nane evir schews a  clout oʼ unwaukit claith on an auld coat, or aiblins the new bit rives awa frae the auld, and the rent is the waur. “And nane evir teems new wine intil auld wine‐skins; or aiblins the wine wull rive the skins, and the wine is tint, and the skins baith; but new wine gangs intil fresh wine‐skins.” And it cam aboot that he gaed throwe the fields oʼ corn on the Sabbath; and his disciples begude to mak their way, pluckin the heids oʼ the corn. And the Pharisees say to him, “See! hoo isʼt they do on the Sabbath what is no allooʼt?” And says he to them, “Did ye nevir read what Dauvid did, whan he had need, and hungerʼt; he and thae wiʼ him? “How he gaed intil Godʼs Hoose, iʼ the time oʼ Abiathar, the Heigh‐priest, and did eat the Breid oʼ the Presence, whilk isna to be eaten but by the priests: and gied eʼen to them that war wiʼ him?” And said he to them, “The Sabbath was made for manʼs sake, and no man for the Sabbathʼs sake. “And sae the Son oʼ Man is maister eʼen oʼ the Sabbath!” And he cam again to the kirk; and a man was thar wiʼ a wizzenʼ haun. And they keepit watch ower him, gin he wad heal him on the Sabbath; sae as they micht wyte him. And quoʼ he to the man wiʼ the wizzenʼd haun, “Staun forth iʼ the mids!” And to them, quoʼ he, “Isʼt richt on the Sabbath to do gude or to do ill? to save life or to slay?” But they said nocht. And lookin roond aboot on them wiʼ indignation — haein grief for sic hardenin oʼ their hearts — he says to the man, “Rax oot yere haun!” And he strauchtit it oot; and his haun was made richt. And the Pharisees gaed oot, and begude coonsellin wiʼ Herodʼs pairty again him, hoo they micht mak awa wiʼ him? And Jesus, wiʼ his disciples, retirʼt to the Loch; and a great thrang frae Galilee followʼt; and frae Judea, And frae Edom, and ayont Jordan; and aboot Tyre and Sidon, a great thrang, hearin aʼ the things that he did, cam till him. And he spak to his disciples, that a smaʼ boat soud wait on him, on account oʼ sae mony folk: that they soudna thrang him. For he healed a hantle oʼ them; and they wiʼ plagues pressʼt on him to touch him. And foul spirits, whan they saw him, fell at his feet, cryin oot, “Thou art Godʼs Son!” And he chairged them stricklie that they soud‐na mak him to be kent. And he gaed up the mountain; and cries to him wham he wad hae; and they cam till him. And he waled oot twalʼ, that they micht be wiʼ him, and sae as he coud send them oot to preach; And to hae authoritie to expel demons. And he gied the name Peter to Simon; And James; and John, brither oʼ James; them he caʼd “Boanerges,” meanin, “Men oʼ Thunner.” And Andro, and Philip, and Bartholomie, and Matthew, and Tammas, and James oʼ Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot. And Judas Iscariot, wha eʼen deliverʼt‐him‐up. And they gaed intil a hoose. And the thrang cam thegither again; sae that they coudna eʼen get their breid eaten. And hearin oʼt, his ain folk gaed oot to grip him; for they said, “Heʼs clean wud!” And the Scribes — the anes that cam doon frae Jerusalem — said, “He has Beelzebul;” and, “by the prince oʼ the demons, the demons are cuisten oot.” And he brocht them nar, and says to them in parables, “Hoo isʼt that Sautan casts oot Sautan?” And, “Gin a kingdom be set again itsel, that kingdom maun faʼ!” And, “Gin a hoose be set again itsel, that hoose canna staun!” And, “Gin Sautan rise up again his sel, and be twa, he canna staun, but comes till an end. “Nae man comes intil the hald oʼ a michty man, to harrie his gudes and gear, till he has first bund‐doon the strang ane; and than wull he harrie his hoose. “Truly say I tʼye, aʼ things sal be forgien to the sons oʼ men, and aʼ the sins, and aʼ the miscaʼin they miscaʼ wiʼ; “But wha sal miscaʼ the Holie Spirit has pardon nevir! but is fetterʼd by an eternal  sin!” For that they war sayin, “He has a foul spirit!” Than cam his mither and his brithers; and staunin oot‐by, they sent till him, and caʼd him. And thar war mony folk sittin aboot him; and they say to him, “See! yere mither and yere brithers are oot‐by, seeking ye!” And he, answerin them, said, “Wha is my mither and my brithers?” And, lookin roond on thae sittin aboot him, he says, “See! my mither and my brithers! “For wha dis the wull oʼ God, that same is my brither, and sister, and mither!” And he begude again to teach by the Loch‐side. And an unco thrang gatherʼt till him, sae that he gaed intil a boat, and sat iʼ the Loch; and aʼ the folk war by the Loch, on the lanʼ. And he was teachin them a hantle oʼ things in his parables, and said to them in his teaching, “Hear ye! Behauld, a sawer gaed oot to saw; “And it cam aboot as he sawed, some was strinklʼt aside the fit‐road; and the burdies cam and devoorʼt it. “And some fell on rocky bits, whaur it faund little mool; and at ance it brairdit, for that the mool was jimp. “And whan the sun raise heigh, it was aʼ birslʼt up; and for that it had nae rute, it dwined awa. “And ither fell amang the thorns; and the thorns cam up, and smoored it, and it brocht forth naething. “And ither fell intil the gude grunʼ, and gied frute, risin up and growin mair; and brocht forth to thretty‐fauld, saxty‐fauld, and a hunner‐fauld.” And he said, “Wha has hearin to hear, lat him hear!” And whan he cam to be by his sel alane, thae that war aboot him, wiʼ the Twalʼ, speirʼt at him aboot the Parable. And he says to them, “To you the mysteries oʼ the Kingdom oʼ God hae been giʼen; but to them oot‐by, aʼ thir things are gien in parables; “Sae that lookin they may look, and no see; and hearin they may hear, and no understaun: gin aiblins they soud turn, and it soud be forgiʼen them.” And he says to them, “Ken‐ye‐na this parable? Hoo then wull ye ken aʼ the parables? “The sawer saws the Word. “And thir are they by the fit‐road, whan the Word is sawn; and whansoeʼer they hear, Sautan comes and cleeks awa the Word whilk was sawn amang them. “And thir are they as weel, that are sawn on the rocky bits; wha, whan they hear the Word, tak it to them wiʼ joy, “And they hae nae rute in their sels, but staun only for a wee; than whan fash and persecution arises for sake oʼ the Word, at ance they snapper and faʼ. “And ither are they sawn amang thorns; they that hear the Word; “And the cark oʼ the warld, and the glamor oʼ riches, and the fainness for ither things comin in, ding oot the Word, and it is unfrutefuʼ. “And yon are they on the gude grunʼ sawn, sic as hear the Word, and tak it in, and bear frute; thretty, saxty, and a hunner‐fauld.” And he said to them, “Dae ye fesh a licht and pit it under a cog, and no to be putten on the staun? “For naething is hidden, except aiblins that it micht be brocht oot; nor was keepit secret, but that it soud come to licht. “Gin ony man has hearin to hear, lat him hear!” And he said to them, “Tak tent what ye hear! in sic measur as ye gie, it sal be measurʼt to ye again — and mair! “For he wha has, sal hae mair gien to him; and he wha has‐na, frae him sal be taʼen eʼen what he has!” And he said, “Sae is Godʼs kingdom, as gin a man soud cast the seed on the yird; “And soud sleep and rise, nicht and day; and the seed soud braird, and be raxin oot, he kens‐na what way: “For the yird brings forth frute oʼ itsel; first the braird; eftir, the heid; eftir, the fuʼ pickle iʼ the heid. “But whansoever the frute wad gie itsel up, he pits in the heuk, for that the hairst has come.” And he said, “To what sal we marrow Godʼs kingdom? or wiʼ whatna pictur sal we pictur it? “Like to a seed oʼ the mustard; whilk, whan it is sawn iʼ the yirth, is smaʼer than aʼ the seeds sawn iʼ the yirth. “Yet whan it is sawn, it schutes up, and comes to be greater than aʼ the yerbs; and schutes oot great branches, sae that the burdies oʼ the air may howff under the beild oʼt.” And wiʼ a hantle oʼ sic‐like parables spak he to them the Word, as they war fit to hear it. And but in parables  spak he na to them; and whan they war by their sels, he exponed aʼ things to his disciples. And the same day, whan gloamin had come, he says to them, “Lat us gang ower till the ither side.” And sendin awa the thrang, they tak him, juist as they faund him, iʼ the boat; and ither boats war wiʼ them. And thar cam up a great tempest oʼ winʼ; and the waves war dashin ower intil the boat, sae that the boat was fillin. And he was iʼ the stern‐sheets oʼ the boat, sleepin on a wee pallet: and they rouse him, cryin, “Maister! care‐ye‐na that we perish?” And he roused up, and challenged the winʼ; and said to the Loch, “Peace! Be quate!” And the winʼ gaed doon, and aʼ was lown. And he said to them, “Why soud ye be fleyʼd? Hae ye no yet faith?” And they war in unco terror; and quoʼ they ane till anither, “Wha can this be, that eʼen the winʼs and the waves obey him?” And they cam to the ither side, to the pairts oʼ the Geresenes. And whan he was come oot oʼ the boat, strauchtway thar cam till him oot oʼ the tombs, a man wiʼ a foul spirit, Wha dwalt amang the tombs: and no eʼen wiʼ a chain was ony ane langer able to haud him: For he had aft been hauden wiʼ fetters and chains; and the chain had been puʼd sindry, and the fetters he brak in flinders: and nae man was sterk eneuch to tame him. And aye nicht and day was he iʼ the tombs and iʼ the mountains, cryin oot, and gashin his sel wiʼ stanes. And seein Jesus frae far yont, he ran and worshippʼt him. And cryʼt oot wiʼ a lood voice, “What is thar atween thee and me, Jesus? Son oʼ God maist heigh! I adjure thee by the name oʼ God, torment‐me‐na!” For he was sayin till him, “Come forth, thou foul spirit!” And he speirʼt at him, “What name hae ye?” And he answerʼt sayin, “Legion is my name: for we are mony!” And he was unco beseechin that he wadna send them awa clean oot oʼ thae pairts! And noo thar war nar the mountain a great herd oʼ swine, feedin. And they besocht him, “Lat us gang intil the swine, that we may enter intil them!” And he loot them gang. And the foul spirits gaed oot, and gaed intil the swine; and the herd rushed doon the scaur intil the Loch: aboot twa thoosand; and war drooned iʼ the Loch. And they that herdit the swine fled, and tellʼt it iʼ the citie and iʼ the kintra; and they cam oot to see what was dune. And they cam to Jesus, and saw him that was possessʼt wiʼ demons, sittin, cleedit, and in soond mind — the ane that had the legion — and they war awfuʼ feart. And the onlookers tellʼt them hoo it had fared wiʼ him that was possessʼt oʼ the demons, and aboot the swine as weel. And they begude to pray him to gang awa frae their pairts. And as he gaed intil the boat, he that had been in the pooer oʼ the demons besocht him that he micht be wiʼ him. And he didna alloo him; but quoʼ he till him, “Gang till yer hame, till yere freends, and  tell them hoo great things the Lord has dune for ye, and had mercie on ye.” And he gaed awa, and begude to spread abreid iʼ the Ten Cities, hoo great things Jesus had done for him, and aʼ men ferlied. And when Jesus had gane ower again iʼ the boat to the ither side, a great thrang war gatherʼt till him; and he was nar‐haun the Loch. And thar cam ane oʼ the elders oʼ the kirk, by name Jairus; and whan he saw him, he fell doon at his feet, And wiʼ muckle beseechin said, “My wee dochter is at deathʼs door; gin thou wad but come and lay thy hauns on her she wad be saved, and she wad leeve!” And he gaed wiʼ him; and an unco crood followʼt him; and they thranged him. And a  wumman, wha had a flowinʼ oʼ blude for twal years, And had dreeʼd muckle under mony doctors, and wared aʼ her gear, and was nane the better, but raither grew waur — Whan she heard oʼ the things aboot Jesus, cam iʼ the thrang ahint, and touched his cleedin. For quoʼ she to hersel, “Gin I but touch his cleedin, Iʼse be made hale!” And at ance the fountain oʼ her blude was stayed, and she kent in hersel that she was deliverʼt frae that plague. And Jesus, takin tent oʼ pooer gaun oot frae him, turned aboot iʼ the thrang, and said, “Wha touched me?” And the disciples said to him, “Thou sees the thrang pressinʼ on thee, and thou says, ‘Wha touched me?’” And he lookit weel roond, to see her wha had dune this thing. And the wumman, swarfinʼ wiʼ fear, kennin what was dune till her, cam forrit and fell doon afore him, and tellʼt him aʼ the truth. And quoʼ he to her, “Dochter, yere faith has made ye hale; gang in peace, and be hale oʼ yere plague!” But eʼen while he spak, cam they frae the kirk‐elderʼs hoose to say, “Yere dochterʼs deid! Hoo sood ye fash the Master mair?” But at ance Jesus, overhearin what was said, says to the kirk‐elder, “Fear‐na; only lippen!” But he loot nane follow him, but only Peter and James and John (Jamesʼ brither). And they cam intil the hoose oʼ the kirk‐elder; and he saw a fash, and folk greetin and wailin uncolie. And whan he cam in, quoʼ he to them, “Hoo mak ye aʼ this ado, and greetin? The lassieʼs no deid, but sleepin.” And they leuch at him. But he, whan he had putten them aʼ oot, took the faither oʼ the wean, and the mither, and them that war wiʼ him, and gaed ben whaur the lassie was. And takin the haun oʼ the wean, he says till her, “Talitha cumi!” that is, “Lassie, wauken!” And at ance the lassie raise, and gaed aboot; for she was twal year auld. And they ferlied wiʼ an unco amazement. And he chairged them tichtly that nane soud ken oʼt; and spak for her to hae some meat. And he gaed oot frae that, and cam till his ain kintra‐side: and his disciples followʼt wiʼ him. And whan the Sabbath cam, he begude to teach iʼ the kirk; and the thrang hearin him, war astoundit, and quoʼ they, “Whaur gat this ane thir things?” And, “Whatna lear is this that is gien to this ane?” And, “Sic warks oʼ pooer he pits frae his hauns!” “Is this no the carpenter, Maryʼs son, brither to James and Joses, and Judas and Simon? And are na his sisters here wiʼ us?” And they took a scunner at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is no wantin his honors gin it be‐na in his ain place, and amang his ain freends, and in his ain hoose.” And he coudna finʼ to do ony wark oʼ pooer thar, mair than to lay his hauns on a wheen sick folk, and to heal them. And he was uncolie putten‐aboot wiʼ their unbelievin. And he gaed aʼ roond in the wee touns, teachin. And he caʼd till him the Twalʼ, and begude to send them oot, twa  and twa; and he gied them pooer ower foul spirits; And chairged them to tak nocht for the journey, but only a staff; nae bannocks, nae wallet, nae plack iʼ their purse; But only shod wiʼ sandals. And quoʼ he, “Pit‐na on twa coats.” And he said to them, “Intil whatna place ye gang till a hoose, bide thar till ye gang awa frae the place. “And whatna place wull‐na receive ye, nor hear to ye, as ye gang oot fraeʼt, flaff aff the vera gryminʼ oʼ mool frae yere feet for a witness again them.” And gaun oot, they preached that men micht repent. And they cuist oot mony demons, and anointit wiʼ oyle a hantle oʼ sick anes, and made them hale. And King Herod heard; for his name was muckle spoken oʼ: and he said, “John Baptist has risen frae the deid! and thus their pooers are wrocht in him.” But ithers war threepin, “It is Elijah!” And ithers again, “A Prophet!” or, “Like ane oʼ the Prophets!” But Herod, comin to hear, said, “John, wham I beheidit is risen frae the deid!” For Herod his sel had sent oot, and laid haud oʼ John, and putten him in prison, for the sake oʼ Herodias, his brother Philipʼs wife; for he had marryʼt her. For John tellʼt Herod, “It is no allooʼd for ye to hae the wife oʼ yere brither!” And sae Herodias held a grudge again him, and wad hae slain him: but she coudna. For Herod was in fear oʼ John, kennin him to be a just and holie man, and keepit him safe: and listenin till him, he did a hantle oʼ things, and was fain to hear him. And a fit day comin, whan Herod on his birthday made a feast for his nobles, and the heigh rulers, and chiefs oʼ Galilee; And the dochter oʼ this vera Herodias cam in and danced, she sae took wiʼ Herod and them feastin wiʼ him, that the King said to the wench, “Demand oʼ me what ye wull, and Iʼll gie ye!” And he swure to her, “whatever ye demand oʼ me, Iʼll gie ye, eʼen to the hauf oʼ my Kingdom!” And she gaed oot, and said to her mither, “What sal I ask!” and quoʼ she, “The heid oʼ John Baptist!” And she cam ben quickly to the King, and askit, sayin, “I wull that ye gie me, belvye, the heid oʼ John Baptist on a server!” And the King was unco cuisten‐doon; but for his aiths, and for them that feastit wiʼ him, he wadna refuse her. And withoot delay the King sent oot ane oʼ his gaird, and gied orders to bring his heid: and he gaed and beheidit him iʼ the prison; And he brocht his heid on a server, and gied it to the wench, and the wench gied it to her mither. And when his disciples heard oʼt, they cam and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb. And the Apostles gatherʼt theirsels thegither to Jesus; and they tellʼt him as mony things as they had dune, and what they had been teachin. And he said to them, “Come ye by yersels apairt intil a desert‐bit, and rest yersels for a wee.” For thar war mony comin and gaun, that they coudna get their breid eaten. And they gaed awa quately iʼ the boat, till a desert spot. And mony saw them gaun aff, and took tent; and a‐fit, oot oʼ aʼ the cities, they ran, and wan there afore them. And he cam oot, and saw an unco thrang: and he had pitie on them, for they war as sheep wantin a Shepherd: and he begude to teach them mony things. And whan the day was nar endit, his disciples cam till him, and quoʼ they, “This place is desert, and the gloamin is comin on: “Send them awa, that they gang to the kintra and intil the neebor touns, and buy theirsels fendin.” And he answerin, says to them, “You gie them to eat!” And they say to him, “Sal we gang and ware twa hunner siller‐pennies on breid, and gie them to eat?” He says to them, “Hoo mony laives hae ye? gang and see!” And whan they had speirʼt, they say “Fyve, and twa speldrins.” And he gied orders that aʼ soud sit doon,  banquet‐like, on the green gerss. And they loutit doon in order, in fifties and hunners. And he took the fyve bannocks and the twa speldrins, and lookit up till Heeven, and blessʼt, and brak the bannocks, and gaed on giean to the disciples to serʼ them: and the speldrins portioned he oot to them aʼ. And they aʼ did eat, and war satisfyʼt. And they gatherʼt what was ower oʼ the bannocks, and oʼ the fish, twal baskets fuʼ. And they that did eat the bannocks war aboot fyve thoosand men. And noo he wad hae his disciples to gang intil the boat, and gang ower to the other side — by Bethsaida — while he skailʼt the thrang. And eftir he had pairtit wiʼ the thrang, he gaed up intil the mountain to pray. And whan the eʼenin cam on, the boat was in the mids oʼ the Loch, and he alane on the lanʼ. And seein them sair forfochten wiʼ the rowin — for the winʼ was contrar — aboot the hinmaist watch oʼ the nicht he cam till them, walkin on the Loch; and seemed to gang by them. But they, seein him walkin on the Loch, thocht it had been a ghaist, and cryʼt oot. For they aʼ saw him, and war sair putten‐aboot. But he begude to speak to them, and says to them, “Cheer‐up! be‐na fleyʼt!” And he cam up to them, intil the boat; and the winʼ gaed doon. And they war sair amazed ayont a measur, and ferlied. For they couldna comprehend aboot the bannocks; for their heart was turned hard. And gangin ower, they cam to the lanʼ oʼ Gennesaret; and tyʼt up at the shore. And whan they war come oot oʼ the boat, he was kent at ance. And they ran through aʼ thar?-?awa roond aboot, and begude to cairry aboot on their pallets them that war sick, whaureʼer they heard he was. And ilka place he gaed till — intil wee touns, or cities, or a wheen hooses thegither — they lay doon the sick iʼ the merkit‐places; and besocht him that aiblins they micht touch but the vera fringe oʼ his mantle: and as mony as touched war made hale. And thar are gatherʼt aboot him the Pharisees, and the Scribes that had come doon frae Jerusalem. And, takin tent that some oʼ his disciples war eatin breid wiʼ unpurifyʼt — that is, unweshen — hauns, they challenged them. For the Pharisees, and aʼ the Jews, gin they wesh‐na their hauns religiously, eat‐na; haudin fast the traditions oʼ the Elders. And comin frae the merkit — gin they wesh‐na their sels, they eat‐na. And mony mair things are thar that they hae acceptit to haud; — purifyin oʼ cups and stowps, coppers and table?-?couches. And the Pharisees and the Scribes speir at him, “Hoo isʼt thy disciples gang‐na conform to the tradition oʼ the Elders, but eat their breid wiʼ unpurifyʼt hauns?” But he said, “Weel did Esaiah prophesie oʼ you, dissemblers! as it is putten doon:— ‘This nation honor me wiʼ their lips, but their heart they haud faur‐awa frae me! “ ‘But they offer devotion to me in vain, teachin as precepts the commandments oʼ men.’ “For haein put‐awa Godʼs commaun, ye haud fast the tradition oʼ men — purifyin oʼ cups and stowps; and mony sic‐like things ye do.” And he said to them, “Fuʼ weel ye reject the commaun oʼ God, that ye may haud yer ain tradition. “For Moses said, ‘Honor yere faither and yere mither: and wha sal revile faither and mither, by death lat him dee.’ “But ye say, Gin a man sal say to his faither or his mither, ‘Whatsoeʼer ye micht hae frae me is Corban,’ — that is, dedicate to God — “Ye nae mair suffer him to do aucht for his faither or his mither, “Makin void Godʼs word by yere tradition ye hae deliverʼt! And mony sic things ye do.” And caʼin to him the thrang oʼ folk again, he says to them, “Hear me, every ane oʼ ye, and understaun! “Thar is naething frae  withoot a man, enterin intil him, can fyle him; but the things that gae forth oot oʼ the man, they fyle him. “Gin ony ane has hearin to hear, lat him tak tent!” And whan he was come intil the hoose frae the thrang, his disciples speirʼt at him anent the parable. And he says to them, “Are even you wantin discernment? Can ye no see that whatsoeʼer frae withoot that comes intil the man, canna fyle him? “For it comes‐na ben intil his heart, but only to his stammack; and gaes intil the sewer, purifyin aʼ meat.” This he said, moreover, “What comes forth oot oʼ the man, that fyles the man! “For frae within, frae ben iʼ the hearts oʼ men, ill designs come forth: lecherie, thefts, murders, “Adulteries, covetins, knaveries, deceit, wantonness, envy, evil?-?speakin, loftiness, foolishness; “Aʼ thir ill things proceed frae within, and they fyle the man!” And frae thar he raise, and gaed intil the borders oʼ Tyre and Sidon. And he enterʼt intil a hoose, and wad hae nae man ken; but he coudna be keepit private. But forthwith a wumman, whase wee dochter had a foul spirit, hearinʼ aboot him, cam and fell doun at his feet. The wumman was a Greek, a Canaanite by blude; and she besocht him that he wad cast the demon oot oʼ her dochter. And he said to her, “The bairn soud first be satisfeeʼt; it isna bonnie to tak the bairnʼs breid, and cast it to the dowgs.” But she answerʼt, and said to him, “Eʼen sae, Lord; yet the wee dowgs aneath the table eat oʼ the mools oʼ the bairns?” And he said to her, “For that word, gang yere ways; the demon has gane forth oot oʼ yere dochter.” And gaun awa to her hoose, she faund the bairn lyin on the couch, and the demon gane forth. And again, gaun forth oot oʼ the pairts oʼ Tyre, he cam throwe Sidon to the Loch oʼ Galilee, up throwe the pairts oʼ the Ten Cities. And they bring to him ane that can hear nane, and speak but a wee; and they beg that he wad lay his haun on him. And he led him aside frae the thrang, and pat his fingers intil his lugs, and touched his tongue wiʼ spittle; And lookin up to heeven, he gied a sigh, and said, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be thou unbarred!” And his lugs war unsteekit, and the string oʼ his tongue was lowsed, and he spak plain. And he instruckit them that they soud tell nane: but accordin as he instruckit them, sae muckle the mair did they tell oʼt: And they were astonishʼt ayont aʼ bounds, sayin, “He has done aʼ things weel! He gars eʼen the deif to hear, and the dumb to speak!” In thae days, whan again there was a great thrang, and they had naething to eat, Jesus caʼd his disciples, and said to them, “I hae pitie on the folk; for they hae been wiʼ me now thrie days, and hae‐na to eat. “And gin I send them hungerin awa to their hames, they wull swarf by the way; for a hantle oʼ them come frae far awa.” And his disciples answerʼt him, “In whatna gate coud we be able to fill thir men wiʼ bannocks, here in a wilderness?” And he speirʼt at them, “Hoo mony bannocks hae ye?” And they said, “Seeven.” And he commandit the thrang to lout doon on the grunʼ: and takin the seeven bannocks, and giean thanks, he brak, and gied to his disciples to set afore them; and they set afore the thrang. And they had a wheen smaʼ speldrins; and he blessʼt, and had them set them on as weel. And they did eat, and war satisfyʼt: and they took up oʼ the broken bits ower, seeven creels‐fuʼ. Noo, they that war eatin war aboot fowr thoosanʼ; and he sent them awa. And withoot delay, gaun intil a boat wiʼ his disciples, he cam intil the kintra‐side oʼ Dalmanutha. And oot cam the Pharisees, and begude to argue wiʼ him; seekin frae him some token frae Heeven — tempin him. And deeply maenin in his saul, he says, “Why soud this generation ask a token? Truly say I tʼye, nae token sal be gien till this generation!” And he left them, and again launchin oot, cam to the ither side. And they forgat to tak laives; nor had they iʼ the boat wiʼ them mair nor ae bannock. And he warned them, “Tak tent, beware oʼ the barm oʼ the Pharisees, and the barm oʼ Herod! And they war coonsellin amang theirsels, “We hae brocht nae laives!” And Jesus, takin tent, says to them, “Why soud ye be quaistenin thegither for that ye hae nae laives! Dae ye no yet see nor understaun? Hae ye yere heart hardened yet? “Hae ye een, and see‐na? and lugs, and hear‐na? and dae ye no caʼ to mind? “When I brak the fyve bannocks to the fyve‐thoosanʼ, hoo mony baskets‐fuʼ oʼ mools took ye up?” They say to him, “Twal.” “And whan the seeven for the fowr‐thoosanʼ, hoo mony creels‐fuʼ oʼ the mools did ye tak up?” And they said, “Seeven.” And he says to them, “Dae ye no yet comprehend?” And they cam intil Bethsaida; and they bring till him ane blinʼ, and beseech him to touch him. And he laid haud oʼ the blinʼ man by the haun, and brocht him forth oot oʼ the toun; and whan he had putten spittle on his een, and putten his hauns on him, he speirʼt at him, “Dae ye see aucht?” And he lookit up, and said, “I see men; for they are like trees, walkin aboot!” And again  he pat his hauns on his een, and he saw clearly and was restored; seeinʼ aʼ things in splendor. And he sent him awa till his hame; sayin, “Naither gang intil the toun, nor tell it to ony in the toun!” And Jesus gaed, and his disciples, intil the touns oʼ Philipʼs Cesarea; and iʼ the way he says to his disciples, “Wha dae man say I am?” And they answerʼt, “John the Baptist; but ithers Elijah; and a wheen, ane oʼ the Prophets.” And he speirʼt at them, “Wha say ye I am?” Peter answers and says to him, “Thou art the Anointit Ane!” And he straitly chairged them to tell nae man oʼ him. And he begude to schaw them that the Son oʼ Man maun dree mony things, and be rejeckit oʼ the Elders, and the Heid‐priests, and the Scribes, and be slain; and eftir thrie days to rise again. And he was speakin this thing freely. Than Peter, takin him in haun, begude to repruve him. But he, turnin aboot, and fixin his een on the disciples, rebukit Peter, sayin, “Get you ahint me, Sautan! for ye are na seekin the things oʼ God, but the things oʼ men!” And caʼin till him the thrang, wiʼ his disciples, he said to them, “Wha ettles to follow me, lat him deny his ain sel, and tak up his cross, and come eftir me! “For whasae fain wad save his life, sal tine it; but whasae sal tine his life for the sake oʼ me and the Gude‐Word, sal save it! “For what sal a man be betterʼt, gin he win the hail warld, and tine his ain saul? “For what may a man gie, to niffer for his saul? “For whasae sal think shame oʼ me and my words, in this fause and sinfuʼ generation, the Son oʼ Man sal eke be ashamed oʼ him, whan he comes iʼ the glorie oʼ the Faither wiʼ the holie angels. And he said to them, “Truly say I tʼye, thar are some staunin here, wha sal in naegate pree death, till they hae seen the Kingdom oʼ God comin in pooer!” And eftir sax days Jesus taks Peter, and James, and John, and feshes them up intil a heigh mountain, allenarlie: and he was transformed afore them. And his cleedin becam unco glitterin white, as white as snaw; sic as nae wauk‐miller on the yirth coud white them. And Elijah and Moses appearʼt to them; and they spak wiʼ Jesus. And Peter answerin, says to Jesus, “Maister, it is bonnie for us to be here! and lat us mak thrie bothies; for thee ane; and for Moses ane; and for Elijah ane!” For he kent‐na what to say; for they war sair terrifyʼt. And thar cam a clud ower‐shadin them; and a voice spak oot oʼ the clud, “This is my Son! The Beloved! Hear ye till him!” And aʼ oʼ a suddaintie, lookin roond, thar was nae ane to be seen, but only Jesus wiʼ their sels. And as they war comin doon frae the mountain, he chairged them that they soud tell nae man the things they had seen, till ance the Son oʼ Man soud rise frae the deid. And they keepit that sayin amang their sels, what the “Risin‐frae‐the‐deid” was. And they speirʼt at him, sayin, “The Scribes haud that Elijah maun first come!” And he answerʼt and tauld them, “Elijah, indeed, dis come first, to pit aʼ things to richts; and yet hoo is it written oʼ the Son oʼ Man, that he maun dree mony things, and be unco lichtlied? “But I say tʼye, Elijah is come! and they hae done to him whatsaeʼer they wad, eʼen as it is putten doon concernin him.” And whan they joined the disciples they saw a great thrang aboot them, and the Scribes speirin at them. And at ance aʼ the folk, whan they gat a glisk oʼ him, war in unco astonishment; and rinnin to him, salutit him. And he said to him, “What was ye speirin at them aboot?” And ane frae mang the crood said, “Maister! I hae brocht my son, wha has a dumb spirit, to thee. “And whaureʼer it taks him, it rives him; and he froths, and cherks wiʼ his teeth, and dwines awaʼ; and I spak to thy disciples, that they micht cast it oot, but they couldna!” But he answerin says, “O race wantin faith. Till whatna time sal I hae to bide wʼye? Till whatna time sal I thole ye? Bring him tae me!” And they brocht him to him. And seein him, forthwith the spirit dang him; and he fell on the grunʼ, and rowʼt, frothin. And he speirʼt at his faither, “Hoo long syne this cam on him?” And he said, “Frae a bairn! “And aft it has cuisten him intil the fires, and intil waters, to mak an end oʼ him: but gin thou can do onything, hae pitie on us, and help us!” And Jesus says, “ ‘Gin thou can!’ — Aʼ things can come to him wha believes!” And forthwith the laddieʼs faither cryʼt oot, and quoʼ he, “Lord! I believe! Tak awa my unbelief!” But Jesus, seein that mony folk war comin, rinnin thegither, challenged the foul spirit, sayin tillʼt, “Ye dumb and deif spirit! I command ye, come oot oʼ him; and come nae mair intil him!” And cryin oot, and sair manglin him, he cam oot; and the laddie was like ane deid; sae that the feck oʼ them said, “He is deid!” But Jesus grippit his haun, and helpit him up; and he raise. And whan they war inside, the disciples speirʼt at him, “Why coud‐na we cast it oot?” And he said, “This sort gangs‐na oot but by prayer and fastin.” And fra thar they gaed forth, and journeyʼt throwe Galilee; and he wadna that ony man soud ken. For he was teachin his disciples, sayin to them, “The Son oʼ Man is deliverʼt up intil the hauns oʼ men, and they wull slay him: and eftir he is slain, in thrie days he wull rise again.” But they comprehendit‐na his words, and war fleyʼt to ask him. And they cam to Capernaum; and bein iʼ the hoose, he speirʼt at them, “What war ye arguin on the way?” And they said nocht; for on the road they had been arguin “Wha was greatest?” And he sut him doon, and caʼd the Twalʼ, and says to them, “Gin ony ane wad be first, he sal be last oʼ aʼ, and servitor oʼ aʼ.” And, takin a bairn, he set it iʼ the mids oʼ them, and fauldin it in his airms, he said to them, “Wha sal tak till him ane oʼ sic bairns as thir, for the sake oʼ me, taks me till him; and wha taks me till him, taks no me but him that sent me!” John says to him, “Maister, we saw ane iʼ thy name castin oot demons; and he gangs‐na wiʼ us; and we forbad him, for he gangs‐na wiʼ us.” And Jesus said, “Forbid‐him‐na; for thar is nane that sal do a wark oʼ pooer iʼ my name, and than be able to speak ill oʼ me. “For he that is no again us is for us. “For wha sal gie ye a cup oʼ water to drink, iʼ the mind that ye are Christʼs, truly say I tʼye, he tines‐na his reward! “And whasae sal ensnare ane oʼ thir wee anes that lippen on me, it war better for him gin the  muckle millstane was hangʼt aboot his neck, for him to be cuisten intil the sea! “And gin aiblins yere haun ensnare ye, aff wiʼt! it is bonnier for ye enterin intil life maimed, than to hae the twa hauns and gang intil hell, intil lowe unquenchable! “Whaur their worm dees‐na, and their lowe isna quenched! “And gin yere fit ensnare ye, aff wiʼt! it is bonnier for ye enterin into life haltin, than wiʼ twa feet to be cuisten intil hell, intil lowe unquenchable. “Whaur their worms dees‐na, and their lowe isna quenched! “And gin yere eʼe ensnare ye, pyke it oot! it is bonnier for ye enterin intil life ae‐eʼed, than wiʼ twa een to be cuisten intil hell, “Whaur their worm dees‐na, and their lowe isna quenched! “For ilka ane sal be sautit wiʼ fire; and ilka offeran sal be sautit wiʼ saut. “Gude is the saut. But gin the saut hae tint its tang, hoo sal ye mak it saut again! Hae saut in yersels, and be at peace ane wiʼ anither!” And risin up, he cam intil the borders oʼ Jordan. And thrangs cam thegither till him again; and, as he aye did, he instruckit them again. And the Pharisees cam nar till him, and they wad ken, “Is it lawfuʼ for a man to pit awa a wife?” tempin him. And answerin them, quoʼ he, “What dis Moses commaun?” And they said, “Moses allooed a writin oʼ divorce, and to put her awa.” But Jesus answerʼt, “Anent the hardness oʼ yere hearts, he wrate ye this commaun. “But frae the first oʼ the creation, God formed them male and female. “And fore‐anent this sal a man leaʼ his faither and his mither, and cling till his wife: “And they twa sal be ae flesh: sae are they nae mair twa, but ae flesh. “Whasae, than, God has joined thegither let‐na man pit sindry!” And whan they war within again, the disciples speirʼt at him anent it. And he says to them, “Whasae pits awa his wife, and taks anither, commits adultery against his wife. “And gin a woman divorces her husband, and taks anither, she commits adultery.” And they war bringin till him bairns, that he soud touch them; but the disciples challenged them that brocht them. But when Jesus saw it, he was unco displeased, and said to them, “Lat the wee anes come to me: hinner‐them‐na: for oʼ siccan anes is the kingdom oʼ God! “Truly say I tʼye, Whasae taks‐na till him the kingdom oʼ God as a wee bairn, heʼse in naegate comin in!” And he clippit them up in his airms, and socht blessings on them, and pat his hauns on them. And as he was gaun oot in the way, ane cam rinnin, and loutit doon afore him, and speirʼt at him, “Gude Maister! what maun I do to heir eternal life?” And Jesus says to him, “Why dae ye caʼ me ‘Gude?’ Thar is but Ane gude — God! “Ye ken the commauns — kill‐na, commit‐na avoutrie, steal‐na, mansweir‐na, wrangously seek‐na, cherish faither and mither!” And he said to him, “Maister, aʼ thae things hae I watched ower sinʼ my bairnheid!” And Jesus, lookin upon him, loʼed him, and said to him, “Ye hae ae thing wantin; gang, and sell whatsae ye hae, and gae to the puir; and yeʼll hae gear in Heeven: and come, follow ye me!” But dule cam on him at that sayin; and he gaed his ways sorrowfuʼ; for he was haudin great estates. And Jesus lookit roond aboot, and says he to his disciples, “Wiʼ what sair strivin sal they win to Heeven wha hae the riches!” And the disciples ferlied uncolie at the words. But Jesus answers again, and quoʼ he to them, “Bairns, what sair strivin sal it be to enter the kingdom oʼ God! “Itʼs suner that a camel gangs throwe a needleʼs ee, than that a rich man gangs intil the kingdom oʼ God!” And they were amazʼt ayont aʼ bounds, and quoʼ they, “Than wha can be saved?” And gazin on them, Jesus says, “Wiʼ men it is impossible; but no wiʼ God: wiʼ God, aʼ things are possible!” Than Peter begude to say to him, “See! we laid doon aʼ, and followʼt thee!” And Jesus answerʼt, “Truly say I tʼye, nane has left hoose, or brithers, or sisters, or faither or mither, or bairns, or mailins, for my sake and the Gude‐Wordʼs sake, “But sal win a  hunner‐fauld noo in this time — hooses, and brithers, and sisters, and mithers, and bairns, and mailins, wiʼ persecutions; and iʼ the warld to come, eternal life! “But mony first sal be hinmaist; and the hinmaist first.” Noo they war on the gate till Jerusalem; and Jesus was gaun afore them; and they ferlied sair; and as they followʼt, they war fleyʼt. And he took the Twalʼ, and begude again to tell them the things that soud befaʼ him: “Tak tent! we gang up till Jerusalem; and the Son oʼ Man sal be deliverʼt up to the Heigh‐priests, and Scribes, and they sal adjudge him to deid, and sal gie him ower to the heathen; “And they will geck at him, and will spit upon him, and will clour him, and will slay him; and eftir thrie days wull he arise.” And James and John, the sons oʼ Zebedee, cam; and they say to him. “Maister! we wad that thou soud do for us whatsoeʼer we ask oʼ Thee!” And he says to them, “What isʼt ye wad hae me to do for ye?” And they say to him, “Gie until us that we may sit, ane on thy richt haun, and ane on thy left, in thy glorie!” Jesus says to them, “Ye ken‐na what ye are seekin! Can ye drink the cup I drink oʼ? or be bapteezt wiʼ the bapteezin I am bapteezʼt wi?” And they say to him, “We can.” And Jesus says to them, “The cup I drink oʼ ye sal drink; and wiʼ the bapteezin I am bapteezʼt wiʼ sal ye be bapteezʼt: “But to sit on my richt haun and on my left haun isna mine to gie — but for to be gien to them for wham it is gotten ready!” And jalousinʼit, the Ten begude to hae indignation at James and John. And Jesus caʼd them till him, and said, “Ye ken that they wha seem to be rulin ower the nations, lord it ower the folk; and their great anes come doon wiʼ authoritie upon them. “But no in sic like sal it be amang ye; for wha wad become great amang ye, sal be yere servitor: “And wha wad be first amang ye, sal be yere thirlman. “For truly the Son oʼ Man cam‐na to be serʼt, but to serʼ; and to gie his life a ransom for mony.” And they cam tae Jericho; and as he gaed oot oʼ Jericho wiʼ his disciples and a hantle oʼ folk, the son oʼ Timeus, blinʼ Bartimeus, the beggar, was sittin by the way. And whan he heard it was Jesus oʼ Nazareth, he begude to cry oot, “Jesus, thou Son oʼ Dauvid! hae thou mercy on me!” And mony flytit on him, that he sud be quate. But he cryʼt sae muckle the mair, an unco deal, “Thou Son oʼ Dauvid! hae mercy on me!” And Jesus stude still, and said, “Caʼ ye him!” and they caʼd the blinʼ man, sayin, “Cheer up! Rise! Heʼs caʼin ye!” And he, thrawin aff his manteel, sprang up, and cam to Jesus. And Jesus, answerin him, says, “What wad ye that I soud do till ye?” And the blinʼ man said, “Lord! that I may hae my sicht!” And Jesus said to him, “Gang yere ways! yere faith has made ye hale!” And forthwith he gat his sicht, and followʼt  Jesus. And whan they cam nar to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethanie at the Mount oʼ Olives, he sent awa twa oʼ his disciples. And says to them, “Gang yere ways to the clachan fornent ye; and as sune as ye are come intilʼt, ye sal see a cowt tethered, whauron nae man evir sat; lowse him and fetch him. “And gin ony man say ocht to ye, or “Why dae ye this?” say ye, ‘The Maister has need oʼ him, and belvye he sends him back again.’ ” And they gaed their ways, and faund the cowt tethered at a door oot‐by iʼ the street; and they lowse him. And some oʼ thae that stude thar says to them, “What are ye daein? lowsin the cowt?” And they tellʼt them eʼen as Jesus said to them; and they loot them gang. And they fesh the cowt till Jesus; and they cuist on him their manteels; and he sat upon them. And a hantle spread their manteels iʼ the way; and ithers green branches, cuttin them oot oʼ the fields. And they that gaed afore, and they that followʼt eftir, cryʼt, “Hosanna! Blessed is he wha comes iʼ the name oʼ the Lord! “Blessed is the comin kingdom oʼ oor faither Dauvid! Hosanna iʼ the highest Heeven!” And he enterʼt intil Jerusalem, intil the Temple; and whan he had taen tent oʼ aʼ things, it noo wearin late, he gaed oot till Bethanie wiʼ the Twalʼ. And on the morn, whan he cam back frae Bethanie, he hungerʼt. And seein a fig‐tree ayont, fuʼ oʼ leaves, he gaed, gin aiblins he micht finʼ onything onʼt: and whan he cam tillʼt, he faund naething but leaves; for it wasna the time oʼ figs. And Jesus spak,  and says to it, “Nae man forever again eat frute oʼ thee!” and his disciples war listenin tillʼt. And they cam to Jerusalem; and enterin the Temple, he begude to caʼ oot thae sellin and buyin iʼ the Temple; and cowpit ower the tables oʼ the nifferers oʼ siller, and the binks oʼ thae that trokit wiʼ doos: And he wadna suffer ony man to cairry veschels throwe the Temple. And he was teachin, and sayin to them, “Is it no putten doon, ‘My Hoose sal be named a Hoose oʼ Prayer for aʼ people;’ but ye hae made it a howff oʼ robbers!” And the Heid‐priests and the Scribes heard; and coonsellʼt hoo they micht destroy him: for they war fleyʼt oʼ him, for aʼ the folk war astonishʼt at his teachin. And whaneʼer the eʼenin cam, he gaed oot oʼ the citie. And iʼ the mornin as they gaed by, they saw the fig‐tree birslʼt up frae the rutes. And Peter caʼin to minʼ, says to him, “Maister! see: the fig‐tree ye bannʼd, is aʼ dwined awa!” And Jesus, answerin to him, says, “Hae ye faith in God! “For truly say I tʼye, whasae may say to this mountain, ‘Be ye taʼen up, and cuisten intil the sea!’ and doots‐na in his heart — but sal lippen that what he says sal come to pass — he sal win it! “And thus I say to ye, Aʼ things that ye pray and seek for, lippen that ye hae them, and ye sal win them. “And whan prayin ye staun, forgie, gin ye hae ocht again ony ane; that yere Faither wha is in Heeven may forgie yere sins. “For gin ye forgie‐na, yere Faither in Heeven wull forgie‐na your sins!” And they come to Jerusalem again; and as he was walkin aboot iʼ the Temple, the Heid‐priests, and the Scribes, and the Elders, cam to him, And quoʼ they to him, “By whatna authoritie div ye thir things? And wha is he that gied ye this authoritie to do thir things?” But Jesus said, “I wull speir at you aʼe thing; and answer me: and I wull tell ye by whatna authoritie I do thir things:— “Johnʼs Baptism,  — wasʼt frae Heeven? or oʼ man? Ye may answer me!” And they coonsellʼt amang their sels, sayinʼ, “Gin we say, ‘Frae Heeven,’ he will say, ‘On what grunʼ than, did ye no believe him?” “But gin we sae ‘Frae menʼ ” — they war fleyʼt oʼ the folk; for ane and aʼ held John in veritie to be a prophet. And they answerʼt Jesus, and said, “We canna tell!” And Jesus says to them, “Nae mair div I tell you by whatna authoritie I do thir things!” And he begude to speak to them in parables. “A man set oot a vine‐yaird, and biggit a waʼ aboot it, and howkit a vat, and set up a tooer, and let it oot to crofters, and gaed aff intil anither kintra. “And he sent a servin‐man to the crofters at the season, to hae frae the crofters oʼ the frute oʼ the vine‐yaird. “And they grippit him, and dang him, and sent him toom awaʼ. “And again he sent to them anither oʼ his servants, and him they cloured on the heid, and did shamefuʼ by him. “And again he sent anither; and him they slew; and mony mair; whiles dingin them, and whiles slayin them. “Yet had he ane, a tenderly?-?loʼed son: he sent him last to them, sayin, ‘They will honor my son!’ “But thae crofters coonsellʼt amang their sels, ‘This is the heir! Come awa! lat us kill him; and we may seize on his hame‐haddin!’ “And they grippit him and slew him, and cuist him oot oʼ the vine‐yaird. “And noo, what sal the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird do? He wull come, and destroy the crofters, and gie the vine‐yaird ower to ithers. “Hae ye never read this writin, ‘The stane that was refused oʼ thae that biggit, the same is made heid oʼ the corner! “ ‘This cam to pass frae the Lord, and it is an unco ferlie in oor eʼen!’ ” And they ettled to lay haud oʼ him; but they war fleyʼt oʼ aʼ the folk; for they saw he had spoken this parable anent them: and leavin him, they gaʼed aff. And they send to him oʼ the Pharisees,  and they oʼ Herod, that they micht snare him in his talk. And comin to him, they say, “Maister, we ken that ye are true, and are swayed by nae man; for ye care‐na for the looks oʼ a man, but oʼ a truth are teachin the way oʼ God: Is it richt for us to pay dues to Cesar, or no? “Sal we gie, or sal we refuse?” But he, seein their fauseness, said to them, “Why‐for are ye tempin me? Schaw me a siller‐penny that I may see.” And they feshʼt it. And quoʼ he till them, “Whaʼs face and inscription is this?” And they said till him, “Cesarʼs.” And Jesus said to them, “The things oʼ Cesar aye gie ye to Cesar, and the things oʼ God to God!” And they war astonished at him. And thar cam to him the Sadducees, wha say, “Risin‐again thar is nane;” and they speirʼt at him, sayin, “Maister! Moses pat doon for us. Gin a manʼs brither dee, and leaʼ ahint a wife, and lea nae bairn, that his brither soud tak his wife, and raise up seed to his brither. “Thar war seeven brithers; and the first took a wife, and deeʼt, leaʼin nae bairn; “And the second took her; and deein, left nae bairn ahint him; and the third as weel. “And the seeven left nae bairn; and, hinmaist oʼ aʼ, the wumman deeʼt. “At the Up‐risin, than, whase wife sal she be oʼ them? for the seeven had her for wife?” Jesus said to them, “Div ye no gang wrang, for this vera cause, that ye kenna the Scripturs, and Godʼs pooer? “For whan they sal rise frae the deid, they naither mairry, nor are gien in mairriage; but are as the Angels in Heeven. “But anent the Risin‐frae‐the‐deid, did ye never read iʼ the buik oʼ Moses — ‘Anent the Buss ’ — how God spak till him, sayin, ‘I am the God oʼ Abraʼm, and God oʼ Isaac, and God oʼ Jaucob!’ “He isna the God oʼ deid men, but oʼ the leevin! Ye this way uncolie deceive yersels.” And ane oʼ the Scribes cam forrit, and heard them reasonin, and seein that he had answerʼt them weel, speirʼt at him, “Whilk is the first ane oʼ the Commandments?” Jesus answerʼt him, “The first oʼ aʼ is, ‘Hear ye, O Israʼl! the Lord oor God, the Lord, is ane: “ ‘And ye sal  loʼe the Lord yere God wiʼ aʼ yere heart, and wiʼ aʼ yere saul, and wiʼ aʼ yere mind, and wiʼ aʼ yere micht;’ this, a first commaun. “And a second like it; this: ‘Ye sal loʼe yeʼre neebor as yersel.’ Heigher than thir, oʼ commauns thar is nane!” And the Scribe said to him, “Weel, Maister; oʼ a truth said ye that he is ane, and thar is nane ither but he; “And to loʼe him wiʼ aʼ the heart, and wiʼ aʼ the understaunin, and wiʼ aʼ the saul, and wiʼ aʼ aneʼs micht — and to loʼe aneʼs neebor as aneʼs selʼ, is far mair than aʼ the hail?-?brunt offerans and sacrifeeces!” And whan Jesus saw that he answerʼt discreet, he said to him, “Ye are‐na far frae Godʼs Kingdom!” And syne eftir that, nae man daur speir at him quaistens. And Jesus answerʼt, and quoʼ he, as he was teachin iʼ the Temple, “What way say the Scribes that the Christ is Dauvidʼs son? “Dauvid his sel says, by the Holie Spirit, ‘The Lord says  to my Lord, Sit thou on my richt haun, till I mak thy faes thy fit‐brod!’ “David his sel names him ‘Lord’; and frae whaur‐awa is he than his son?” And aʼ the thrang listened to him gladly. And in his teachin, quoʼ he, “Tak tent oʼ the Scribes! wha like to gang aboot in lang goons, and loʼe compliments iʼ the merkits, “And preferred seats iʼ the kirk, and heid places at feasts: “Wha devoor weedowsʼ hames, and iʼ their deceit mak lang prayers: thir sal hae the deeper condemnation.” And he set his sel doon fornent the Treasury; and a hantle oʼ them that war rich cuist in muckle. And thar cam ane, a puir weedow; and she cuist in twa mites, that mak a fardin. And he caʼd till him his ain disciples, and quoʼ he, “Truly say I tʼye, this puir weedow has cuisten in mair than aʼ they that are castin intil the Treasury. “For aʼ they, oot oʼ their owercome hae cuisten in; but she oot oʼ her poortith did cast in aʼ she had — eʼen aʼ her leevin!” And as he gaed oot oʼ the Temple, ane oʼ his followers says, “Maister! gie tent, and see sic stanes, and unco biggins!” Jesus said to him, “Are ye lookin at thae great biggins? Thar sal‐na be left ae stane on anither that shanna be whammlʼt ower!” And as he sat on the Mount oʼ Olives, fornent the Temple, Peter and James, and John, and Andro, speirʼt at him quately, “Tell us, whan sal thir things be? And what the sign whan thir things are comin to pass?” And Jesus begude to say to them, “Tak tent that nae man lead ye a‐gley: “Mony a ane wull come in my name, sayin, ‘I am he!’ and wull gar mony gang agee. “And whan ye hear oʼ weir, and the clash aboot weir, be‐na ye putten‐aboot; for they maun needs come on; but the endin hasna come. “For nation sal rise up again nation, and kingdom again kingdom: thar sal be yirdins in a hantle places; and thar maun be famines. Thir are the bearin‐pains comin on. “But tak tent to yersels; for they wull gie ye up to hie‐cooncils and kirks; ye maun be cloured; and fornent governors and kings maun ye staun for the sake oʼ me, for a testimonie to them. “And the joyfuʼ‐tidins maun first be proclaimed to aʼ the nations. “And whan they lead ye, deliverin ye up, be‐na fashin yersels aforehaun what ye sal say; but whatsae sal be gien ye iʼ that ʼoor, that speak; for it isna ye that speak; but the Holie Spirit. “And brither wull gie up the brither to deid: and the faither the bairn; and bairns sal rise up again their parents, that they be putten to death. “And ye sal be hatit oʼ aʼ men for my sake; but wha tholes to the end, that same sal be saved. “But whaneʼer ye see the abomination oʼ the Desolation staunin whaur it soudna be (wha reads, lat him tak tent!), than lat thae wha are in Judea flee to the mountains! “And lat him wha is on the hoose‐tap no come doon intil the hoose, nor eʼen gang in to tak onything oot oʼ the hoose; “And lat him that is oot‐by iʼ the field no return back to tak awa his coat. “But wae for them that are bearin! and for them that gie the breist iʼ thae days! “And pray ye that it come‐na iʼ the winter! “For thae days sal be a time oʼ dool, sae as thar has been nane sic?-?like, sinʼ the first oʼ the creation that God creatit, eʼen till noo, and nevir sal be. “And gin the Lord shortened‐na the days, nae flesh wad be saved; but for the sake oʼ his ain, wham he waled oot for his sel, he shortens the days. “And, at that time, gin ony ane says tʼye, ‘See! here is the Christ!’ or ‘See there!’ lippen him na; “For thar sal staun up fause Christs, and fause prophets, and wull schaw tokens and wunner‐warks, that they may lead awa, gin it war possible, eʼen the chosen anes. “But tak ye tent! See, I hae tauld ye aʼ things aforehaun! “But in thae days, eftir that dool and stour, the sun sal be darkenʼt, and the mune sanna gie oot her licht, “And the starns sal faʼ frae the lift, and the pooers abune sal be shaken. “And than sal they see the Son oʼ Man comin iʼ the cluds, wiʼ unco pooer and glorie. “And than sal he send oot his Angels, and sal gaither thegither his chosen anes frae the fowr winds, frae the ootermaist pairt oʼ the yirth to the ootermaist oʼ heeven. “Noo learn ye a parable frae the fig‐tree: whaneʼer her branch is bein tenʼer, and the leaves comin on, ye ken simmer is nar‐haun; “Sae ye, whaneʼer ye see thir things comin on, tak tent that it is nar — at the vera doors! “Truly say I tʼye, this generation passes‐na awa, till aʼ thir things sal be! “Heeven and Yirth sal pass awa; but my words sal‐na pass awa! “But, oʼ that day and that ʼoor kens nane; no eʼen the angels in Heeven; nor the Son; but the Faither. “Tak ye tent! watch and pray! for ye kenna whan the time is. “As a man bidin in a far‐awa lanʼ; wha has left his hoose, and gien authoritie to his servants; to ilka ane his wark; and commandit the porter to tak gude tent; “Tak ye gude tent, thar‐for! for ye kenna whan the maister oʼ the hoose comes hame; gin it be at eʼen, or at midnicht, or at the cock crawin, or at the dawin; “Least, comin on ye oʼ a suddaintie, he find ye sleepin! “And what I say to you, I say to aʼ — tak tent! Eftir twa days was the Pasche, and the Sad Breid; and the Heigh‐priests and Scribes war coonsellin hoo they coud grip him by knaverie, and slay him. For quoʼ they, “No in the Feast; for aiblins thar wad be a bruilzie amang the folk.” And he bein in Bethanie, iʼ the hoose oʼ Simon the leper, as he was at meat,  a wumman cam, haein an alabaster oʼ perfume, raal nard, vera costly; and she brak the alabaster, and teemed it ower his heid. And thar war some wha war ill‐pleased amang theirsels; and quoʼ they, “For whatna end was the perfume wastit? “For it micht hae been sellʼt for mair nor three‐hunner pennies, and hae been gien tae the puir!” And they compleened oʼ her. But Jesus said, “Dinna fash her! Why soud ye pit her aboot? A wark ee‐sweet and bonnie has she dune in me. “For aye hae ye the puir wʼye; and, whan ye wull, ye may do them gude; but ye hae‐na aye me wiʼ ye. “She did what she was able to do; she took it aforehaun to perfume my body for the burial. “Truly say I tʼye, whaursoeʼer the Gude‐Tidins sal be cryʼt, throwe the hail warld, eʼen what she did sal be tauld for her memorial!” And Judas Iscariot gaed awa to the Heigh‐priests, that he micht deliver him up to them. And they war crouse whan they heard it, and promised him siller. And he was takin tent hoo he coud finʼ the richt time to deliver him up. And on the first day oʼ the Sad Breid, whan they aye killʼt the Paschal lamb, his disciples speirʼt at him, “Whaur wull ye that we gang and mak ready that we may eat the Pasche?” And he sends oot twa oʼ the disciples, and quoʼ he to them, “Gang yere ways intil the citie, and a man wiʼ a stoup oʼ watir sal meet ye: follow him. “And whaur he may gang in, say ye to the gudeman oʼ the hoose, ‘The Maister says, Whaur is my lodgins, whaur I may eat the Pasche wiʼ my disciples?’ “And he himsel wull schaw ye a gudely upper room, plenishʼt and ready: and thar prepare ye for us.” And the disciples gaʼed oot, and cam intil the citie, and faund as he had said to them; and they prepared the Pasche. And whan the eʼenin cam on, he comes wiʼ the Twalʼ. And as they sat and war eatin, Jesus says, “Truly say I tʼye, Ane oʼ you, wha eats wiʼ me, wull betray me!” Than begude they to be unco cuisten‐doon, and to say to him, ane by ane, “Is it I?” And he said to them, “It is ane oʼ the Twalʼ, and he wha dips wiʼ me iʼ the dish. “For the Son oʼ Man bude gang, as it is putten‐doon anent him; but wae for that man by wham the Sonʼ oʼ man is deliverʼt up: weel had it been for him gin he had nevir been born!” And as they war eatin, Jesus took breid, and whan he blessʼt, brak it, and gied it to them, and said, “Tak ye, this is my body.” And he took a cup; and giean thanks, gied it to them; and they drank oʼt. And he said to them, “This is my blude oʼ the Covenant, the blude shed for mony. “Truly say I tʼye, Nae mair sal I drink oʼ the frute oʼ the vine, until I drink it anew in the Kingdom oʼ God!” And whan they had sung the Psalm, they gaed oot intil the Mount oʼ Olives. And Jesus says to them, “Aʼ ye this nicht sal be putten‐aboot because oʼ me: for it is written, ‘I wull clour the Shepherd, and the sheep sal be skailʼt abreid.’ “But eftir my Up‐risin, I wull gang afore ye intil Galilee.” And Peter says to him, “Gin aʼ soud finʼ maitter oʼ offence, yet wull‐not I!” And Jesus says to him, “Truly say I tʼye, that you — this day, eʼen this nicht, — afore the cock craw twice, will thrice disown me!” But he threepit to him, “Gin I hae to dee wiʼ thee, Iʼll no disown thee!” and siclike said they aʼ. And they cam to a place caʼd “Gethsemanie”: and he says to his disciples, “Sit ye here, till I pray.” And he taks wiʼ him Peter, and James, and John, and begude to be in unco dool. And he says to them, “My saul is unco wae, eʼen till death! bide ye here, and tak gude tent!” And he gaed forrit a wee, and loutit doon to the grunʼ, and prayed that — gin it coud be — the ʼoor micht pass by him. And he was cryin, “Abba, Faither! Aʼ things are possible to thee! Tak awa this cup frae me!  But, it isna what I will, but what Thou wills!” And he comes, and finʼs them sleepin, and says to Peter, “Simon, are ye sleepin? Coud‐ye‐na watch ae ʼoor? “Tak tent, and pray! that ye come‐na intil temptation. The spirit is fain, but the flesh is waff.” And ance mair he gaed awa, and prayed, sayin the same words. And whan he was come back, he faund them sleepin, for that their een war unco heavy; and they kent‐na what to answer him. And he cam the third time, and says to them, “Sleep on for a wee, and rest. It is eneuch! The time has come! See! the Son oʼ Man is deliverʼt up intil the hauns oʼ the wicked! “Rise! lat us be gaun. Mark! he wha delivers me up is at haun!” And at ance, eʼen while he yet spak, comes Judas, ane oʼ the Twalʼ, and wiʼ him a great thrang wiʼ swords and rungs, frae the Heid‐priests and Elders. And he wha was deliverin him up had gien them a token; quoʼ he, “Wham I kiss, that is he; grip him, and lead him awa siccar!” And comin, he gaes straucht to him, and says, “Maister, Maister!” and kissʼt him. And they lay hauns on him, and made him siccar. But ane that stude by, drew sword, and attackit the Heid‐priestʼs servin‐man, and strack aff his lug. And Jesus answerʼt them, “Are ye come oot, as again a robber, wiʼ swords and rungs to tak me? “I was day by day wiʼ ye iʼ the Temple, and ye grippit‐me‐na; but it is that sae the Scriptur micht be fulfilled.” And they aʼ desertit him and fled. And a young man cam followin wiʼ them, haein a linen claith thrawn rounʼ his body; and they took haud oʼ him. But he left the claith wiʼ them, and escapit nakit. And they led Jesus aff till the Heigh‐priest; and thar war gaitherʼt thegither aʼ the Heid‐priests and the Elders and the Doctors. And Peter had followʼt far ahint, eʼen intil the coort‐yaird oʼ the Heigh‐priest: and he sat wiʼ the servants, and warmed his sel at the lowe. Noo the Heid‐priests and aʼ the Cooncil socht for prufe again Jesus, for to pit him to deid: but coudna finʼ ony. For mony bure fause‐witness again him; but their tales wadna ʼgree thegither. And some stude up, and testifyʼt fausely again him, sayin, “We heard him say, ‘I wull puʼ doon this Temple — this made wiʼ hauns — and in thrie days Iʼse bigg anither, no made wiʼ hauns!’ ” And no eʼen sae was their testimonie agreein. And the Heigh‐priest, risin in the mids, speirʼt at Jesus, sayin, “Div ye answer nocht? What are thir testifyin again ye?” But he stude quate, and said nocht. Again the Heigh‐priest speirʼt at him, “Are ye the Anointit, the Son oʼ the Blessed?” And Jesus said, “I am; and yeʼse see the Son oʼ Man sittin on the richt haun oʼ Pooer, and comin iʼ the cluds oʼ heeven!” And the Heigh‐priest rived his cleedin, and cryʼt he, “What need we ony mair testimonie? “Ye hae heard the wicked words: what think ye?” And they aʼ condemned him to be wordie oʼ death. And some begude to spit on him; and hid his face and daddit him, sayin, “Prophesie!” And the servitors dang him wiʼ their looves. And as Peter was aneath iʼ the coort‐yaird, thar comes ane oʼ the maids oʼ the Heigh‐priest. And whan she saw Peter warmin his sel, she narrowly looks at him, and quoʼ she, “And thou was wiʼ the Nazarine — wiʼ Jesus!” But he denyʼt, sayin, “I ken‐na him! nor ken I what yeʼre sayin!” And he gaed oot‐by intil the entry; and a cock crew. And the maid saw him again; and begude to say to them staunnin aboot, “This is ane oʼ them!” And he denyʼt it again. And a wee while eftir, they staunnin by say to Peter, “Truly ye are ane oʼ them; for ye are a Galilee‐man!” But he begude bannin and sweirin — “I ken‐na the man ye speak oʼ!” And noo the second time a cock crew. And Peter caʼd to mind what Jesus said to them, “Before the cock craw twice, thou wull disown me thrice!” And whan he thocht thar‐on, he grat. And straucht the Heid‐priests iʼ the mornin coonsellʼt wiʼ the Elders and Doctors, and the hail Cooncil, and bund Jesus, and led him awa and deliverʼt him up to Pilate. And Pilate speirʼt at him, “Are ye the King oʼ the Jews?” And answerin, he says to him, “Ye say true.” And the Heid‐priests threepit on mony things again him. And Pilate again speirʼt at him, “Answer‐ye‐na? See! hoo mony things they lay again ye!” But Jesus nae mair answerʼt ocht; sae that Pilate ferlied. Noo, at Feast‐time, he aye releasʼt for them a prisoner — wham they micht wale. And thar was ane Barabbas; bund wiʼ the insurgents — wha, indeed, in the revolt had committit murder. And aʼ the folk gaed up, and begude to seek for him to dae as he had aye done for them. And Pilate answerʼt them, “Wad ye that I release tʼye the King oʼ the Jews?” For he saw that for jealousie the Heid‐priests had deliverʼt him up. But the Heid‐priests wrocht up the folk, that he soud raither release them Barabbas. And Pilate was again speirin at them, “What, than, wad ye that I soud do to the King oʼ the Jews?” But they cryʼt oot again, “Crucify him!” But Pilate said to them, “Why sae? What ill has he dune?” And they cryʼt oot mair furiously, “Crucify him!” And Pilate, being fain to please the crood, released Barabbas to them; and deliverʼt  up Jesus, first bein scourged, to be crucifyʼt. And the sodgers led him awa intil the coort, caʼd “The Pretorium;” and they bring thegither the hail cohort. And they cleed him in purple, and they weave a croon oʼ thorns, and pit it on his heid; And begude to salute him, “Hail to thee, King oʼ the Jews!” And they strack him ower the heid wiʼ a reed; and spat on him, and bent the knee and worshippʼt him. And eftir mockin him, they strippit aff the purple, and pat on him his ain cleedin, and led him oot to crucify him. And they lay haud oʼ ane Simon, a Cyrenian, comin in frae the kintra‐pairts — faither oʼ Alexander and Rufus — to carry his cross. And they bring him to the place “Golgotha,” that is to say “Skull‐place.” And they profferʼt him wine wiʼ myrr inʼt; but he wadna haeʼt. And they crucifyʼt him; and dividit his cleedin amang them, and cuist lots wha soud hae ocht. And it was the third ʼoor, and they crucifyʼt him. And the writin oʼ his accusation was ower aboon, “The King oʼ the Jews!” And eke wiʼ him they crucify twa robbers; ane on the richt haun, and ane on his left. And the Scriptur cam to pass, whilk says, “And wiʼ wrang‐doers was he coontit‐in!” And the gangers‐by war miscaʼin him, waggin their heids, and sayin, “Aha! thou wha is takin doon the Temple, and up‐biggin it in thrie days. “Save yersel, and come doon frae the cross!” And as weel the Heid‐priests, jeerin amang their sels, wiʼ the Writers, said, “He saved ithers; his sel he canna save! “The Christ, the King oʼ Israʼl! lat him noo come doon frae the cross, that seein it, we may lippen him!” And the anes crucifyʼt wiʼ him, miscaʼd him. And at the mid‐day ʼoor, the mirk cam ower the hail lanʼ, to the ninth ʼoor oʼ the day. And at the ninth ʼoor, Jesus cryʼt oot wiʼ a loud voice, “Eloi! Eloi! lama sabachthani!” whilk is, in translation, “My God! My God! why did thou forsake me?” And some oʼ the staunners‐by, whan they heard that, said, “He cries on Elijah!” And ane ran and filled a sponge wiʼ vinegar, and pat it on a reed, and gied him drink, sayin, “Lat be! let us see gin aiblins Elijah comes to tak him doon!” But Jesus, utterin a lood cry, expirʼt. And the veil oʼ the Temple was rived in twa, frae the tap to the bottom. Noo the Captain wha stude nar, fornent him, seein he sae cryʼt oot and expirʼt, said, “Truly, this man was Godʼs Son!” And weemen too war thar, lookin on frae oot‐by: ʼmang wham war Mary Magdalene, and Mary (James the less, and Joseʼs mither), and Salome, Wha, whan he was in Galilee, aye followʼt and providit for him; and mony ither weemen wha cam up wiʼ him to Jerusalem. And gloamin comin on, and it bein “The Preparation,” that is “Afore the Sabbath,” — Thar cam  Joseph of Arithmathea, a Cooncillor oʼ honorable rank, wha himsel lookit for the Kingdom oʼ God, and gaed openly to Pilate, and craved the body oʼ Jesus. And Pilate misdootit whether he was sae sune deid; and caʼd the Captain, and speirʼt at him gin he had been ony time deid? And as sune as he kent it oʼ the Captain, he grantit the body to Joseph. And he coft fine linen, and takin him doon, rowʼt him iʼ the claith, and laid him in a tomb hewn oot iʼ the rock: and rowʼt a muckle stane to steek the door oʼ the tomb. And Mary Magdalene, and Mary, Jamesʼ mither, lookit on, and saw whaur he was laid. The Sabbath bein by, Mary Magdalene, and Mary oʼ James, and Salome, coft them spices, that they micht come and anoint him. And early on the first day oʼ the week, they come to the tomb, at the sun‐risin. “And they war sayin to thir sels, “Wha wull row us awa the stane frae the door oʼ the tomb?” And, lookin up, they see that the stane is rowʼt awaʼ; for it was an unco bouk. And, gangin intil the tomb, they saw a young man sittin on the richt, clad in a lang, white robe; and they war unco fleyʼt. But he says to them, “Be na fleyʼt! Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the Crucifyʼt. He raise! He isna here! See the place whaur they laid him. “But gang; tell his disciples and Peter,  that he gaes afore you intil Galilee, thar sal ye see him; eʼen as he tauld ye.” And gangin oot, they fled frae the tomb; for fear and quakin had come on them; and they tauld nocht to ony; for they war terrifyʼt. And, comin forth early on the first day oʼ the week, he was first made kent to Mary Magdalene, frae wham he had cuisten oot seeven demons. She gaed awaʼ and tellʼt thae that had been wiʼ him, as they maenʼd and grat. And they, whan they war tellʼt that he was leevin, and seen by her, wadna believe. And eftir thae things, he was schawn in anither form to twa oʼ them, as they walkit and gaed oot intil the kintra. And they gaed awaʼ, and tellʼt it to the lave: neither believʼt they them. But eftir, to the Eleeven their sels he was schawn, as they sat at meat; and he wytit them for their dootsomness and hardness oʼ heart, no to lippen to them wha had seen him eftir he raise. And he said to them, “Gang ye to aʼ the warld, and preach the Gude‐Tidins to the hale creation! “Wha believes and is bapteezʼt sal be savʼt; but wha disbelieves sal be condemned. “And uncos sal follow them that believe; in my name sal the demons be cuisten oot; they sal speak wiʼ tongues; “They sal tak up vipers; and gin aiblins they drink ony deidly draught, it sal be nae ill to them; they sal lay hauns on the sick, and they sal be weel!” Sae than the Lord Jesus, eftir he had spoken to them, was taʼen up till Heeven, and sat doon on the richt haun oʼ God: And they gaed oot, and preached aʼ‐gate; the Lord workin wiʼ them, and makin siccar the Word wiʼ the uncos that followʼt. Inasmuckle as mony hae taen in haun to pit doon in order a narration oʼ thae things that hae been made siccar amang us, Eʼen as they, wha war at first‐haun witnesses and followers oʼ the Word, gied them till us; It seemed gude to me as weel, haein kent frae the first aʼ things perfetely, to write to you in set order, O weel‐deservin Theophilus, That ye micht hae fuʼ knowledge oʼ the certaintie oʼ the things in whilk ye hae been trained. Thar was, in the days oʼ Herod, King oʼ Judea, a priest caʼd Zachariah, oʼ Abijahʼs coorse; and his wife was oʼ the dochters oʼ Aaron, and she was caʼd Elizabeth. And they war baith richt‐leevin afore God, walkin iʼ the Commauns and appointments oʼ the Lord wyteless. And they had nae bairn, for that Elizabeth bure‐na; and they war baith growin auld. Noo it came aboot, that while he was doin priestly service afore God iʼ the order oʼ his coorse, As was the custom oʼ the priesthood, it was his lot to offer incense, enterin intil the Temple oʼ the Lord. And the thrang oʼ folk were oot‐by, prayin, at the ʼoor oʼ the incense‐offeran. And thar appearʼt to him an Angel oʼ the Lord, staunin on the richt side oʼ the incense‐altar. And Zachariah was uncolie putten‐aboot whan he saw him, and fear cam on him. But the Angel says to him, “Be‐na fleyt, Zachariah! for yere prayer has been heard, and yere wife Elizabeth sal bear a son tʼye, and his name yeʼse caʼ  John “And ye sal hae joy to ye, and rejoicin, and mony sal be blythe at his birth. “For he sal be michty afore the Lord, and heʼse drink nae wine nor strong drink; and he sal be fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, eʼen frae the womb. “And mony oʼ Israʼlʼs sons wull he weise rounʼ till the Lord their God. “And he sal gang afore him iʼ the spirit and micht oʼ Elijah to weise rounʼ faithersʼ hearts till their bairns, and the dour to the wyss‐heid oʼ the gude; to mak ready for the Lord a prepared folk.” And Zachariah says to the Angel, “Hooʼs I to ken this? For Iʼm an auld man, and my wife noo in eild?” And answerin, quoʼ the Angel to him, “I am Gabriel, that staun afore God! and I hae been sent te speak to ye, and to fesh ye thir gude tidins. “And noo see! ye sal be dumb, and hae nae speech, until whatna day thir things are dune, for that ye wadna lippen my words — whilk sal come to pass iʼ their time!” And the folk war waitin for Zachariah, and ferlied at his delayin iʼ the Temple. And whan he cam forth, he coudna speak to them; and they kent he bude hae seen a vision iʼ the Temple. And he gaed on makin signs to them, and remained dumb. And it cam aboot, that whan his days oʼ service war dune, he gaed awa to his ain hoose. And eftir thae days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and wadna be seen for fyve months; sayin, “Sae has the Lord dune to me, to tak awa my humiliation amang the folk.” And iʼ the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent frae God till a citie oʼ Galilee caʼd Nazareth, Till a maid betrothed to a man named Joseph, oʼ the hoose oʼ Dauvid; and the maidʼs name was Mary. And the Angel, comin in till her, says, “Joy be to ye, favored ane! The Lord is wʼye; blest be ye amang weemen!” But she was unco put‐aboot at the sayin, and was comin ower in her mind whatna kind oʼ salutation this micht be! And the Angel said, “Fear‐na, Mary! for ye hae gotten favor wiʼ God! “And tak tent! ye sal conceive iʼ the womb, and bring forth a son, and sal caʼ his name JESUS. “He sal be great, anʼ sal be caʼd ‘The Son oʼ the Maist Heigh;’ and the Lord sal gie to him the thron oʼ his faither Dauvid. “And he sal reign ower the hoose oʼ Jaucob for aye: and oʼ his kingdom sal be nae endin!” But Mary said to the Angel, “Hoo sal this be, sin a husband I ken‐na?” And the Angel answerin, says, “The Holie Spirit sal come, and the pooer oʼ the Maist Heigh sal descend upon ye; and sae that that is to be born sal be caʼd holie, the Son oʼ God! “And mark! Elizabeth, yere kinswumman, eʼen she has conceived a son in her auld age; and this is the saxth month wiʼ her wha was coontit bairnless. “For nae word frae God sal want pooer!” And Mary said, “Lo! I am the handmaid oʼ the Lord.  Be it eʼen to me, conform to thy word!” And the Angel gaed awa frae her. And iʼ thae days, Mary raise, and gaed intil the hill‐kintra wiʼ haste, intil a citie oʼ Judah; And enterʼt intil the hoose oʼ Zechariah, and salutit Elizabeth. And it cam aboot that as Elizabeth heard Maryʼs salutation, the bairn in her womb rejoiced; and Elizabeth was fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, And raised her voice in lood exclamation, and said, “Happy ye amang weemen! and blest is the frute oʼ yere womb! “And for what is this come to me, that the mither oʼ my Lord soud come tae me? “For behauld! as sune as the voice oʼ yere salutation cam to my hearin, the bairn lap iʼ my womb for joy. “And happy she wha lippenʼd! for thar sal be comin to pass oʼ thae things spoken to her frae the Lord.” And Mary said, “My saul dis magnify the Lord, “And my spirit joys in God my Saviour! “For he has lookit upon the laigh estate oʼ his handmaid; for lo! frae this oot, aʼ generations sal caʼ me blest, “For that the Michty Ane has dune to me great things; and Holie is his name! “And his mercie is until generations and generations, to thae that fear him. “He wrocht victorie wiʼ his airm; he dang them that war heigh iʼ their heartʼs intent. “He puʼd doon michty anes frae throns, and liftit up thae oʼ laigh estate. “To hungry anes he gied rowth oʼ gude things; and the walthy he caʼd awa toom; “He helpit Israʼl, his servitor, and rememberʼt his mercie, “As he spak to oor faithers, to Abraʼm and his seed for aye!” And Mary bidit wiʼ her for aboot thrie months; and returnʼt to her ain hoose. Noo Elizabethʼs time oʼ bringin‐forth was come; and she bure a son. And her neebors and kin heard hoo the Lord had multiplyʼt his mercies to her, and they rejoiced wiʼ her. And it cam aboot, that on the auchth day they cam to circumceese the bairn; and they wad hae him caʼd “Zachariah,” eftir the name oʼ his faither. And his mither answerʼt, “Na, but he sal be caʼd  John ! ” And they said to her, “Nane oʼ yer kin is caʼd by this name!” And they made signs to his faither, “Hoo wad ye hae him caʼd?” And he wad hae a writin‐tablet, and wrate, “His name is John!” And aʼ ferlied. And his mouʼ was unsteekit at ance, and his tongue lowsed; and he spak, and praised God. And fear fell on aʼ the neebors; and this was noised abreid ower the hill‐pairt of Judea. And aʼ wha heard it laid it up in their hearts, sayin, “Whatna bairn sal this be?” for the haun oʼ the Lord was wiʼ him. And his faither Zachariah was fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, and prophesyʼt, sayin, “Blest be the Lord God oʼ Israʼl, wha has regairdit his ain folk, and wrocht salvation for them! “And has raised up a horn oʼ Salvation for us in the hoose oʼ his servant Dauvid: “As he spak by the word oʼ the prophets, wha hae been sinʼ the beginnin, “Salvation frae our faes, and frae the haun oʼ aʼ that hate us. “To schaw mercie to oor faithers, and to keep in mind his holie Covenant: “The aith he swure to Abraʼm oor faither, “To grant to us, that, deliverin us frae the haun oʼ oor faes, we soud serʼ him wiʼ nae dreid, “In holiness and richtousness aʼ the days oʼ oor leevin. “And ye, bairn, sal be caʼd the Prophet oʼ the Maist Heigh; for ye sal gang on afore him, to mak ready his gangins; “To gie knowledge oʼ salvation to his folk, for the remittin oʼ their sins, “For that Godʼs yearnin mercie is toward us, whaur‐by the dawin frae on heigh sal find us, “To glint on them wha sit in darkness, and the gloamin oʼ death; to airt oor feet intil the ways oʼ peace!” And the bairn grew, and waxʼd sterk in spirit, and was iʼ the deserts to the day he was made kent to Israʼl. Noo iʼ thae days it cam aboot thar gaed oot a decree frae Cesar Augustus that aʼ the inhabiters oʼ his dominions soud be enrolled. And this enrollment was made whan Quirinius was Governor in Syria. And aʼ war gaun to be enrolled, ilk ane to his ain citie. And Joseph, as weel, gaed up frae Galilee, oot oʼ the citie oʼ Nazareth, intil Judea, intil Dauvidʼs citie, whilk is caʼd Bethlehem; for that he was oʼ the hoose and stock oʼ Dauvid: To be enrolled, wiʼ Mary his betrothed wife, wha was a mither‐to‐be. And sae it was, that while they war thar, the days war fulfilled for her to bring forth. And she brocht forth her son — her first‐born — and rowʼt him in a barrie‐coat, and laid him iʼ the manger, for that there was nae room for them iʼ the inn. And thar war in the same kintra side herds bidin iʼ the fields, and keepin gaird ower their flocks by nicht. And see! an Angel oʼ the Lord cam till them, and the glorie oʼ the Lord glintit roond aboot them; and they war sair gliffʼd. And the Angel said, “Be‐na gliffʼd; for I bring ye gude tidins oʼ muckle joy to the hail warld! “For thar is born tʼye this day, in Dauvidʼs toun, a Saviour, wha is the Anointit Lord. “And here is the token for ye: yeʼse finʼ the bairn rowʼt in a barrie‐coat, lyin in a manger.” And aʼ at ance there was wiʼ the Angel a thrang oʼ Heevenʼs host, praisin God, and sayin, “Glorie to God iʼ the heighest heights, and on the yirth peace! Gude wull to men!” And as the Angels gaed awa frae them to Heeven, the shepherds said one to anither, “Let us gang noo to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come aboot, that the Lord has made kent to us!” And they gaed, makin haste, and fund Mary, and Joseph, and the bairn lyin in a manger. And whan they saw it, they tauld abreid the words that war tellʼt to them anent this bairn. And aʼ that heard it ferlied at the things tauld them by the shepherds. But Mary keepit aʼ thae things, pondering on them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, giean glorie to God, for aʼ thae things they saw and heard; eʼen as it was tellʼt them. And whan the auchth day was come for the circumceesion oʼ the bairn, his name they caʼd JESUS, whilk was sae caʼd by the Angel ʼor he was conceivʼt iʼ the womb. And whan the days oʼ purification by the law oʼ Moses war fulfilled, they took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord; Eʼen as it is putten‐doon iʼ the law oʼ the Lord, “Ilka male that opes a womb sal be caʼd holie to the Lord.” And to offer an offeran, as it is putten‐doon iʼ the law oʼ the Lord, “A pair oʼ cushats, or twa young doos.” And mark! thar was a man iʼ Jerusalem, whase name was Simeon; and this man was holie and devout, lookinʼ for Israʼlʼs consolation. And the Holie Spirit was on him. And the Holie Spirit had made kent to him that he soudna see death till he had seen the Anointit oʼ the Lord. And he cam iʼ the Spirit, intil the Temple; and whan the parents brocht in the bairn Jesus, to do for him what was the custom oʼ the Law, He took him in his airms, and praised God, and said, “Noo, wull thou dismiss thy servant, O Lord! conform to thy word, in peace! “For my een hae seen thy salvation, “Whilk thou hast brocht forrit afore the face oʼ aʼ folk. “A licht for unveilin to the Gentiles, and a glorie for thy folk oʼ Israʼl!” And Joseph and his mither ferlied at aʼ the things that war said anent him. And Simeon blessʼt them, and said to Mary his mither, “Lo! this Ane is set for the faʼin and staunin again oʼ mony in Israʼl: and for a sign to be miscaʼd. “And a sword sal thring throwe yere ain heart as weel, that the thochts oʼ mony hearts may be schawn.” “And thar was ane Anna, a prophetess, Phanuelʼs dochter, oʼ the tribe oʼ Asher; she was oʼ an unco age, and had leevʼd wiʼ a husband seeven year frae her maidenhood: And she bade a weedow for four‐score and four year, wha left‐na the Temple; and serʼt wiʼ fastins and prayers nicht and day: And she too comin in at that time gied thanks to God; and spak oʼ him to aʼ wha war waitin for the deliverin oʼ Jerusalem. And whan they had dune aʼ things conform to the law oʼ the Lord, they gaed awa intil Galilee, to their ain citie Nazareth. And the bairn grew, and waxʼt strang; fuʼ oʼ wisdom; and Godʼs tender favor was wiʼ him. Noo his parents gaed yearly to Jerusalem, at the Feast oʼ the Pasche. And whan he was twal‐year auld, they gaed up to Jerusalem, as was the mainner oʼ the Feast. And whan they had fulfilled the days, they returned; but the lad Jesus remained ahint in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mither kent‐na. But, supposin him to be wiʼ the ithers oʼ the company, gaed a dayʼs journey, and they socht him amang their kin and acquaintance. And whan they faund‐him‐na, they gaed back to Jerusalem again, seekin him. And eftir thrie days they faund him iʼ the Temple, sittin wiʼ the Doctors, baith hearin them and speirin quaistens at them. And aʼ that heard him war astonished ayont aʼ things at his wisdom and his sayins. And seein him, they ferlied uncolie; and his mother says to him, “Son, why hae ye dune this till us? See! yere faither and I hae lookit for ye in pain!” And he said, “Hoo isʼt that ye socht for me? Wist‐ye‐na, I maun needs be iʼ my Faitherʼs hoose?” And they kent‐na the meanin oʼ what he spak to them. And he gaed doon wiʼ them, and cam till Nazareth, and obeyʼt them; but his mither laid  up aʼ thae things in her heart. And Jesus waxʼt in wyssheid, and in stature, and in favor wiʼ God and wiʼ man. Noo, iʼ the fifteenth year oʼ the rule oʼ Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate bein Governor oʼ Judea, and Herod Tetrarch oʼ Galilee; Philip, his brither, bein Tetrarch oʼ the kintra oʼ Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanius Tetrarch oʼ Abilene, Iʼ the Heigh‐priesthood oʼ Annas and Caiaphas, the word oʼ God cam to John, Zachariahʼs son, iʼ the muirlands. And he cam till aʼ pairts aboot Jordan, preachin repentance‐baptism, and remittin oʼ sins. As it is putten‐doon iʼ the buik oʼ the sayins oʼ Esaiah the prophet, “The sough oʼ ane cryin oot iʼ the muirlands, ‘Mak ye gangable the Lordʼs way! mak straucht his fit‐roads.’ “Ilka heugh sal be filled heigh; and ilka mountain and hill sal be made laigh, and the gleyʼt sal be made straucht, and the rouch ways plain; “And aʼ flesh sal look on Godʼs salvation!” Sae he was sayin to the thrangs that gaed oot to be bapteezʼt by him, “Ye brood oʼ vipers! wha wasʼt that warned you to flee frae the comin wrath? “Bring ye than forth frutes fit for repentance; and begin‐na to say wiʼ yersels, ‘We hae a faither, eʼen Abraʼm!’ For say I tʼye, that God coud raise up oʼ thae stanes bairns till Abraʼm! “And eʼen noo the axe is by the rute oʼ the trees: ilka tree bringin‐na forth gude fruit is cuttit doon, and cuisten intil the lowe.” And the thrang oʼ folk war speirin at him, “What than, sal we do?” And he answerʼt, “He that has twa coats, lat him bestow on him that has nane: and he that has meat, lat him dae the same.” Than cam tax‐men to be bapteezʼt, and said to him, “Maister! what are we to do?” And he says to them, “Tak frae the folk nae mair than what is set for ye!” And sodgers, too, war speirin at him, “And we, what sal we do?” And he said to them, “Lift the strang haun to nane, naither grip aucht wrangously; and be content wiʼ yere providin.” Noo, as aʼ the folk war lookin forrit, and war switherin iʼ their hearts aboot John, gin aiblins he micht be the Messiah; John answerʼt, sayin till ane‐and‐aʼ, “I, indeed, bapteeze ye wiʼ watir; but Ane comes wha is michtier than I; the whang oʼ whase shoon I am‐na fit to lout doon and lowse. He sal bapteeze ye wiʼ Holie Spirit and wiʼ fire. “Whase fan is in his neive, and he will redd up his threshin‐floor, and teem his wheat intil his girnal, but the cauff will he burn wiʼ nevir‐endin lowe!” Wiʼ mony mair exhortins was he deliverin the Gude‐tidins to the people. But Herod, the King‐depute, being repruvʼd by him anent Herodias, his brother Philipʼs wife, and for aʼ the mony ills Herod had dune, Addit this tillʼt aʼ, that he cuist John in prison. Noo, it was, that whan aʼ the folk war bapteezʼt, Jesus too was bapteezʼt, and continued in prayer — and the heevens war unsteekit, And the Holie Spirit cam doon in bodily form like a doo upon him; and a voice cam oot oʼ the heevens, “Thou art my Son, the Beloved Ane; in Thee I delicht!” And Jesus was, at the first, aboot thretty years oʼ age; bein son — as was believʼt — oʼ Joseph,  oʼ Heli, Oʼ Matthat, oʼ Levi, oʼ Melchi, oʼ Jannai, oʼ Joseph, Oʼ Mattathias, oʼ Amos, oʼ Nahum, oʼ Esli, oʼ Naggai, Oʼ Maath, oʼ Mattathias, oʼ Semein, oʼ Josech, oʼ Joda, Oʼ Joanan, oʼ Rhesa, oʼ Zerubbabel, oʼ Shealtiel, oʼ Neri, Oʼ Melchi, oʼ Addi, oʼ Cosam, oʼ Elmadam, oʼ Er, Oʼ Jesus, oʼ Eliezer, oʼ Jorim, oʼ Matthat, oʼ Levi, Oʼ Symeon, oʼ Judas, oʼ Joseph, oʼ Jonam, oʼ Eliakim, Oʼ Melea, oʼ Menna, oʼ Mattatha, oʼ Nathan, oʼ Dauvid. Oʼ Jesse, oʼ Obed, oʼ Boaz, oʼ Salmon, oʼ Nahshon, Oʼ Amminadab, oʼ Arni, oʼ Esrom, oʼ Perez, oʼ Judah, Oʼ Jaucob, oʼ Isaac, oʼ Abraʼm, oʼ Terah, oʼ Nahor, Oʼ Serug, oʼ Reu, oʼ Peleg, oʼ Eber, oʼ Shelah, Oʼ Cainan, oʼ Arphaxad, oʼ Shem, oʼ Noah, oʼ Lamech, Oʼ Methusalah, oʼ Enoch, oʼ Jared, oʼ Mahalaleel, oʼ Cainan, Oʼ Enos, oʼ Seth, oʼ Adam, oʼ GOD. And Jesus, fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, cam again frae the Jordan, and was led to the wilderness by the Spirit, forty days. Bein tempit by Sautan. And naething did he eat iʼ thae days; and eftir, he was hungerin. And the deevil said to him, “Gin ye be Godʼs Son, speak to this stane, that it may turn to a bannock!” And Jesus made answer to him, “It is putten‐doon, ‘Man leeves‐na on breid alane, but on ilka word oʼ God!’ ” And he led him up, and pointit oot till him aʼ the kingdoms oʼ the yirth, in a moment oʼ time. And the deevil says to him, “To thee wull I gie aʼ this rule — aʼthegither — and the glorie (for it has been gien up to me; and I gie it till wham I wull). “Gin aiblins thou worship me, aʼ sal be thine!” And makin answer to him, Jesus says, “It is putten‐doon, ‘Ye sal worship the Lord yere God, and to him alane sal ye do service!” And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on a towerickie oʼ the Temple, and says to him, “Lout yersel doon; “For it is putten‐doon, ‘He sal gie his Angels chairge ower ye, to defend ye; “ ‘And iʼ their hauns sal they uphaud ye, that ye ding‐na yere fit on a stane!’ ” And answerin, quoʼ Jesus to him, “It is said, ‘Ye sanna temp’ the Lord yere God!’ ” And, endinʼ aʼ his temptations, the deevil depairtit frae him till anither time. And Jesus came back iʼ the Spiritʼs pooer to Galilee; and a din gaed oot aboot him aʼ throwe the hail kintra rounʼ. And he was teachin iʼ their kirks, bein mickle thocht oʼ by them aʼ. And he cam intil Nazareth, whaur he had been brocht up; and gaed in, as he aye did, to the kirk, on the Sabbath day, and stude up to read; And thar was gien to him the buik oʼ Esaiah the Prophet; and openin the buik, he faund whaur it was putten‐doon, “The Spirit oʼ the Lord is on me, for that he has anointit me to preach gude tidins to the puir; he has sent me to tell oot their release to the prisoners, and to the blinʼ receivin oʼ sicht; to send awa free thae that war wranged. “To soond oot the blessed day oʼ the Lord!” And closin the buik, he gied it again to the beadle, and sat doon; and aʼ een iʼ the kirk war on him. And he begude to say to them, “This day is this writin come to pass iʼ yere hearin!” And aʼ war witnesses to him, and ferlyin at the words oʼ grace faʼin frae his mouʼ; and war sayin, “Isna this Josephʼs son?” And he says to them, “Ye wull, oʼ a surety say to me, ‘Physician, heal yersel! As mony things as we heard oʼ bein dune at Capernaum, do here as weel, iʼ yere ain kintra‐side!’ ” And quoʼ he, “Truly say I tʼye, nae prophet is honored in his ain kintra‐side!” “But truly I tell ye, thar war mony weedows in Israʼl iʼ the days oʼ Elijah, whan the heevens war steekit thrie year and sax months; and a great dearth cam on aʼ the lanʼ. “And to nane oʼ them was Elijah sent, but only until Sarepta oʼ Sidon, to a wumman, a weedow. “And thar war mony lepers in Israʼl, iʼ the time oʼ Elisha the prophet; and no ane oʼ them was made clean but Naaman the Syrian.” And aʼ iʼ the kirk war fuʼ oʼ rage, when they heard thir things; And they raise up to cuist him oot oʼ the citie; and they led him till the brow oʼ the hill on whilk their citie was biggit, that he micht be cuisten doon heidlang. But he, gangin oot throwe amang them, gaed his ways. And he cam doon till Capernaum, a citie oʼ Galilee, and was teachin them on the Sabbath‐days; And they war astonishʼt at his teachin; for his word cam wiʼ pooer. And iʼ the kirk was a man wiʼ a foul spirit; and he cryʼt oot wiʼ a great voice, Sayin, “Lat us be! What is thar atween us and thee, Jesus oʼ Nazareth? Are ye come to destroy us? I ken ye — the Holie Ane oʼ God!” And Jesus challenged him, “Peace! And come ye oot oʼ him!” And whan the demon had thrawn him doon, he cam oot oʼ him, doin him nae ill. And astonishment cam on them. And they war sayin ane to anither, “Whatna word is this, that wiʼ authoritie and pooer he gies orders to foul spirits, and they come oot?” And thar was gaun forth a great clash anent him, intil ilka place oʼ the kintra‐side. And, risin frae the kirk, he entered intil Simonʼs hoose. Noo Simonʼs gude‐mither was in sair pyne wiʼ a great fivver. And they spak to him for her. And, staunin ower her, he rebukit the fivver, and it gaed frae her; and she raise, and waitit on them. And whan the sun was  settin aʼ the folk, as mony as had sick anes wiʼ ony kind oʼ illness, brocht them till him, and he laid hauns on them, and healed them. And the demons too war gaun forth oʼ mony — cryin oot and sayin, “Ye are the Son oʼ God!” And he rebukit them; and allowʼt‐them‐na to speak; for they kent he was the Messiah. And whan it was day, he gaed oot and journeyʼd intil a desert bit; and the thrangs cam eftir him, and held him back, that he soudna gang frae them. But he said to them, “Till ither cities, as weel, maun I gie the Gude‐tidins anent the Kingdom oʼ God, for for that was I sent.” And he was haudin forth iʼ the kirks oʼ Galilee. Noo it cam aboot, as the folk panged aboot him to hear Godʼs word, he stude by Gennesaret Loch. And saw twa boats lying by the Loch; but the fishers war gane frae them, and war syndin their nets. And gaun intil ane oʼ the boats — whilk was Simonʼs — he wad hae him pit aff a wee frae the lanʼ; and sittin doon, he was teachin the thrang oot oʼ the boat. And whan he quat speakin, he says to Simon. “Pit oot intil the deep, and lat doon yere nets for a haul.” And answerin, Simon says to him, “Maister! though we toiled aʼ nicht, we tuik naething; yet at thy sayin I wull lat doon the nets!” And whan they did this, they took an unco number oʼ fish; and their nets war giean way. And they made signs to their pairtners iʼ the ither boat, to come and gie them a haun. And they cam; and they filled fuʼ baith the boats, sae that they war like to sink. And Simon Peter, whan he saw, fell doon at Jesusʼ knees, cryin, “Depairt frae me, for I am a sinfuʼ man, O Lord!” For amazement overcam him, and aʼ that war wiʼ him, on accoont oʼ the haul oʼ fish they tuik. And eʼen sae wiʼ baith James and John, Zebedeeʼs sons, wha war pairtners wiʼ Simon. And Jesus says to Simon, “Fear‐na! Frae this time ye sal tak men!” And, bringin their boats to the lanʼ, they left aʼ and followʼt him. And it cam aboot, that being in a certain citie, look ye! a man fuʼ oʼ leprosie; and haein sicht oʼ Jesus, he fell doon on his face, and cryʼt oot, “Lord! gin thou be willin, thou can mak me weel!” And he raxʼt oot his haun, sayin, “I wull! Be clean!” And at ance the leprosie gaed frae him. And he chairged him to tell nane; “but gang, schaw yersel to the priest, and gie for yere recoverin what Moses enjoined, for a token to them.” But the word aboot him spread sae muckle the mair; and unco thrangs cam thegither to hear him, and to be recoverʼt oʼ their ills. But he was retirin to the wilderness, and prayin. And it cam aboot on ane oʼ thae days, that he was teachin, and thar war sittin Pharisees and Writers, wha war come oot oʼ ilka toun oʼ Galilee and Judea, and Jerusalem; and the Lordʼs pooer was thar to heal them. And look! they fesh on a couch a man wiʼ a stroke; and they socht to fesh him in, and lay him doon afore Him. And no kennin hoo they coud bring him in, on accoont oʼ the thrang, they gaed up on the hoose‐tap, and throwe the tilin they loutit him doon, wiʼ his couch, iʼ the mids, afore Jesus. And seein their lealness, he says to him, “Man, yere sins are forgien ye!” And the Writers and the Pharisees begude to dispute, “Wha is this utterin profaneness? Wha can forgie sins but God allenar?” But Jesus kennin their thochts, says to them, “Why are ye debatin iʼ yere hearts? “Whilk is easier to say, ‘Yeʼre sins are forgienʼ: or to say, ‘Rise ye and walk’? “But in order ye may ken that the Son oʼ Man has authoritie on the yirth to forgie sins,” [he says to the paralytic], “Rise! and takin up yere couch, gang yere ways till yere hame!” And at ance, afore them aʼ, risin, and liftin that whaur‐on he lay, he gaed aff to his ain hoose, giean glorie to God. And they war aʼ astoundit, and glorifyʼt God; and war fuʼ oʼ dreid, sayin, “We hae seen unco things the day!” And eftir thir things, he gaed forth and saw a tax‐man, caʼd Levi, presidin at the tax‐liftin; and said to him, “Be followin me!” And forsakin aʼ, he raise and followʼt him. And Levi made a great feast for him in his hoose; and a great company oʼ tax‐men and ithers sat doon wiʼ him. And the Pharisees and their Writers war yammerin at his disciples, sayin, “Hoo isʼt that ye eat and drink wiʼ tax‐men and reprobates?” And Jesus answerin, says to them, “Itʼs no the hale anes wha want the leech, but the ill anes! “I hae‐na come to win richtous anes, but sinfuʼ anes to repentance.” And they say to him,  “Hoo isʼt that Johnʼs disciples fast mickle, and mak prayers; and thae oʼ the Pharisees as weel; but yere ain are eatin and drinkin?” And he said to them, “Wad ye hae the sons oʼ the bride‐chaumer fast while the bridegroom is yet wiʼ them? “But the days wull come — eʼen whan the bridegroom is taʼen frae them — than wull they fast iʼ thae days.” And he spak a parable to them: “Nae man pits a clout frae a new mantle on an auld ane; else, than baith the new piece maks a rive, and the new piece ʼgrees‐na wiʼ the auld. “And nae man pits new wine intil auld wine‐skins; else the new wine wull rive the wine‐skins, and it wull be skailʼt, and the skins destroyʼt. “But new wine maun be teemed intil new wine‐skins, and baith are preserved. “And nane, haein preed auld wine, seeks for the new; for, quoʼ he, ‘The auld is better!’ ” Noo it cam aboot that on the Sabbath‐day he was gaun throwe the corn‐fields; and his disciples puʼd the heids oʼ corn, and war eatin, rubbing them iʼ their loof. But some oʼ the Pharisees said, “Why dae ye an unlawfuʼ thing on the Sabbath‐day?” And Jesus answerin them said, “Hae ye no eʼen read this, what Dauvid did, whan he was hungerʼt, he and thae wiʼ him? “Hoo he gaed intil Godʼs hoose, and did tak and eat oʼ the Breid oʼ Presentation, and gied to thae that war wiʼ him; whilk wasna lawfuʼ for him to eat — but for the priests alane?” And he said to them, “The Son oʼ Man is Lord eʼen oʼ the Sabbath.” And it cam aboot that on anither Sabbath‐day he gaed intil a kirk, and was teachin. And a man was thar, and his richt haun was dwined awa. But the Writers and the Pharisees war lookin, gin he wad heal on the Sabbath‐day, that they micht hae an accusation again him. Noo he kent their thochts; natheless he says to the man wiʼ his haun dwined awa, “Rise ye, and staun forth iʼ the mids!” And he raise, and stude forth. And Jesus said to them, “I quaisten ye: is it lawfuʼ on the Sabbath to do gude, or to do ill? to save a life, or to destroy it?” And he lookit roond aboot on them aʼ, and said to the man, “Rax oot yere haun!” And he did sae, and his haun was restored, like as the ither. And they war fuʼ oʼ rage: and they coonsellʼt ane wiʼ anither what they wad do to Jesus? And it cam aboot iʼ thae days, that he gaed oot intil a mountain for prayer; and was aʼ the nicht in prayer to God. And whan the dawin cam, he caʼd his disciples, and waled oot frae them twalʼ, wham eke he named “Apostles”: Simon, wham eke he named “Peter,” and Andro his brither, James and John, Philip and Bartholomie, And Matthew and Tammas, James oʼ Alpheus, and Simon oʼ the Zealots, And Judas oʼ James, and Judas Iscariot, wha was the traitor. And he cam doon wiʼ them, and stude on an even bit oʼ grunʼ: and a great thrang oʼ his disciples, and an unco number oʼ folk frae aʼ Judea and Jerusalem, and the coast aboot Tyre and Sidon, wha cam to hear him, and to be healed oʼ their ills, And they that war sair fashʼd wiʼ foul spirits; and they war healed. And aʼ the thrang socht to touch him, for thar gaed forth pooer frae him, and healed aʼ. And he liftit up his een on his disciples, and quoʼ he, “Happy, ye destitute! for yours is Godʼs Kingdom. “Happy, ye wha are hungerin noo! for ye sal be fillʼd! Happy, ye wha greet noo; for ye sal smile. “Happy are ye, whan men sal hate ye, and whan they sal separate ye, and miscaʼ ye, and cast oot yere name as vileness, for the Son oʼ Manʼs sake. “Blythe be ye iʼ that day, and lowp for joy! for lo! yere meed is great Aboon: for in siclike mainner did their faithers to the prophets. “But wae for you, ye rich anes! for ye are noo haein yere consolation. “Wae for you wha hae been filled fuʼ noo! for ye sal hungʼer. Wae for you wha lauch noo! for ye sal greet. “Alack! whan aʼ folk speak weel oʼ ye! for eʼen sae did their faithers to the fause prophets. “But I say to you wha hear: loʼe  yere faes! do gude to them wha hate ye. “Be blessin them that ban ye; pray for them that ill‐use ye. “To him that clours ye on ae cheek, gie eʼen the ither; and frae him wha poinds yere coat, withhaud‐na yere cloak as weel. Bestow on ilk ane wha seeks frae ye; and frae him wha taks awa yere gudes, ask them no again. “And as ye wad that men soud do to yersels, do ye eʼen the same to them likewise. “Gin ye loe them that loʼe ye, whatna thanks are thar for ye? for eʼen the ill‐deedie loʼe thae that loʼe them. “And gin aiblins ye do gude to them that do gude to yersels, whatna thanks hae ye? for eʼen the ill‐deedie do the same. “And gin aiblins ye lend to thae frae wham ye hope to receive, whatna thanks dae ye win? for the evil lend to the evil, to receive as muckle again. “But loʼe yeʼre enemies, and do them gude, and lend, lookin for naething back; and yere meed sal be great, and ye sal be bairns oʼ the Maist Heigh; for he is kindlie to the ungratefuʼ and the reprobate. “Be ye than mercifuʼ, eʼen as yere Faither is mercifuʼ. “And judge‐na, and yeʼse be‐na judged: condemn‐na, and yeʼse be‐na condemned: release, and yeʼse be released. “Bestow, and it sal be bestown upon you: gude measur, pangʼd doon and jouslʼt thegither, and skailin ower, sal they gie intil yere lap: for wiʼ yere ain measur that ye measur sal it be gien back to ye.” And he spak a parable to them: “May the blinʼ lead the blinʼ? Wull they no baith faʼ intil a sheugh? “A disciple is no aboon his Maister; but, whan perfetit, he sal be as his Maister. “But why div ye tak tent oʼ the mote iʼ yere britherʼs ee, but consider‐na the baulk thatʼs iʼ yere ain ee? “Or hoo can ye say till yere brither, ‘Brither, lat me puʼ oot the mote that is in yere ee,’ whan ye yersel see‐na the baulk that is in yere ain ee? Dissembler! cast oot first the baulk oot oʼ yere ain ee, and than may ye see weel to puʼ oot the mote that is in yere britherʼs ee. “For a sounʼ tree brings‐na forth feckless frute, nor dis a feckless tree bring forth gude frute. “For ilka tree may be kent by its ain frute: for folk gaither‐na figs oʼ thistles, nor oʼ a bramble gaither they grapes. “The gude man, oot oʼ the gude gear oʼ his ain heart, brings oot what is gude; and the ill man, oot oʼ the ill, what is ill; for, oot oʼ the owercome oʼ his heart his mouʼ speaks. “But for why say ye to me, ‘Lord, Lord!’ and div‐na what I say? “Whasae comes to me, and hears my words, I wull schaw ye wham he is like: “He is like to a man biggin a hoose, wha howkit deep, and laid a fundation on a rock; and, a spate comin, the torrent struck sair again that hoose, and coud‐na ding it, for it was biggit on a rock. “But he wha hears and dis‐na, is like to a man that biggit a hoose on the yird, wantin a fundation; agane whilk cam doon the spate, and at ance it was dang in; and the faʼ oʼ that hoose was great!” Noo, eftir he had endit aʼ his teachin iʼ the hearinʼ oʼ the thrang, he gaed intil Capernaum. And a Centurionʼs servin‐man, wha was unco thocht oʼ by him, was ill, and ready to dee. But, hearin aboot Jesus, he sent to him Elders oʼ the Jews, wha besocht him that he wad come and save his servin‐man. And whan they cam to Jesus, they besocht him sair, sayin, “He is wordie to wham ye wad grant this: “For he loʼes oor nation, and has biggit us a kirk!” And Jesus was gaun wiʼ them. By this time he, no bein far frae the hoose, the Centurion sent freends to him, sayin “Lord, dinna fash yersel; for I am‐na wordie ye soud come under my roof. “And sae naither thocht I mysel wardie to come till ye; but speak wiʼ a word, and my servin‐lad sal be hale. “For eʼen I mysel am ane set under authoritie, and haein under me sodgers; and I say to ane, ‘Gang,’ and he gangs; and to anither, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servin‐lad, ‘Do this,’ and he dis it.” And whan Jesus heard thae words, he ferlied at him; and turnin to the thrang that followʼt him, said, “I say tʼye, I hae‐na fund sic leal faith, na, no in Israʼl!” And they that were sent, returnin to the hoose, faund the servin‐lad weel. And it cam to pass in order, that he was gaun intil a citie caʼd Nain; and mony disciples gaed wiʼ him, and a great thrang. Noo whan he cam to the yett oʼ the citie, look! thar was carryʼt oot ane deid, the ae son oʼ his mither, and she was a weedow: and a hantle oʼ folk oʼ the citie war wiʼ her. And whan the Lord saw her, he had unco pitie on her, and says to her, “Dinna greet!” And gaun forrit, he touched the bier; and the bearers stude still; and he said, “Laddie! I say to thee, Rise!” And he that was deid sat up, and begude to speak. And he gied him ower to his mither. And a gliff fell on them aʼ; and they magnifyʼt God, cryin, “A great prophet has raise up amang us!” and “God has visitit his folk!” And this word aboot him gaed oot intil the hail oʼ Judea, and aʼ throwe the pairts roond aboot. And the disciples oʼ John tellʼt him aʼ thir things. And caʼin to him twa certain anes oʼ his disciples,  John sent them to the Lord, sayin, “Are ye the Ane that soud come? or are we to look for anither ane?” And comin to him, the men said, “John Baptist has sent us to thee, sayin, ‘Are ye the Ane that soud come? or are we to look for anither ane?’ ” At that ʼoor he healed mony oʼ their ills and plagues, and foul spirits; and on mony blinʼ he bestowed sicht. And Jesus answerin, said to them, “Gang yere ways, and cairry word to John what ye saw and heard: hoo the blinʼ win their sicht, the lameters gang aboot, lepers are made clean, the deif hear, the deid are raised, and the needy hae the joyfuʼ message preached to them. “And weel may he be, wha finds nae cause oʼ stumblin in me!” And, the messengers oʼ John gaun awa, he begude to speak to aʼ the thrang anent John: “What gaed ye oot intil the waste to see? A reed, winʼ‐shaken? “But what wasʼt ye gaed oot to see? A man clad in saft attire? But look! they wha are fund in grand attire, and fend delicately, are in royal palaces. “But what gaed ye oot tae see? A prophet? Aye! say I tʼye: and muckle mair nor a prophet! “This is he oʼ wham it is putten‐doon, ‘Lo! I send oot my messenger afore yere face, wha sal mak yer fit‐road gangable afore ye!’ “For I say tʼye, Amang aʼ that are born oʼ weemen, there isna a greater prophet than John the Baptist; yet he wha is the less in Godʼs Kingdom is greater nor he!” And aʼ the folk whan they heard — and the tax‐men — laudit God, bein bapteezʼt in Johnʼs bapteezin. But the Pharisees and the Writers pat aside the coonsel oʼ God again their sels, no bein bapteezʼt oʼ him. “Unto what, than, sal I compare the men oʼ this generation? and until what are they like? “They are like bairns sittin iʼ the merkit‐place, and cryin ane to anither, and sayin, ‘We piped to ye, and ye danced‐na; we crooned a dirge to ye, and ye grat‐na.’ “For John the Baptist is come, naither eatin breid nor drinkin wine, and ye say, ‘He has a demon.’ “The Son oʼ Man is come, eatin and drinkin; and ye say, ‘See! a man oʼ gluttony, and a wine‐tippler; a freend oʼ tax‐men and the ill‐deedie!’ “And yet wisdom is justifeeʼt oʼ her bairns!” And a certain ane oʼ the Pharisees wad hae him come and eat wiʼ him: and gaun intil the hoose oʼ the Pharisee, he sat doon to meat. And see! a wumman oʼ the citie, wha was an ill‐dooer, whan she kent that he was sittin at meat iʼ the Phariseeʼs hoose, she gat her an alabaster cruse oʼ perfume, And stauninʼ ahint him, at his feet, she begude to weet his feet wiʼ her tears; and wiped the tears aff wiʼ her hair; and was kissin his feet, and crystit them wiʼ the perfume. But the Pharisee wha had bidden him, seein it, spak till his sel: “This ane, gin he war a prophet, wad hae taen tent wha and oʼ whatna sort this wumman is that touches him — that she is a bad ane.” And Jesus, answerin, says to him, “Simon, I hae a thing to say tʼye.” And he says, “Maister, say on!” “Thar was a certain creditor wha had twa debtors; the ane was awn fyve‐hunner siller‐pennies, and the tither fifty. “And whan they had nocht to pay wiʼ, he forgaʼe them baith. Whilk oʼ them, noo, wull loʼe him maist?” Answerin, quoʼ Simon, “I wad think he to wham he forgaʼe the maist.” And he says to them, “Ye hae judged richt.” And turnin him to the wumman he says to Simon, “See ye this wumman! I cam intil yere hoose: ye gied me nae watir for my feet; but she wat my feet wiʼ her tears, and wiped them aff wiʼ her hair. “Nae kiss gied‐ye‐me: but she, sinʼ I cam in, hasna left aff to kiss my feet. “Wiʼ nae ulyie did ye anoint my heid; but she, wiʼ perfume, crystit my feet. “Sae, say I tʼye, Her mony sins hae been forgiʼen; for she loʼed muckle; but to wham little is forgiʼen, he loʼes little.” And he said till her, “Yere sins are forgiʼen.” And they sittin at meat wiʼ him, begude to say to their sels, “Wha is this, that is eʼen forgiʼen sins?” But he said to the wumman, “Yere faith has saved ye! Gang in peace!” And it cam aboot that in due coorse he gaed throwe aʼ cities and villages preachin, and bringin the Gude‐tidins oʼ the Kingdom oʼ God, and the Twalʼ war wiʼ him; And certain weemen wha had been healed oʼ foul spirits, and illnesses; Mary, caʼd the Magdalene, And Joan, wife oʼ Chuza, Herodʼs steward; and Susanna; and mony mair, wha war giean oot to them oʼ their ain plenishin. And whan a great thrang cam thegither, and they oʼ the cities journeyʼd till him, he spak throwe a parable: “A sawer gaed oot to saw his seed; and as he sawed, some fell aside the fit‐road, and was trampit doon, and the burdies oʼ the air devoorʼt it. “And ither fell on the rock; and as sune as it brairdit it dwined awa; for it wanted moisture. “And ither fell amang the thorns; and, growin up wiʼt, the thorns smoorʼd it. “And ither some fell intil the gude grunʼ; and brairdin, brocht forth frute, a hunner‐fauld.” Thir things sayin, he cryʼt alood, “He wha has lugs to hear, let him hear!” But his disciples war speirin at him, “What may this parable be?” And he said, “To you it is giʼen to win the knowledge oʼ the mysteries oʼ Godʼs Kingdom: but to the lave in parables: sae seein they see‐na, and hearin they understaun‐na. “Noo the parable is this:— The Seed is the Word oʼ God. “And they by the fit‐road are they wha hear; than comes Sautan, and cleeks awa the word frae their heart, least, believin, they soud be saved. “And thir on the rock are they wha, whan they hear, wiʼ joy welcome the word; but they hae nae rute — wha believe for a wee, and in time oʼ trial faʼ away. “And thir that fell amang the thorns, are they that hear; and as they gang on their way, are smoorʼd wiʼ cark and care, and the gear and the joys oʼ this life, and bring nae frute to the ripenin. “But that iʼ the gude grun are they wha, in an honest and leal heart, hear the word and grip it fast; and, tholin aʼ, bring their frute to perfeteness. “For nane, luntin a crusie, covers it ower wiʼ a dish, or pits it aneath a couch; but sets it on a stun, that they wha come in may see the licht. “For thar is nae secret but sal be unfauldit; nor onything hidlins that sanna be kent. “Tak tent, than, hoo ye hear! for to wha has sal rowth be giʼen; and wha has‐na, frae him sal be taʼen awa eʼen what he seems to hae!” Noo thar cam seekin him his mither and his brethren; but they coudna win nar him for the thrang. And it was said to him, “Yere mither and yere brethren are staunin oot‐by, and wad see ye!” But he answerʼt, and quoʼ he to them, “My mither and my brethren are thir — wha hear the Word oʼ God, anʼ do it!” And it cam, that on ane oʼ the days, he gaed intil a boat, he and his disciples, and he said to them, “Lat us gang ower to the other side oʼ the Loch!” And they set oot. Noo, as they war sailin, he fell asleep. And thar cam doon an unco storm oʼ winʼ intil the Loch; and they were fillin, and war in danger. And they cam till him, and waukenʼd him, sayin, “Maister! Maister! we perish!” And he raise, and challenged the winʼ and the raginʼ oʼ the watir; and they war lown, and it becam a calm. And he said to them, “Whaur is yere faith?” But, struck wiʼ dreid, they ferlied, sayin ane to anither, “Whatna man is this, that he orders the winʼs and watirs, and they obey him?” And they cam till the kintra‐side oʼ the Gerasenes, whilk, indeed, is ower fornent Galilee. And whan they war come forth on the lanʼ, a certain man met him, oot oʼ the citie, wha had demons, and for lang had worn nae claes; nor wad bide in ony hoose, but iʼ the tombs: But seeinʼ Jesus, he cryʼt oot, and fell doon afore him, and wiʼ a soondin voice cryʼt, “What hae I to dae wiʼ thee, Jesus! Son oʼ God Maist Heigh! I entreat thee, torment‐me‐na!” For he commandit the foul spirit to come oot oʼ the man: for aft it had grippit him; and he was keepit in ward, and bund wiʼ fetters and chains; and, rivin his bonds sindry, he was caʼd intil the deserts by the demons. And Jesus demandit oʼ him, “What is yere name?” And he said, “Legion!” for that mony demons had enterʼt intil him. And they entreatit him that he wadna command them to gang oot intil the abyss. Noo thar was a herd oʼ mony swine feedin on the mountain; and they entreatit him that he wad gie them leave to enter intil them. And he loot them. And the demons, gaun forth frae the man, gaed intil the swine. And the hale herd rushed doon the scaur intil the Loch, and war drooned. And whan they that herdit them saw what was dune, they fled, and tellʼt it iʼ the citie, and iʼ the kintra‐side. And they cam oot to see what had come to pass, and cam to Jesus and faund the man the demons had gane oot oʼ, cleedit and in his richt senses, at the feet oʼ Jesus: and they fearʼt. And they wha beheld, tauld hoo the ane possessʼt wiʼ demons was saved. Than the hail oʼ the kintra‐side oʼ the Gerasenes entreatit him to depairt frae them; for they war hauden wiʼ a great fear. And he, gaun intil a boat, returned again. Noo the man the demons had gane oot oʼ, was entreatin him that he micht be wiʼ him; but he sent him awa, sayin, “Gang yere ways to yere hoose, and schaw what great things God has wrocht for ye!” And he gaed aff, and tellʼt throwe the hail citie hoo great things Jesus had dune for him. Noo as Jesus returned, aʼ the folk welcomed him back; for they war lookin for him. And see! thar cam ane named Jairus, and the same was a ruler iʼ the kirk. And faʼn doon at Jesusʼ feet, he entreated him to come to his hoose. For he had but ae dochter, aboot twalʼ year auld, and she lay deein. But as he gaed, the thrang delayʼt him. And a wumman haein a flowin for twal year — wha indeed had wared aʼ her gear on doctors, and wasna healed oʼ ony — Cam ahint him, and touched the fringe oʼ his mantle; and at ance her flowin oʼ blude stanchʼt. And Jesus said, “Wha isʼt that touchʼd me?” And, whan aʼ war denyin, Peter and they that war wiʼ him, replyʼt, “Maister! the multitudes hem thee in and thrang thee; and sayʼst thou, ‘Wha touched me?’ ” But Jesus said, “Some ane touched me; for I tak tent oʼ pooer gaun oot frae me!” And the wumman, seein she hadna escapit kennin, cam trimlin; and loutin doon afore him, tellʼt afore aʼ the folk for why she had touched him, and hoo she was healed at ance. And he said to her, “Dochter, yere faith has made ye hale; gang yere ways in peace!” Eʼen whiles he was speakin, cam ane frae the kirk‐rulerʼs hoose, sayin to him, “Yere dochter is deid; dinna fash the Maister ony mair!” But Jesus, hearinʼt, says, “Fear‐na! only believe, and she sal be saved.” And comin to the hoose, he sufferʼt nae man to gang in wiʼ him but Peter and John and James, and the faither oʼ the lassie, and her mither. And they war aʼ greetin and makin their maen ower her. But he said, “Wail na! for she deeʼt na, but is sleepin!” And they made derision oʼ him, kennin she was deid. But he, takin her by the haun, spak alood, “Lassie! Rise!” And her spirit returned, and she raise at ance: and he spak that she soud hae to eat. And her parents war astoundit; but he chairged them no to tell ony what had been dune. And, caʼin thegither the Twal, he gied them pooer and authoritie ower aʼ the demons, and to heal diseases. And he sent them oot to proclaim Godʼs kingdom, and to heal the sick. And quoʼ he till them, “Tak nocht for yere journey; naither staff nor wallet, nor breid nor siller; nor to hae twa coats. “And intil whatna hoose ye may enter, bide ye inʼt, and frae thar gang yere ways again. “And as mony as winna tak ye in, whan ye gang frae that citie, flaff aff the stour frae yere feet for testimonie again them.” And gaun oot, they gaed throwe aʼ the touns, proclaimin the Joyfuʼ‐message, and teachin aʼ‐gate. Noo Herod the King‐depute heard oʼ aʼ that was dune; and he switherʼt and was sair fashed: for some said John had risen again frae the deid; And some that Elijah was come; and ithers again that ane oʼ the auld prophets had come to life. But Herod said, “I beheidit John; but wha is this I hear sic things oʼ?” And he socht to see him. And the Apostles, returnin, tellʼt him aʼ things they had dune. And he took them aside, and gaed awaʼ, unkent, to a city caʼed Bethsaida. But the folk, comin to ken, followʼt him. And he took them to him, and spak to them oʼ the Kingdom oʼ God; and healed thae that stude in need oʼ healinʼ. Noo as the day begude to wear awa, the Twalʼ, comin nar, says to him, “Send ye the folk awa, that they may gang to the touns and clachans roond to lodge and fend: for we are here in a desert bit.” But he said to them, “Ye gie them to eat!” But they said, “We hae nae mair nor fyve bannocks, and twa speldrins; unless we soud gang and buy meat for aʼ thir folk!” For thar war aboot fyve thoosanʼ men. And he said to his disciples, “Gar them sit doon in  companies oʼ aboot fifty.” And they did sae, and garʼt them, ane and aʼ, sit doon. And, takin the fyve bannocks and the twa speldrins, he lookit up Aboon, and blessʼd them, and brak them, and gied to the disciples, and they to the folk. And they did aʼ eat, and war satisfyʼt; and what was left ower was taen up, twal baskets oʼ broken  meat. And it cam aboot than whan he was alane, and prayin, the disciples war wiʼ him. And he speirʼt at them, sayin, “Wham say the folk I am?” And they answerʼt him, “John the Baptist; ithers Elijah; and yet ithers, that ane oʼ the auld prophets is risen again!” And quoʼ he to them, “But wham div ye say I am?” And Peter, answerin, said, “Godʼs Christ!” And he strickly admonished them, and commandit them that they soud tell this to nane, Sayin, “The Son oʼ Man maun dree mony things, and be rejeckit oʼ the Elders, the Heid‐priests and the Writers; and be slain; and on the third day rise!” And he said to them aʼ, “Gin ony man wad follow me, lat him deny his sel, and tak up his cross ilka day, and follow me! “For whasae wad hain his life sal tine it; and whasae may tine his life for my sake, that vera man sal save it! “For what sairs it a man, gin he has gotten the hail warld, and has tint his sel, or is cuisten oot? “For, whasae has shame oʼ me and oʼ my words, the Son oʼ Man sal hae shame oʼ him, at what time he comes in his glorie, and in the glorie oʼ the Faither, and oʼ the holie Angels. “But truly say I tʼye, Thar are some here staunin, wha in naegate sal ken death, to the time they see the glorie oʼ God!” And it cam to pass, aboot an aucht‐days eftir thae sayins, that he took wiʼ him Peter and John and James, and gaed to pray, up intil a mountain. And whiles he was prayin, the look oʼ his face was changed, and his cleedin becam white and shinin. And lo! twa men spak wiʼ him; wha war Moses and Elijah. Wha schawed theirsels in glorie, and spak oʼ his depairtin, whilk he soud accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and the lave wiʼ him war unco heavy wiʼ sleep: and whan they war waukenʼd up, they saw his glorie, and the twa men staunin wiʼ him. And as they war aboot to pass awa, Peter said to Jesus, “Maister! it is graun for us to be here! And lat us mak thrie bothies, ane for thee, and ane for Moses, and ane for Elijah” — no kennin richt what he was sayin. And whiles he was yet speakin thir words, a clud cam and ower‐shadit them, and they were strucken fuʼ oʼ fear, as the men enterʼt intil the clud. And a voice cam oot oʼ the clud, “This is my Son, the Chosen Ane! Hear ye him!” And whan the voice had been heard, Jesus was thar his lane. And they keepit it to their sels; and tellʼt nae man iʼ thae days whatna things they had seen. And it cam aboot, that on the neist day, as they war come doon frae the mountain, a great thrang oʼ folk met him. And look! a man frae ʼmang the folk cryʼt oot, sayin, “Maister, I entreat ye look ye on my son; for he is my ae‐bairn! “And lo! a spirit grips him, to sudden he skreighs oot; and it rives him; and dingin him, jimply wull leave him. “And I entreatit thy disciples to cast him oot; and they coud‐na!” And answerin, Jesus said, “O fause and thrawart generation! to whatna time sal I bide wʼye? and thole ye? Bring here yere son!” And while he was a‐comin, the demon dang him doon, and manglʼd him. And Jesus challenged the foul spirit, and healed the laddie, and gied him ower to his faither. And they war aʼ strucken wiʼ amazement at the michty power oʼ God. But while they ilka ane ferlied at aʼ the things that Jesus had dune, he says to his followers, “Lat thir words sink doon intil yere lugs: for the Son oʼ Man is sune to be deliverʼt intil the hauns oʼ men!” But they kent‐na this sayin; and it was keepit frae them, that they soud‐na ken it; and they war fearʼt to speir at him anent the sayin. And thar gat up an argle‐bargle amang them, “Wha oʼ them soud be heighest?” Noo Jesus, kennin what was in their hearts, took a wee bairn, and sat him by his side, And said to them, “Whasae may mak welcome this bairn in my name, welcomes me! and whasae welcomes me, welcomes him that sent me: for he that is least amang ye, he sal be great!” And John spak up, “Maister! we saw ane by wham demons were cuisten oot iʼ thy name. And we challenged him, for he was‐na followin wiʼ us?” And Jesus said to him, “Faut‐him‐na! for wha isna contrar to ye is for ye!” And it cam aboot, that whan the days oʼ his takin‐up war come, he siccarlie set his face to gang to Jerusalem. And he sent oot rinners to gang afore him: and as they gaed, they cam intil a wee toun oʼ the Samaritans, to mak ready for his comin. And they wadna hae him come, for that his face was set to gang to Jerusalem. And whan James and John, disciples, saw that, they speirʼt, “Lord! wull ye hae us bid fire to come doon frae the lift and consume them?” But he turned aboot and rebukit them. And they gaed on till anither toun. And as they journeyʼd on, ane said to him, “Iʼse follow thee whaursaeʼer thou may gang!” And Jesus said to him, “The tods hae dens, and the burdies oʼ the lift hae nests; but the Son oʼ Man hasna whauron to lay his heid!” And he said to a different ane, “Follow ye me!” But, quoʼ he, “Lord, lat me gang first to the burial oʼ my faither!” But he said to him, “Leave ye the deid to kist their ain deid, but gang ye and spread abreid the Kingdom oʼ God!” And yet anither said to him, “Iʼse follow thee, Lord! but lat me first gang hame, and pairt wiʼ thae iʼ my ain hoose!” But Jesus said to him, “Nae man, takin haud oʼ the pleuch, and lookin back to the things ahint, is fit for the Kingdom oʼ God!” And, eftir thir things, the Lord took seeventy mair, as weel, and sent them oot, twa by twa, afore his face, intil ilka toon and place whaur he wad come his sel. And he was sayin to them, “The hairst is unco great, but the work‐folk are few: entreat ye than oʼ the Lord oʼ the hairst, that he may press work‐folk intil his hairst. “Gang ye! See, I am sendin ye oot as lambs amang the wolves. “Cairry‐na purse, nor wallet, nor shoon; and dinna be salutin ony as ye gang. “And intil whatsae hoose ye gang, say ye first, ‘Peace be to this hoose!’ “And gin the Son oʼ peace bide yonner, yere ain peace sal licht upon it; but gin it be‐na sae, yeʼse hae yere ain peace again! “And bide ye iʼ the same hoose, eatin and drinkin what they hae by them, for the laborer maun hae his fee. Flit‐na frae hoose to hoose. “And whatna toon ye enter in, and they mak ye welcome, eat what is set afore ye, “And heal the sick thar‐in, sayin till them, ‘The Kingdom oʼ God is come nar tʼye!’ “But whaureʼer ye gang intil a toon, and they winna tak ye in, gang ye oot intil the highways oʼt, sayin, “ ‘Eʼen the stour oʼ yere toon on oor shoon we dicht aff for ye! but, tak tent! Godʼs kingdom has come nar‐haund ye!’ “I say tʼye, that for them oʼ Sodom, iʼ that day, it sal be better than for yon toon! “Wae for ye, Chorazin! Wae for ye, Bethsaida! for gin Tyre and Sidon had seen the warks oʼ pooer that had been dune in you, they wad langayne repentit, sittin in tow‐claith and assis. “But it sal be better for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment nor for you! “And ye, Capernaum! Are ye heizʼt up to heaven! doon to hell sal ye be cuisten! “Wha is hearin you is hearin me; and wha is gangin you by, is gangin me by; and wha is gangin me by, is gangin‐by him that sent me oot.” And the Seeventy blythely returned,  sayin, “Lord! eʼen the demons gie in to us, iʼ thy name!” And he said to them, “I was lookin at Sautin, as like a fire‐flaucht he fell frae Heeven! “Behauld! I hae giʼen tʼye richt to tramp on serpents and scorpions, and on aʼ the pooer oʼ the enemie; and naething sal in onygate skaith ye. “Yet, be‐na blythe for this, that the demons are giean‐in to ye, but be ye blythe that yere names are putten doon Aboon!” In that vera ʼoor joyʼd he iʼ the Holie Spirit, and said, “I own to thee, Lord oʼ Heeven and Yirth, that thou did hide thir things frae the wyss and the discernin, and did mak them plain to the bairn‐like! Eʼen sae, my Faither! for sae it was weel iʼ thy sicht! “To me are deliverʼt up aʼ things oʼ my Faither; and nane comes to ken wha the Son is, only the Faither; and wha the Faither is, only the Son, and sic a ane as the Son may reveal him till.” And, turnin till his disciples, he says to them by their sels, “Happy the eʼen that see what your een see! “For, I say tʼye, Mony prophets and kings war fain to see what ye are seein, and did‐na see; and to hae heard what ye hear, and heard‐na!” And, now see! a Writer raise, tempin him, and sayin, “Maister! what maun I do that I may hae an everlastin inheritance?” And he said to him, “What has been putten‐doon iʼ the law? Hoo read ye?” And answerin, he said, “Ye sal loʼe the Lord yere God wiʼ yere hail heart, and wiʼ yere hail saul, and wiʼ yere hail pooer, and wiʼ a aefauld ettlin — and yere neebor like yersel!” And he said to him, “Truly hae ye said: do ye as weel, and yeʼse hae life!” But he, fain to mak himsel oot to be richt, speirʼt at Jesus, “Wha is my neebor?” And, takin it up, Jesus said, “Thar was a man gaun doon frae Jerusalem till Jericho, wha fell in wiʼ robbers; wha strippit him, and cloured and gashed him, and gaed their ways, leaʼin him nar deid. “And it cam aboot, that a certain priest cam doon that gate; and, lookin on him, gaed cannie by on the ither side. “And in siclike mainner a Levite as weel, comin doon till the place, and seeinʼt, slippit by on the far‐away side. “But a certain Samaria‐man, gaun on his journey, cam doon till him; and, lookin on him, was fuʼ oʼ compassion; “And comin nar, bund up his clours, teemin in ulyie and wine; and pittin him on his ain beasʼ, feshʼt him till the inn, and tentit him. “And on the morn, takin oot twa siller‐pennies, he gae them to the guidman, sayin, ‘Tak tent oʼ him weel! and whatna mair ye ware on him, whan I come back Iʼse pay ye.’ “Noo, whilk ane oot oʼ thae three, think ye, made his sel neebor till him that fell in wiʼ the robbers?” And he says, “The ane that dealt in compassion wiʼ him!” And Jesus says to him, “Gang ye, and be doin siclike!” Noo, as they gaed on, he cam intil a certain toon; and a certain wumman named Martha bade him intil her hoose. And she had a sister caʼd Mary, wha was aye sittin nar‐by the feet oʼ Jesus, hearin his words. But Martha was unco pernickity aboot mickle service, and comin doon till him, quoʼ she, “Lord, div ye no heed that my sister leaʼs me to serʼ by my lane? Bid her that she help me!” But Jesus answers and says to her, “Martha! Martha! ye are put‐tillʼt, and fashed wiʼ a hantle oʼ things. “But thar is ae thing aye needit;  and Mary waled oot the gude pairt, and it isna to be taen awa frae her!” And it cam aboot, whan he was in a particular place, prayin, as he endit ane oʼ his disciples said to him, “Lord! tell us hoo to pray; eʼen as John tellʼt his disciples!” And he said to them, “Whan ye are prayin, say, ‘Faither! hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come! “ ‘Oor needfuʼ breid gie to us day by day! “ ‘And forgie us oor sins, as we oorsels forgie ilk ane behauden to us! And bring‐us‐na intil temptation!” And he said to them, “Wha amang ye sal hae a freend, and sal gang to him at mirk midnicht, and sal say to him, ‘Freend! lat me hae three bannocks! “ ‘For a freend oʼ mine has come to me on his way, and I hae nocht to set afore him.’ “And he in‐by sal say, ‘Fash‐me‐na! the door has been steekit, and my weans are aʼ wiʼ me iʼ the bed; and I canna rise to gie ye!’ “I say to ye. Eʼen though he winna rise and gie him for that he is a freend oʼ his — for his fashousness he wull rise and gie him as mony as he needs! “And I say tʼye, Ask ye, and it sal be dune to ye: seek ye, and ye sal hae: knock ye, and it sal be unsteekit for ye! “For ilka ane that asks obteens; and he that seeks, finʼs; and to him that chaps, it sal be unsteekit. “And whatna faither is amang ye, wham his son sal ask for a bannock, that wad gie him a stane? or for a fish, wha wad gie him a viper? “Or, gin he soud ask for an egg, wha wad gie him a scorpion? “Gif, than, bein sinfu to begin wiʼ ye ken hoo to be giean gude gifts to yere bairns, hoo muckle mair wull yere Faither wha is in Heeven gie the Holie Spirit to thae that ask him?” And he was castin oot a demon; and it was a dumb ane. And it cam aboot that whan the demon was gane oot, the dumb spak; and aʼ the folk ferlied. But a wheen oʼ them said, “ ʼTis by Beelzebul, the prince oʼ the demons, casts he oot demons!” And ithers oʼ them tempit him, seekin a ferlie frae Aboon, But he, kennin their thochts, said to them, “Ilka kingdom set again itsel, is made waste; and a hoose set again a hoose, faʼs. “And gif Sautan is set up again his sel, hoo may his kingdom staun? for that ye are aʼ  sayin that I, in Beelzebul, cast oot demons. “But gif I, in Beelzebul, am castin oot the demons, in wham are yere ain sons castin them oot? Sae sal they be yere doomsters. “But gif wiʼ the finger oʼ God, I am castin oot the demons, than, incontinent, has the Kingdom oʼ God come upon ye! “Whansaeʼer a sterk ane, ready for war, has ward ower his ain dwallin, his gear is safe. “But whansaʼer a sterker ane than his sel comes on him, and ower‐comes him, he taks awa his graithin on whilk he lippened, and divides his booty. “He wha isna wiʼ me is again me; and he wha gaithers‐na wiʼ me skails a‐breid. “At whatna time the foul spirit gangs oot oʼ a man, it gangs throwe drouthie pairts, lookin for rest. But, no obteenin, it says ‘Iʼse eʼen gae back to my hoose I left!’ “And sae comin, it finʼs the hoose soopit oot and buskit braw. “Than it gangs, and taks wiʼ itsel seeven mair spirits viler nor itsel; and gangin in, taks up its abode thar: and the hinner‐end oʼ that man is waur nor the beginnin!” And it cam aboot while he was speakin thir things, a particular wumman, speakin up amang the thrang, cries to him, “Fair faʼ the womb that bure thee, and the breists that thou did draw!” But he said, “Aye, raither, ‘Weel wiʼ thae that hear Godʼs word, and nourice it!’ ” And, as the multitudes thranged thegither, he begude to say, “This race is an ill race; aye seekin a token; and nae token sal it hae, but the token oʼ Jonah. “For as Jonah becam a token to the folk oʼ aʼ Nineveh, sae sal the Son oʼ Man be to this generation! “The Queen oʼ the Sooth sal rise up iʼ the judgment wiʼ the men oʼ this generation, and sal rebuke them; for she cam frae far‐awa ends oʼ the yirth to hear Solomonʼs wisdom; and lo! mair nor Solomon is here! “The folk oʼ Nineveh wull rise up iʼ the Judgment wiʼ this generation, and wull rebuke it; for they repentit at the warnin oʼ Jonah; and lo! mair nor Jonah is here! “Nae man, lichtin a crusie, pits it aneath a cover, nor yet aneath a dish; but on the lamp‐stead, that thae comin in may see the licht. “The lamp oʼ the body is the ee; whan then yer ee is aefauld, the hail body is in the licht: but wheneʼer it is evil, yere body is become mirk. “Tak tent, thar‐for, that the licht within ye be‐na mirkness! “Gif, than, yere hail body is lichtit up, wiʼ nae pairt mirk, aʼ sal be lichtit up, as when the lamp in its glintin is giean ye licht!” Noo, whan he was dune speakin, a Pharisee gae him a bode to sit doon wiʼ him to denner. And, gangin in, he sat doon. And the Pharisee, lookin on, ferlied that he had‐na first purifyʼt his sel afore the denner. But the Lord said to him, “Noo, ye Pharisees purify the ootside oʼ the cup and the dish; but yere inner pairt is fuʼ oʼ extortion and sin. “Silly anes! didna he wha made the ooter pairt, mak the inner as weel? “Gie noo yere substance as awmous; and aʼ things are pure tʼye. “But wae for ye, Pharisees! for ye pit mint, and rue, and ilka gairden yerb under the tithe; and gang‐by true judgment and the love oʼ God. Thir things, hoobeit, it was needfuʼ to do; no to be gaun‐by thae! “Wae for ye, Pharisees! for that ye glaum at the heid‐places iʼ the kirks, and compliments iʼ the merkits. “Wae for ye! for ye are like the hidlin tombs: eʼen the men wha walk ower them are‐na ʼware oʼ them!” And ane oʼ the Writers, answerin, says to him, “Us, too, div ye lichtlie!” And he said, “It is for you, as weel, ye Writers! for ye burden men wiʼ burdens ill to cairry; and ye, yersels, eʼen wiʼ ae finger, touch‐na the burdens! “Wae for ye! for that ye bigg the monuments oʼ the prophets — and yere faithers slew them! “Sae are ye witnesses; and are ane wiʼ the deeds of yere faithers; for they slew, and  ye bigg! “Than said the wisdom oʼ God, ‘I wull send oot amang them prophets and messengers; and some amang them wull they slay, and some amang them wull they persecute;’ “And sae sal aʼ the blude oʼ the prophets, shed frae the fundation oʼ the warld, be socht oot again this generation. “Frae the blude oʼ Abel to the blude oʼ Zechariah, he wha was destroyʼt atwixt the altar and the Hoose: yea, I say tʼye! it sal be socht oot frae this generation! “Wae for ye, the Writers! for ye tak awa the key oʼ knowledge: ye gang‐na in yersels, and ye keep back thae that wad gang in!” And whan he gaed oot frae thar, the Writers and the Pharisees begude desperately to beset him, and to provoke him to speak aff?-?haun oʼ mony things: Watchin for him; seekin to kep something oot oʼ his mooth to accuse him wiʼ. And at a time whan the folk war that thick thegither that they war trampin ower ane anither, he begude to say to his disciples first — “Tak tent to yersels, and be ye ʼware oʼ the barm oʼ the Pharisees, whilk in sooth is pretence. “But naething is happit ower, that sanna be uncoverʼt — and hid awa, that sanna be brocht oot. “For sic things as ye tellʼt iʼ the mirk, sal be heard iʼ the licht; and what to the secret hearin ye spak iʼ the chaumer, sal be cryʼt on the hoose‐taps. “But I say tʼye, my freends, be na fleyʼt oʼ them wha kill the body, and eftirhaun can dae nae unco thing. “But Iʼse warn ye wham to dreid; ye soud dreid him wha can first kill, and than schute intil hell: aye, say I, him soud ye dreid! “Are‐na five sparrows sellʼt for twa bodles, in a  widdie? And no ane amang them but God keeps in mind! “But the vera hairs oʼ yere heid are aʼ coontit. Be‐na fearʼt; ye are better than a hantle oʼ sparrows! “And I say tʼye, Ilka ane that confesses me afore men, him wull the Son oʼ Man, too, own before the Angels oʼ God. “But he that denyʼt me afore men, sal be clean disowned afore the Angels oʼ God. “And ilka ane that says a word to wrang the Son oʼ Man, it sal be forgiʼen him; but to him wha speaks wickedly again the Holie Spirit, it sanna be forgiʼen! “But at sic times as they bring ye up afore the kirks, and the rulers, and the authorities, ye are‐na to be in a swither, as to what ye are to reply, nor what ye are to say. “For the Holie Spirit sal schaw ye in that vera ʼoor, what ye are to say.” And ane frae ʼmang the folk spak to him, “Maister! bid my brither divide the heritage wiʼ me!” But he said to him, “Man, wha made me a judge, or a portioner ower ye?” And he said to them aʼ, “Tak tent, and keep yersels frae being sellie; for a manʼs life disna bide in his haddin or his gear.” And he spak a parable to them, sayin, “A particular rich manʼs grunʼ bure unco weel. “And he switherʼt within his sel, sayin, ‘What maun I do? for I hae nae housin, whaur I may pit aʼ my craps.’ “And he said, “Iʼll eʼen do this: Iʼll thraw doon the biggins oʼ my grange, and bigg lairger; and gaither in yonner aʼ my wheat, and the ootcome oʼ my grunʼ, “ ‘And wull say to my saul, Saul, ye hae a hantle oʼ gude things lain by for mony years to come! Tak yere ease, eat, drink, and be joyfuʼ!’ “But God says to him, ‘Fule! on this vera nicht yere saul are they seekin frae ye! and whatna things ye hae preparʼt, whase sal they be?’ “Sae wiʼ him that is layin‐by gear for his sel, and isna rich to God.” And he says to his disciples, “Be na putten‐to anent yere life — what ye may eat? nor yet for the body, what ye may be buskit wiʼ. “For the life is mair than the meat; and the body than the cleedin. “Think oʼ the craws — that they neither saw nor shear: for whilk thar is naither girnal nor barn — and God feeds them! Are ye no a hantle better nor the fowls? “And wha amang ye, though he be eʼer sae fain, coud add to his measur ae span? “Gif, than, ye canna do eʼen a vera wee thing, why, anent the lave oʼ the things, soud ye be putten‐tillʼt? “Tent ye weel the lilies, hoo they spring: they naither toil nor spin; and yet I say tʼye, No eʼen Solomon, iʼ the height oʼ his glorie, was brawlie buskit like ane oʼ thae! “Noo, gin the foggage (whilk grows the day iʼ the park, and is cuisten intil the oven the morn), God sae brawlie busks, hoo mickle mair you, ye oʼ smaʼ faith? “And be‐na ye aye seekin eftir what ye are to eat, and what ye are to drink; naither staun in a swither. “For eftir aʼ thae things the nations oʼ the world dae seek; but yere Faither kens ye need hae thae things. “But be ye seekin his Kingdom; and thir things sal be gien ower and aboon to ye. “Be‐na fearʼt, ye wee hirsel, mickle lovʼd! for weel‐pleased was yere Faither to gift ye the Kingdom. “Sell yere plenishin, and gie awmons: mak to ye wallets that dinna wax auld; gear nevir‐failin aboon! whaur nae reiver comes nar, nor moth dis destroy! “For yer heart will be whaur yere best gear is! “Lat yere loins be girt, and yere crusies lowin. “And yersels like servants lookin for their Maister, whan he comes frae the bridal; that whan he comes and tirls, straught they may open to him. “Weel faʼ thae servants wham the Maister, whan he comes hame, sal finʼ watchin! Truly say I tʼye, he wull gird his sel, and gar them set‐to, and comin nigh, sal serʼ them. “And gif aiblins he comes iʼ the second watch, or gif he comes iʼ the third watch, and finʼ it sae, weel?-?faʼ thae servants! “But tak ye weel tent oʼ this: Did the gudeman jalouse the ʼoor the reiver wad come, he wad hae keepit watch, and no latten his hoose be howkit throwe. “And ye too, be winnin ready! for in an ʼoor yeʼre no thinkin oʼ, the Son oʼ Man comes.” And Peter spak: “Lord div ye speak this parable to us, or to aʼ the folk?” And the Lord says, “Wha than, is the true leal steward, the canny ane, wham his maister wull set ower his hame‐servants, to gie them at due times the portion oʼ their meat? “Weel faʼ that servant, wham his maister, gif he comes, sal finʼ sae doin! “Truly say I tʼye, he wull set him ower aʼ that he has. “But gin aiblins that servant soud say within his sel, ‘My lord is lang iʼ the hame‐comin!’ and soud begin to clour the lads and the lasses, and to be eatin and drinkin, and makin his sel fou; “The lord oʼ that servant wull come hame in a day he looks‐na for him, and in an ʼoor when he isna takin tent; and wull cut him sindry, and wull gie him his pairt wiʼ the fause anes! “And the servant wha cam to ken his lordʼs wull, and naither gat his sel ready, nor wrocht oot his wull, sal be sair cloured. “But he that didna come to ken, and did deeds caʼin for stripes, sal hae the smaʼ punishment. And ilka ane that gat muckle, sal hae muckle required oʼ him; and frae him wha had muckle committit to him, wull they seek the mair. “I am come to cast oot fire on the yirth; and what wull I, gin it be luntit e‐noo? But a bapteezin hae I to be bapteezʼt wiʼ; and hoo fain am I till the time it be aʼ endit! “Think ye I cam to gie agreement on the yirth? Na, I tell ye; raither division! “For, frae this oot, thar sal be fyve iʼ ae hoose, dividit; thrie again the twa, and twa again the thrie. “Faither sal be dividit again son, and son again faither; mither again dochter, and dochter again mither; gude‐mither again gude‐dochter, and gude‐dochter again gude‐mither.” And he said too, to aʼ the folk, “Whan ye see a clud come up frae the wast, straucht ye say, ‘A rain is comin!’ and sae it comes aboot. “And whan a sooth winʼ is blawin, ye are sayin, ‘A het day wull there be!’ and it is sae. “Ye fause‐anes! ye can scan the face aʼ the yirth and the scaum oʼ the sky; but hoo is it ye ken‐na to jalouse this time? “And why, eʼen frae amang yersels, judge‐ye‐na oʼ the richt? “For, as ye are gaun quately wiʼ yere adversary to the Judge, tak pains, on the road, to be deliverʼt frae him; sae that he harl‐ye‐na to the Judge, and the Judge gie ye ower tae the officer, and the officer hae ye cuisten intil the prison. “I tell ye, in naegate sal ye come oot frae yon, till the hinmaist plack ye hae paid!” And thar war some thar, at yon time, tellin him oʼ the men oʼ Galilee, whase blude Pilate had minglʼt wiʼ their sacrifeeces. And answerin, quoʼ he to them, “Think ye that these men oʼ Galilee bude be sinners  aboon the lave oʼ Galilee, for that they dreed thir things? “Na, I tell ye! but gin ye repent‐na, in siclike mainner sal ye be destroyʼt. “Or, thae auchteen, the tooer iʼ Siloam fell on, and killed them — think ye they war ill‐deedie anes aboon aʼ the men iʼ Jerusalem? “Na, I tell ye: but gin ye repent‐na, in siclike mainner sal ye be destroyʼt.” And he spak this parable: “A particular man had a fig‐tree plantit iʼ his vine‐yaird; and he cam, lookin for frute onʼt, and naething faund. “Than he said to his vine‐dresser, ‘Look! for thrie year hae I come, seekin for frute on this fig‐tree, yet find I nane: lat it be cuttit doon! Why soud it tak up the grunʼ?’ “But he answerin, says till him, ‘Maister! lat it bide this ae year mair, till whatna time I can delve aboot it, and dung it. “ ‘And gin it bear frute thar‐eftir, weel; gif it disna, ye sal hae it cuttit‐doon!’ ” And he was teachin in ane oʼ the kirks, on the Sabbath‐day, And see! a wumman, haein a spirit oʼ fecklessness, auchteen year; and she was cruppen‐thegither, and coudna in onygate lift up hersel. And seein her, Jesus spak oot, and said to her, “Wumman! ye are lowsed frae yer fecklessness!” And he laid his hauns on her; and at ance she was strauchtit; and gied praises to God. But the kirk‐ruler answerin (being angry that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath‐day), said to the thrang, “There are sax days to work in; on them, than, come for healin, but no on the Sabbath‐day!” But the Lord answerʼt him, and said, “Ye pretenders! disna ilk ane oʼ ye lowse his ox or his ass frae the tether on the Sabbath day, and lead it awa to drink? “And soudna this wumman — she a dochter oʼ Abraʼm, bund oʼ Sautan thir auchteen year — be lowsed frae this fetter on the Sabbath‐day?” And whan he was sayin thir things, aʼ wha war settin their sels again him were shamed, and aʼ the folk rejoiced ower the glorious warks dune by him. And sae he said, “Like to what is the Kingdom oʼ God? and to what may I even it? “It is like to a seed oʼ the mustard, that a man took, and cuist intil his gairden; and it grew, and cam to be a great tree, and the burdies oʼ the air beildit in its branches.” And than too, he said, “To what sal I even the Kingdom oʼ God? “It is like the risin‐dough a wumman took, and pat awa in thrie firlots oʼ meal, till what time the hail oʼt was risen.” And he was gaun on his way, throwe citie by citie, and village by village, teachin and journeyin on to Jerusalem. And ane says to him, “Lord! are thar but a wheen that wull be saved?” But he said to him, “Be ye warslin to win in at the stret yett! for mony, I say tʼye, wull fain be gaun in, and winna be able. “Frae the time the gudeman may rise and steek the door — and ye begin to staun withoot, and to chap at the door, cryin, ‘Lord! open ye to us!’ and, answerin, he sal say, ‘I ken ye na, nor whaur ye are frae!’ “Than wull ye begin to say, ‘We did eat and drink afore ye; and on oor causeys did ye teach!’ “And he wull say, ‘I tell ye, I ken‐na whaur ye are frae! depairt frae me aʼ ye doers oʼ unrighteousness!’ “Thar sal be maenin and girnin, whan ye see Abraʼm and Isaac, and Jaucob, and aʼ the prophets, iʼ the Kingdom oʼ God, and ye yersels cuisten oot! “Whan they sal hae come frae the east and frae the wast, and frae the north and the sooth; and sit doon iʼ the Kingdom oʼ God! “And tent ye! some are hinmaist that sal be foremaist; and some are foremaist that sal be hinmaist.” On that same day, Pharisees cam to him, sayin, “Gae‐waʼ, and journey on! for Herod wad fain kill ye!” And he said to them, “Gang ye and tell that tod, ‘Mark ye! I cast oot demons, and mak an end oʼ healins, the day and the morn; and the third day Iʼse be made perfete!’ “But I maun needs, the day, and the morn, and the day eftir, be gaun on; for it bude‐na be that a Prophet suffer but in Jerusalem! “O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that slays the prophets, and stanes them that are sent to thee! hoo aft hae I been fain to gaither in thy bairns, like as a hen her cleckin under her wings — and ye wadna! “Behauld: yere hoose is yet left tʼye! But I say, ye canna see me till it is come aboot that ye say, ‘Blessed is he that comes iʼ the name oʼ the Lord!’ ” And it cam aboot, whan he gaed intil the hoose oʼ ane oʼ the heid anes amang the Pharisees, on a Sabbath, to eat breid, that they war unco gleg watchin him. And look! thar was a particular man afore him, and he was dropsical. And, answerin, Jesus spak to the Writers and the Pharisees, sayin, “Is it lawfuʼ, on the Sabbath, to heal, or no?” But they spak‐na. And takin haud oʼ him, he healʼt him, and sent him awa: And said to them, “Wha amang ye, haein a son,  or eʼen a stirk, faun intil a sheugh, wadna at ance puʼ him oot on the Sabbath day?” And they warna able to answer him anent thir things. And he spak a parable to the guests, markin hoo they war walin oot the reserved seats, sayin to them, “Whansoeʼer ye may be bidden by ony ane to a bridal, tak ye no up the bonniest place, least ane better than ye hae been bidden by him, “And he that bad ye and him, soud come and say, ‘Gie place to this ane!’ and than sal ye, wiʼ shame, gang to tak up a laigher place. “But whan ye are bidden, gang farʼer on, and tak up the laigher place; that whan he that bad ye comes, he sal say to ye, ‘Freend! come ye up heigher!’ Than sal ye hae honor afore aʼ wha are sittin wʼye. “For, ilk ane that exalts his sel sal be brocht doon, and wha humbles his sel sal be exaltit.” And he said too, to him wha bad him, “Wheneʼer ye mak a denner or a supper, bid‐na yere freends, nor yere brithers, nor yere kin, nor yere rich neebors; lest they in turn bid you, and yere recompense come tʼye. “But whan ye mak an enterteenment, bring in the destitute, the silly anes, the lameters, and the blinʼ. “And happy sal be yere faʼ, that they canna recompense ye; for yeʼse hae yere recompense at the risin‐again oʼ the just!” And ane oʼ thae sittin wiʼ him, hearin thir things, said, “Weel faʼ him that eats breid iʼ the Kingdom oʼ God!” And he said to him, “A particular man was makin a great supper, and had bidden a hantle oʼ folk. “And he sent oot his gillie, at the ʼoor oʼ the supper, to say to them that had a bode, ‘Come ye noo! for aʼ things are ready!’ “And they begude, ane and anither, to mak excuses: the first ane said, ‘I hae coft a field, and need to gang oot and see it; I desire ye wad haud me  excused.’ “And anither said, ‘I hae coft fyve yoke oʼ owsen, and am juist gaun to try them; I desire ye wad haud me excused.’ “And anither said, ‘I hae mairryʼt a wife, and sae I canna come.’ “Sae, returnin, the gillie tellʼt to his lord thir things. Than, bein vexed, the gudeman said to his gillie, ‘Haste ye oot intil the throwe‐gangs and closes oʼ the citie, and bring in the gangrels, and the silly, the blinʼ and the lameters!’ “And the gillie said, ‘My lord! it has aʼ been dune as ye orderʼt; and still there is room!’ “And the lord said to the gillie, ‘Gang oot amang the roads and hedges, and gar them come, that my hoose may be fuʼ! “ ‘For I say tʼye, No ane oʼ thae men wha had a bode sal pree my supper!’ ” And thar war gaun wiʼ him an unco thrang oʼ folk; and, turnin, quoʼ he to them, “Gin ony ane is for comin to me, and hates‐na his faither and mither, and wife and weans, and brithers and sisters — aye, and his ain life as weel — he canna become my disciple! “And whasae cairries‐na his ain cross, as he comes eftir me, canna be my disciple. “For whatna man amang ye, ettlin to bigg a tooer, sits‐na doon first to reckon the cost? gin aiblins he has eneuch to finish it? “Least ance, eftir layin the fundation, and no bein able to finish it, aʼ wha seeʼt begin to jeer him, “Sayin, ‘This man begude to bigg, and wasna able to finish!’ “Or whatna king, mairchin to meet anither king in battle, disna sit doon first and seek advice, whether he be able wiʼ his ten‐thoosands to meet him wha comes again him wiʼ his twenty‐thoosands? “And gin it canna be dune, eʼen while yet far‐awa, he sends an embassy, and seeks terms oʼ peace. “In like mainner, than, ilk ane amang ye, wha isna biddin adieu to aʼ his ain gear, canna be my disciple. “Saut is gude; but gif aiblins the saut has turned waff and wersh, what sal ye saut it wiʼ? “It is naither fit for the field nor the midden; but it is cuisten oot‐by. Wha has hearin lat him hear!” And thar war comin till him aʼ the tax men and the ill‐deedie anes to hear him. And baith the Writers and the Pharisees war yammerin at him, “This ane taks in ill‐leevin folk, and eats meat wiʼ them!” And he spak till them this parable, sayin, “Whatna man amang ye, haein a hunner sheep, gin he tine ane frae amang them, disna leaʼ the ninety‐and‐nine iʼ the muirs, and gang awa eftir the forwanderʼt ane, till he lichts on it? “And, faʼin in wiʼt, he heizes it on his shouther, rejoicin; “And, comin hame, he senʼs for his freends and neebors; sayin to them, ‘Be blythe wiʼ me! for I hae fun my sheep! the ane that forwanderʼt!’ “I say tʼye, that in siclike sal thar be joy in heeven ower ae sinner repentin, mair nor ower ninety‐and‐nine gude oʼ the folk wha needit nae repentance. “Or whatna wumman, haein ten siller‐pennies, gin aiblins she tine ane oʼ them, disna licht a crusie, and soop her hoose, and seek wiʼ tentie care, till whatna time she lichts on it? “And, lichtin onʼt, she brings thegither her freends and neebors, sayin, ‘Be ye glad wiʼ me! for I fund the siller‐penny I tint!’ “Eʼen sae, I say tʼye, sal thar be joy amang the Angels oʼ God ower ae sinner repentin.” He said, forby, “A particular  man had twa sons; “And the young  son said till his faither, ‘Faither! gie me my portion that wad faʼ to me oʼ aʼ the gear!’ And he portioned oot till them his leevin. “And, a wheen days eftir, the young son gaitherʼt aʼ his gear thegither, and gaed awa frae hame till a far‐awa lanʼ; and thar sperflʼt his gear in riotousness. “But mair: whan aʼ was gane thar cam up an awesome famine oot?-?throwe yon lanʼ; and he begude to be wantin. “And he gaed awa, and was sornin on ane oʼ the men oʼ that lanʼ: and he sent him oot‐by to herd swine. “And he fain wad fillʼt his sel wiʼ the hools the swine war eatin; and nae ane gied them till him. “But, cominʼ till his richt minʼ, quoʼ he, ‘Hoo mony are the feeʼd servants oʼ my faither, wha hae rowth oʼ breid, and an over‐come; while I, here, dee oʼ hungʼer! “ ‘I will rise and gang tae my faither, and wull say till him, My faither! I hae dune wrang, again Heeven, and afore you; “ ‘Nae mair am I fit to be caʼd yere son; mak me like till ane oʼ the feeʼd servants!’ And, sae risin, he cam awa till his faither. “But, while he was yet haudin far‐awa, his faither spyʼt him, and was fuʼ oʼ compassion; and rinnin, he fell on his neck, and begude kissin him. “And the son said till him, ‘My faither! I did wrang again Heeven, and afore you: I am nae mair wordie to be caʼd yere son!’ “But the faither said to the servants, ‘Waste nae time! bring oot a robe — the first and best ane — and pit it on him; and gie a ring for his fingʼer, and shoon for his feet; “ ‘And bring oot the stallʼd cauf, and  kill it; that we may eat and be joyfuʼ! “ ‘For he my son, was deid, and cam to life again; he had been tint, and is fund again!’ And they begude to be joyfuʼ. “But his auld brither was iʼ the field: and, as he cam in, he drew nar the hoose, and heard music and dancin. “And, beckonin till him ane oʼ the feeʼd folk, he speirʼt what aiblins aʼ this micht mean? “And he said till him, ‘Yere brither has come back again; and yere faither has killʼt the stallʼd cauf, for that he gat him hame again aʼ safe and sounʼ.’ “But he was fuʼ oʼ angʼer, and wadna gang in. His faither, thoʼ, cam oot, and was entreatin him. “But he, answerin him, said till his faither, ‘See! aʼ thir years hae I serʼt ye; and never did I gang ayont yere commauns; and at nae time did ye gie me eʼen a kid, that I micht mak a feast for my freends; “ ‘But whaneʼer this yere son, wha has devoorʼt yere leevin wiʼ harlots, cam, ye killed the stallʼd cauf!’ “But he said till him, ‘Bairn! thou art aye wiʼ me! and aʼ that is mine is thine! “ ‘But it was richt we soud mak merry and rejoice; for he, thy brither, was deid, and cam back to life again; he had been tint, and was fund!’ ” And he was sayin till his ain disciples, “A rich man thar was, wha had a grieve; and he was wytit wiʼ wastin his haddin. “And haein him afore him, he said, ‘Whatna clash aboot ye is this I hear! Gie in yere reckonin as grieve; for yeʼse be grieve nae mair!’ “But the grieve said till his sel, ‘My lord taks awa my office frae me: what sal I do? I am‐na fit to delve; I wad be shamʼd to beg! “ ‘I ken what I wull do! sae that whan I am putten‐oot oʼ the grieveʼs place, they may tak me into their hooses!’ “And sae, biddin ilka ane oʼ his lordʼs debtors to come till him, he speirs at the first, ‘Hoo muckle are ye awn to my lord?’ “And he says, ‘A hunner cogs oʼ ulyie.’ He says to him, ‘Tak yere bill, and sit doon, and haste to mak it fifty!’ “And he said to the neist ane, ‘Hoo muckle are ye awn to my lord?’ And he said, ‘A hunner bows oʼ wheat.’ He says to him ‘Tak yere accounts, and write auchty!’ “And his lord commendit the  fause grieve for doin wysslie; for the bairns oʼ the warld are, in their ain generation, wysser than the bairns oʼ the licht! “And I say tʼye, Mak to yersels freends oʼ unrichtous gear; that whansaeʼer it may fail ye, they sal tak ye in till everlastin bidin‐places! “Ane faithfuʼ and leal iʼ the least, is faithfuʼ in mickle! “Gif, than, ye are‐na faithfuʼ in unrichtous gear, who wad gie intil yere keepin the true riches. “And gif ye be‐na faithfuʼ in what is anitherʼs, wha sal gie you yere ain? “Nae servant can be in service tae twa maisters; for aither the ane he hates, and the tither he loʼes; or to the ane he wull haud, and lichtlie the tither: ye canna be in service baith to God and Mammon!” Noo the Pharisees, wha war lovers oʼ gear, hearin thir things, geckʼt at him. And he said to them, “Ye are thae wha pit their sels richt afore men, but God taks tent oʼ yere hearts; for the lofty amang men is an abomination in Godʼs sicht. “The Law and the Prophets war till John cam; frae that time on the Kingdom oʼ God is made plain, and aʼ men are thrangin intilʼt. “But it sal suner be that heeven and earth sal pass awa, than for ae haet oʼ the Law to fail! “Ilka ane pittin awa his wife, and weddin anither, is committin adultery; and wha weds a wumman putten‐awa frae her husband, commits adultery. “A particular man was rich, and cleedit his sel wiʼ purple and fine linen, and enjoyʼd his sel uncolie, ilka day. “And a particular beggar‐man, caʼd Lazarus, was sutten doon by his yetts, fuʼ oʼ sairs. “And he was sair wussin he micht eat the mools that fell frae the rich manʼs buird; aye! eʼen the dowgs cam and lickit his sairs. “Noo, it cam aboot that the beggar‐man deeʼt, and was carryʼt awa by the Angels, and laid in Abraʼmʼs bosom. And forby, the rich man, too, deeʼt and was buryʼt. “And in hell he raised his een, bein noo in torments, and sees Abraʼm far awa, and Lazarus in his bosom. “And he, cryin oot, said ‘Faither Abraʼm! hae mercie on me, and send ye Lazarus, sae as he may pit the tip oʼ his fingʼer in watir, and cule my tongue; for I am in anguish in this lowe!’ “But Abraʼm said, ‘Bairn! caʼ ye to minʼ that ye gat aʼ yere gude things iʼ yere lifetime; and Lazarus the ill things: and noo he is at rest, and ye are in sair pyne. “ ‘And forby, atween us and you an unco void has been set; that thae wha wad gang ower frae here to you, canna be able; nor thae frae you to us canna come ben!’ “Than he said, ‘I entreat ye than, faither! that ye wad send him to my faitherʼs hoose; “ ‘For I hae fyve brethern; that he may bear testimonie to them, that they come‐na intil this place oʼ dool!’ “Abraʼm says till him, ‘They hae Moses and the Prophets; lat them hear them!’ “But he says, ‘Na, faither Abraʼm! but gin ane gaed to them frae the deid, they wull repent them!’ “But he said to him, ‘Gif to Moses and the Prophets they tak nae tent, naither wull they be perswadit eʼen by ane that raise frae the deid!’ ” And he said to his disciples, “It maun eʼen be that snares come; but wae for him throwe wham they come! “Weel for him raither, gin a mill‐stane war roond his neck, and he cuisten intil the sea, than that he soud ensnare ane oʼ their weans! “But tak ye tent to yersels! gin aiblins yere brither sins, rebuke him; and gin he repents, forgie him! “And gin aiblins he sins again ye seeven times in a day, and seeven times turns to ye, sayin, ‘I repent!’ ye sal forgie him!” And the Apostles said to the Lord, “Gie us mair faith!” And the Lord said, “Gin ye had faith eʼen as a grain oʼ the mustard seed, ye wad say to this sycamore, ‘Be ye liftit, and be plantit iʼ the deep!’ and it soud obey ye. “But wha oʼ ye wad hae a servant pleughin or herdin sheep, and wull say to him as he comes in frae oot‐by, ‘Come awa, and dine!’ “But wull he no raither say to him, ‘Mak ready, that I may dine; and gird yersel to wait on me till I eat and drink; and than sal ye eat and drink!’ “Dis he gie thanks to the servant, for that he did the things commandit? “Eʼen sae, ye too, whan ye hae dune aʼ the things commandit ye, say, ‘Unprofitable servants are we aʼ, we hae but dune what it becam oor duty to do.’ ” And it cam aboot, that whan he was gaun on toward Jerusalem, he passed on throwe the mids oʼ Samaria and Galilee. And as he was enterin intil a particular village, ten leprous men met him; staunin far‐awa; And they cryʼt oot, sayin, “Jesus! Maister! hae pitie on  us!” And, lookin on them, he said, to them, “Gang yere ways, and schaw yersels to the priests!” And it cam aboot, that, as they war gaun on, they war made clean. And ane oʼ them, whan he saw he was healed, cam back, wiʼ a lood voice giean glorie to God. And he cuist his sel doon at his feet, giean thanks to him; and he was a Samaria man. But Jesus answerin, said, “Warna aʼ the ten men made clean? but whaur are the nine? “Thar are na fund oʼ them returnin to gie glorie to God, save this fremʼd ane!” And he said to him, “Rise! and gang yere ways; yere faith has savʼd ye!” And, bein speirʼt at by the Pharisees as to whan Godʼs Kingdom was comin, he answerʼt them and said, “Godʼs Kingdom comes‐na wiʼ close observin; “Naither sal they say, ‘Tak tent here!’ or ‘Take tent thar!’ for see! the Kingdom oʼ God is eʼen amang ye.” But to his disciples he said, “The days wull come whan ye fain wad see ane oʼ the days oʼ the Son oʼ Man, and sanna see! “And to you they wull say, ‘Look ye thar! Look here!’ Gang ye na awa, nor pursue eftir them. “For like the fire‐flaucht, whilk shines oot oʼ the ae pairt under Heeven, to the ither pairt under Heeven, sae sal the Son oʼ Man be in his day! “But first maun he dree mony things, and be rejeckit oʼ this generation. “And eʼen as it cam aboot in Noahʼs days, sae sal it eʼen be iʼ the Son oʼ Manʼs days; “They war feastin, they war drinkin, they war marryin, they war gien in mairriage; till the day Noah gaed intil the ark, and the flude cam and destroyʼt aʼ. “And, siclike as it cam aboot in Lotʼs days; they war eatin, they war drinking, they war buyin, they war sellin; they war plantin, they war biggin; “But on the day Lot gaed oot frae Sodom, it rained fire and brunstane frae the lift, and destroyʼt aʼ. “Eʼen sae sal it be iʼ the day the Son oʼ Man is revealʼt. “Iʼ that day, he wha is on the hoose‐tap, and his plenishin iʼ the hoose — lat him no come doon to tak it awa; and he iʼ the field in siclike mainner — lat him no turn aboot to the things ahint him! “Mind ye Lotʼs wife! “Whasae is fain to save his life sal tine it; and whasae sal tine his life sal hain it! “I tell ye, on yon nicht, twa men sal be iʼ ae bed; ane sal be taen, and the tither sal be left. “Twa weemen sal be grindin thegither; ane sal be taen, and the tither left. “Twa men sal be iʼ the field; the ane sal be taen, and the tither left!” And they, answerin, say to him, “Whaur, Lord?” And he says to them, “Whaur the body is, the eagles wull gaither thegither!” And he was speakin a parable to them, as that men soud be aye prayin, and never swarf. Sayin, “A particular judge was in a citie, wha cared‐na for God, nor had respect for man. “And thar was a weedow iʼ that citie; and she was aye comin till him, cryin, ‘Do me justice wiʼ my adversary!’ “And he wadna for a time. But eftir, he said to his sel, Thoʼ I naither revere God, nor care for man, “ ‘Yet, for that this weedow fashes me, I wull do her justice; or aiblins wiʼ her aye‐comin she wull wear me oot!’ ” And the Lord says, “Hear ye what the fause judge says! “And sanna God still mair tak the pairt oʼ his ain, wha cry to him day and nicht, and thoʼ he tholes  lang wiʼ them? “I say tʼye, that he wull be gleg to do them justice! Yet, whan the Son oʼ Man comes, wull he eftir aʼ, finʼ this faith on the yirth?” And he spak — anent some that lippened to their sels that they war richtous, and lichtlied the lave — this parable: “Twa men gaed up intil the Temple for prayer: the ane a Pharisee, the tither a tax‐man. “The Pharisee, takin his staun, prayed sae by his sel — ‘Lord! I thank thee I am‐na like the lave oʼ men, extortioners, ill‐deedie anes, adulterers — or eʼen as this tax‐man! “ ‘Twice in ilka week fast I; I gie a tenth oʼ aʼ things I obteen!’ “But the tax‐man, staunin far yont, fearʼt to lift up sae mickle as his een till Heeven, but strack his breist, cryin, ‘Lord! be mercifuʼ toward me, the sinner!’ “I tell ye, this ane gaed doon till his hoose acceptit, raither than that ane: for ilk ane that heizes up his sel sal be humblʼt, but he that louts his sel sal be raised up!” And they war bringin till him eʼen the wee bairns, that he micht pit his hauns on them: but his disciples, seeinʼt, war challengin them. And Jesus caʼd them nar, and quoʼ he, “Lat the wee bairns come to me, and hinner‐them‐na, for oʼ siclike is the Kingdom oʼ God! “Truly say I tʼye, Whasae disna welcome the Kingdom oʼ God as a bairn, enters in naegate intilʼt!” And ane speirʼt at him — a ruler — sayin, “Gude Maister; by doin what, may I hae life‐eternal?” And Jesus said to him, “Hoo caʼ ye me Gude? Nane is Gude but ane — God! “The commauns ye ken, ‘Ye maunna commit adultery; ye maunna commit murder; Ye maunna reive; Ye maunna bear fause‐witness; Honor yere faither and yere mither!’ ” And he said, “Aʼ thir things hae I dune frae my bairnheid!” And, listenin to him, Jesus said, “Ae thing, yet, dae ye want! Sell ye aʼ things that ye hae, and divide wiʼ the needy, and yeʼse hae gude gear in Heeven! And come! follow ye me!” But he, hearin thir things, gaed awa dowie; for he was unco rich. And Jesus, behauldin him, that he was unco dowie, said, “Wiʼ whatna strivin sal they that hae riches, enter intil Godʼs Kingdom! “For a camel suner coud gang throwe a needleʼs ee, than a rich man enter Godʼs Kingdom!” But they that heard it said. “Wha, than, can onywise be savʼd?” And he said, “The things no possible wiʼ men are possible wiʼ God!” And Peter spak: “Lo! we left aʼ and followʼt thee!” And he said to them, “Truly say I tʼye, Nae ane has left ahint hoose, or parents, or brithers, or wife, or weans, for sake oʼ the Kingdom oʼ God, “Wha sanna win back to him mony‐fauld mair iʼ this present time; and in the Warld that is comin, life for aye!” And takin the Twalʼ aside by their sels, he said to them, “Tak tent! we are gaun up till Jerusalem; and aʼ things wull come aboot that hae been putten‐doon anent the Son oʼ Man. “For he wull be gien up to the Gentiles, and be geckʼd at, and insultit, and sputten on; “And, first scourgin, they wull tak his life; and on the third day wull he rise.” And they didna comprehend ony oʼ thir things; and it was aʼ mirk to them: and they didna get to ken the things that war said. And it cam aboot, that whan he was comin nar till Jericho, a blinʼ man was sutten‐doon beside the road, beggin. And hearin the trampin oʼ a great thrang gaun by, he speirʼt what aiblins aʼ this micht be? And they tellʼt him, “Jesus oʼ Nazareth passeth by!” And he cryʼt oot, sayin, “Jesus! Son oʼ Dauvid! Hae thou pitie on me!” And they that gaed afore flyted at him that he micht be quate; but sae muckle the mair cryʼt he oot,  “Son oʼ Dauvid! hae pitie on me!” Sae staunin still, Jesus orderʼt him to be brocht forrit till him; and whan he cam nar, he speirʼt at him, Sayin, “What wad ye hae me to do for ye?” And he said, “Lord! that I may hae my sicht!” And Jesus said to him, “Win back yere sicht! yere faith has saved ye!” And at ance he gat his sicht again; and followʼt on, giean glorie to God; and aʼ the folk, seeinʼt, praised God. And enterin, he was gaun throwe Jericho. And behauld! a man caʼd Zaccheus; and he was heid amang the tax‐men; and had muckle gear. And he was fain to see Jesus, wha he was? and he coudna for the thrang; for he was smaʼ in heicht. And he ran forrit, and speel t up intil a sycamore tree, that he micht see him; for he was comin that gate. And whan he cam to the place, Jesus lookit up, and says to him, “Zaccheus! haste ye, and come awa doon; for I maun bide at yere hoose the day!” And he hastit doon, and enterteenʼd him wiʼ unco joy. And aʼ saw it; and they war mutterin, sayin, “He has gane wiʼ a sinner to bide!” But, staunin afore him, Zaccheus said, “Lord! I gie the hauf oʼ my gear to the  puir; and gin frae ony ane I hae taen by fause dealin, I gie him back fowr‐fauld!” And Jesus says to him, “Salvation has come to this hoose the day! forasmuckle as he too is a bairn oʼ Abraʼm! “For the Son oʼ Man cam to seek oot and save the anes that war forwanderʼt.” And whilst they war listenin to thir things, he addit and spak a parable, forasmuckle as they war nar Jerusalem, and they expeckit the Kingdom oʼ God was at ance to shine oot. He said thar‐for, “A particular nobleman gaed aff till a far‐awa land, to obtain for his sel the pooer oʼ a king, and to return. “And caʼin thegither ten servants oʼ his ain, he gied till them ten punds, and said to them, ‘Cairry on business till I come back!’ “But the burgesses hatit him, and sent an embassage eftir him, sayin, ‘We winna hae this ane to reign ower us!’ “And it cam aboot, that whan he was back again, eftir receivin the kingly pooer, he commandit thae servants to be caʼd, to wham he had gien the siller, that he micht tak tent oʼ the trokin they had dune. “And the first cam sayin, ‘Lord! yere pund has gained ten punds!’ “And he said to him, ‘Weel dune, gude servant! ye hae been leal in a smaʼ maitter; hae ye rule ower ten cities!’ “And the second cam, sayin, ‘Lord! yere pund has become fyve punds!’ “And he said to him, as weel, ‘Hae ye rule ower fyve cities!’ “And the ither ane cam, and quoʼ he, ‘Lord! tak tent oʼ yere pund, what I hae keepit, lyin‐by in a naipkin. “ ‘For I was fleyʼt oʼ ye, for that ye are an exactin man; ye tak up whaur ye pat‐na‐doon; and shear whaur ye dinna saw.’ “He says to him, ‘Oot oʼ yere ain mouʼ wull I judge ye; ill servant! Ye ken I was an exactin man, takin‐up whaur I pat‐na‐doon, and shearin whaur I didna saw! — “ ‘And why gied‐ye‐na my siller to the trokers oʼ siller; that at my comin I coud hae demandit my ain, wiʼ interest?’ “Than said he to them staunin by, ‘Tak awa the pund frae him, and gie till him that has the ten punds!’ ” (And they say to him, “Lord! he has ten punds!”) “ ‘For I say tʼye, till ilka ane that has, sal be gien; but frae him wha hasna, eʼen what he has sal be taen frae him. “ ‘But they, my faes, wha wadna hae me to be made King ower them, fesh ye here, and slay them afore me!’ ” And whan he had said thir things, he gaed on afore, gaun up to Jerusalem. And it cam aboot, as he cam nar to Bethphage and Bethanie, to the mountain caʼd “The Mount oʼ Olives,” he sent oot twa oʼ his disciples, Sayin, “Gang yere ways, to the clachan fornent ye; and as ye are enterin, ye sal finʼ a cowt tied, whauron nae man eʼer sat; lowse him and bring him. “And, gin ony ane quaisten ye, ‘Why are ye lowsin?’ ye sal say to him, ‘The Lord has need oʼ him.’ ” And gaun their ways, they that war sent faund eʼen as he tellʼt them. And as they war lowsin the cowt, his maister said to them, “Why lowse ye the cowt?” And they said, “For that the Lord has need oʼ him!” And they brocht him to Jesus; and, castin their manteels on the cowt, they sat Jesus thar‐on. And as he gaed on, they spread their manteels iʼ the way. And as he was drawin nar, and was come intil the doon‐gaun oʼ the Mount oʼ Olives, the hail multitude oʼ the disciples begude joyfully to praise God wiʼ a lood voice, for aʼ the great warks they had seen: Sayin, “Blessed is the comin King, iʼ the name oʼ the Lord! In Heeven peace; and glorie iʼ the heighest height!” And a wheen Pharisees oot oʼ the multitude said to him, “Maister! rebuke thy disciples!” And answerinʼ, quoʼ he to them, “I say tʼye, that gin aiblins thir be silent, the vera stanes wad cry oot!” And whan he drew nar, he lookit at the citie, and was greetin ower it, sayin, “Had thou but taʼen tent, eʼen thou, in this thy day, oʼ the things that are for thy peace! but e’noo they are hid frae thy eʼen! “For the days wull come upon thee, that thy faes sall bigg bulwarks roond thee, and steek thee in, and rink thee roon on ilka side; “And wull ding thee doon to the grunʼ, and thy bairns within thee; for that thou wadna tak tent oʼ the time oʼ thy visitation!” And, gaun intil the Temple, he begude to cast oot thae that trokit inʼt, Sayin tae them, “It is putten‐doon, ‘My Hoose sall be a hoose oʼ prayerʼ; but ye mak it a howff oʼ reivers!” And he was teachin ilka day iʼ the Temple: but the Heid‐priests, and the Writers, and the heids oʼ the nation, socht to destroy him; And coudna mak oot what they micht do; for the thrang, ane‐and‐aʼ, war hingin on him, listenin. And it cam aboot, on ane oʼ thae days, when he was giean lear to the folk iʼ the Temple, and tellin them the Gude‐tidins, the Heid‐priests, and the Writers, wiʼ their Elders, cam on him, And quoʼ they to him, “Tell us whatna authoritie ye hae for thir things ye do; and wha is he that gied ye this authoritie?” But he answerʼt them, “I too wull speir at you anent a thing; and tell me — “The Bapteezin oʼ John,  was it frae Heeven or oʼ men?” But they coonsellʼt thegither by their sels, and said, “Gin we sal say ‘Frae Heeven,’ he wull answer, ‘Why believed‐ye‐na in him?’ “And gin aiblins we soud say, ‘Frae men,’ the folk ane‐an‐aʼ wull stane us to deid; for they are aʼ perswadit that John was a Prophet.” And they answerʼt that they coudna tell whence he was. And Jesus said to them, “Nae mair div I tell you by whatna authoritie I do thir things I am doin.” And he begude to speak to the folk this parable: “Thar was a man wha plantit a vine‐yaird, and gied some gairdeners the tack oʼt, and syne gaed his ways frae hame for a lang time. “And at the season he sent to the gairdeners a servant, that they soud gie to him of the frute oʼ the vine‐yaird. But the gairdeners sent him awa wiʼ naething. “And eftir, he sent anither servant, but him too — clourin and ill‐treatin — they sent awa wiʼ naething. “And he persistit, and sent a third; but they, clourin this ane as weel, cuist him oot. “And the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird said, ‘What sal I do? I wull send my son, my beloved ane; aiblins they wull honor him.’ “But whan they saw him, the gairdeners coonsellʼt ane wiʼ anither, sayin, ‘Here is the heir! lat us slay him, sae that the heritage may become oor ain!’ “And, castin him oot oʼ the vine‐yaird, they slew him! And what, noo, sal the laird oʼ the vine‐yaird do to them? “He wull come, and mak an end oʼ thae gairdeners; and wull gie the vine‐yaird to ithers!” But whan they heard it, they cryʼt, “Lat it no sae be!” But he, lookin hard at them, said, “What, than, may this be that is putten‐doon — ‘The stane rejeckit oʼ the builders, the same is made to be the copin oʼ the corner!’ “Ilka ane that faʼs on that stane sal be sair clourʼd; but on wham‐saeʼer it may faʼ, it will mak a clean end oʼ him!” And the Writers and Heid‐priests wad fain hae grippit him in that vera ʼoor; but they war fleyʼt oʼ the people; for they saw he had spoken this parable again them. And, watchin him uncolie, they sent oot fause men, wha soud pretend to be just, that they micht tak haud oʼ his speech, sae as to deliver him up to the pooer and authoritie oʼ the Governor. And they speirʼt at him, “Maister! we aʼ ken ye speak and teach richtly, and accept nae manʼs face, but teach the way oʼ God truly. “Isʼt richt for us to pay mail to Cesar, or no?” But, kennin their guile, he said to them, “Schaw me a siller penny! Whase heid and inscription has it?” And they answerin, said, “Cesarʼs.” And he said to them, “Weel, than! gie Cesar Cesarʼs things, and to God gie Godʼs things!” And they coudna lay haud oʼ ony sayin oʼ his to the people; sae they ferlied at his answer, and said nocht. And thar cam to him a wheen oʼ the Sadducees, wha say thar is nae Risin‐again; and they speirʼt at him, sayin, “Maister! Moses pat doon for us: Gin aiblins a manʼs brither soud dee, haein a wife, and he be bairnless, that his brither soud tak the wife, and raise up seed to his brither. “Noo, thar war seeven brithers; and the first, takin a wife, deeʼt bairnless. “And the second; and he deeʼt bairnless. “And the third had her; and, iʼ the same way the seeven — they left nae bairn, and deeʼt. “And eftir, the wumman too deeʼt. “And sae, iʼ the Risin‐again, whase wife oʼ them sal she be? For the seven had her a wife.” And Jesus said to them, “The bairns oʼ this warld mairry, and are gien in mairriage; “But they that are coontit wordie that warld to obteen, and the Risin‐again frae the deid, naither mairry nor are gien in mairriage. “Naither can they dee ony mair; for they are as the Angels; and are sons oʼ God, bein sons oʼ the Risin‐again. “But, that the deid are to be raisʼt, eʼen Moses schaws at  The Buss, whan he caʼs Jehovah, ‘The God oʼ Abraʼm, the God oʼ Isaac, and the God oʼ Jaucob.’ “Noo, he isna the God oʼ deid men, but oʼ leevin; for to him are aʼ to leeve!” And some particular anes oʼ the Writers, answerʼt, and quoʼ they, “Maister! weel hae ye spoken!” For they daur‐na speir at him ony mair quaistens. But he said to them, “Hoo say they that the Messiah is Dauvidʼs son? “For Dauvid his sel says, iʼ the Buik oʼ the Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my richt haun, “ ‘Till sic time as I mak thy faes the fit‐brod oʼ thy feet!’ “Dauvid, than, caʼs him ‘Lord’; and hoo is he than his son?” And (aʼ the folk hearin), he said to his disciples, “Haud awa frae the Writers, wha are fain to gang aboot in lang manteels, and loʼe compliments iʼ the merkits, and the boonmaist seats iʼ the kirks, and reserved places at feasts; “Wha devoor weedowsʼ hooses, and to blinʼ the een mak lang prayers: thir sal hae a greater male?-?diction!” And, raisin his een, he saw the rich men drappin their gifts intil the Treasury. And he saw a particular puir weedow, drappin in twa mites. And he spak: “Truly say I tʼye, this puir weedow has cuisten in mair nor they aʼ! “For ane‐and‐aʼ oʼ thir, oot oʼ their rowth oʼ gear drappit intil Godʼs gifts; but she oot oʼ her poortith cuist in aʼ she had!” And whan some war tellin aboot the Temple, hoo it was buskit wiʼ bonnie stanes and offerans, he said, “As to thir things ye look at, the days wull come whan no ae stane sal be left on anither, that sal‐na be dung doon.” And they speirʼt at him, “Maister; whan, than, sal thir things be? and whatna token sal be gien whan thir things are comin to pass?” And he said, “Tak tent that ye be‐na misleared! for a hantle wull come iʼ my name sayin, ‘I am he!’ and, ‘The time has come!’ — Gang‐ye‐na eftir them! “And, whan ye may hear oʼ wars and tulzies, be‐ye‐na fleyʼt; for thir things maun come aboot; but the end is no belyve.” Than said he to them, “Nation wull rise again nation, and kingdom again kingdom; “And eke great yirdins, and plagues, and famines wull thar be; unco things oʼ dreid, and great tokens iʼ the lift wull thar be. “And, afore aʼ thae things, they wull lay hauns on ye; and wull persecute — giean ye up to kirks and dungeons — leadin awa afore kings and governors for my nameʼs sake. “But it sal aʼ be for you a testimonie. “Sae, hae it siccar in yere hearts, no to be putten‐oot aforehaun aboot makin defence; “For I wull gie ye a mooth and wyssheid that no ane oʼ thae settin their sels again ye sal be fit to staun up again! “But yeʼse be gien up, eʼen by parents, and brithers, and kin, and freends: and theyʼse pit some oʼ ye to deid; “And yeʼse be hatit by aʼ men, for my nameʼs sake: “But no a hair oʼ yere heid sal perish! “But patiently thole, and mainteen yere sauls. “Hoobeit, whan yeʼse see Jerusalem rinkit roond wiʼ airmies, than tak tent that her desolation draws nar! “Than, they in Judea, lat them flee to the mountains! and they iʼ the mids oʼ her, lat them escape! and they oot‐by, lat them no come hame to her! “For thae are days oʼ vengeance, for aʼ that is putten‐doon to be fulfilled! “But wae for weeman bearin, and for them giean the breist iʼ thae days! For unco distress sal be on the land, and wrath to this folk! “And they sal faʼ aneath the sword, and wull be taen awa captives ʼmang aʼ nations; and Jerusalem sal be trampit‐doon by the nations, to the time oʼ the nations come! “And thar sal be signs iʼ the  mune and the starns; and on the yirth pangs and troubles iʼ the nations; sea and billows soondin: “Men swarfin for fear and dreid oʼ the things owertakin aʼ the yirth! for the pooers oʼ the heevens sal be cuisten doon. “And than sal they see the Son oʼ Man comin in a clud, wiʼ aʼ his pooer and glorie! “And, whan thir things begin to come on, rise ye! lift up yere heids! for yere redemption comes apace!” And he gied them a parable: “Look at the fig‐tree, and aʼ the trees! “At siccan a time as they bud, ye lookin on, oʼ yere ain sels ken that simmer is comin. “Sae eʼen ye, whan ye see thir things comin aboot, tak tent that the Kingdom oʼ God is nar‐haun! “Truly say I tʼye, In naegate sal this race fail, till aʼ thir things sal come! “The heevens and the yirth sal gang, but my words sal in naegate fail! “But tak ye tent to yere sels! that yere hearts be‐na owercome wiʼ debauch and druckenness, and fash aboot this life, and that day come on ye aʼ at ance, as a snare. “For in siclike sal it come on them wha dwall on aʼ the face oʼ the yirth. “But watch ye, at aʼ times, makin supplication that ye may hae strenth to escape aʼ thae things that are comin to pass, and to staun afore the Son oʼ Man.” And he was ilka day teachin iʼ the Temple; but at nicht he gaed oot, and bade iʼ the mount that is caʼd “The Mount oʼ Olives.” And aʼ the folk war comin at the dawin to him iʼ the Temple, to hear him. And the Feast oʼ the Sad Breid, caʼd the “Pasche,” was comin on. And the Heid‐priests and the Writers war coonsellin hoo to get him oot oʼ the way: for they were fearʼt oʼ the people. And Sautan enterʼt into Judas, the ane caʼd “Iscariot,” bein ane oʼ the Twalʼ. And, gaun his gate, he coonsellʼt wiʼ the Heid‐priests and Captains, in whatna way he micht gie him up to them? And they war blythe, and trokit wiʼ him to gie him siller. And he made a paction wiʼ them, and waitit for a gude openin to gie him up to them, whan the crood wadna be aboot. Noo the Day oʼ the Sad Breid cam, whan the Pasche wad hae to be sacrifeecʼt. And Jesus sent oot Peter and John, sayin, “Gang forrit, and mak ready the Pasche for us, that we may eat oʼt.” Than speirʼt they at him, “Whaur wad ye that we soud mak ready?” And he said to them, “See! as ye gang intil the citie, a man sal meet ye, cairryin a watir‐cog; follow him to the hoose whaur he gangs. “And ye sal say to the gudeman oʼ the hoose, ‘The Maister says, Whaur is the place whaur I may eat the Pasche wiʼ my disciples?’ “And he will schaw ye a lairge laft; mak aʼ ready; thar prepare ye.” And gaun aff, they faund as he had tellʼt them; and made ready the Pasche. And whan it cam to the time, he took his place, and the Apostles wiʼ him. And said to them, “Wiʼ great fainness hae I been fain to eat this Pasche wiʼ ye, afore my dool. “For I say tʼye, Nae mair eat I oʼt, till whatna time it is fulfilled iʼ the Kingdom oʼ God!” And, acceptin a cup, and giean thanks, he said, “Tak this, and divide it amang yersels: “For, say I tʼye, In naegate maun I drink, frae this oot, oʼ the frute oʼ the vine, till whatna time the Kingdom oʼ God may come!” And, takin a laif, and giean thanks, he brak it, and gied to them, sayin, “This is my body, that is gien for you; sae do ye, to remember me!” And iʼ the same way, the cup eftir supper, sayin, “This cup is the New Covenant, in my blude, that is to be teemed out for you. “But lo! the haun oʼ him wha is giean me up, is eʼen wiʼ me on the buird! “For the Son oʼ Man in vera deed gangs, eʼen as it has been markit‐doon for him; but wae for that man throwe wham he is deliverʼt‐up!” And they begude to speir amang their sels, “What ane it was, amang them, that wad do this thing?” And thar was a heart‐burnin amang them, as to whilk oʼ them soud be heighest? And he said to them, “The kings oʼ the nations hae rule ower their folk, and thae that hae pooer ower them are caʼd Benefactors: “But it isna sae wiʼ you; but he that is the greatest amang ye, lat him be as a younger ane; and he that rules, as gin he serʼt. “For wha is greater, he sittin at meat, or he that serʼs? Isʼt no he that sits at meat? But I am wiʼ ye as ane that serʼs. “Hoobeit, ye are thae that hae bidden wiʼ me in my temptations; “And I gie to you, eʼen as my Faither gies to me, a Kingdom. “That ye may eat and drink at my buird, in my Kingdom: and ye sal be on throns, wiʼ pooer ower the twalʼ tribes oʼ Israʼl.” And the Lord says, “Simon! Simon! lo, Sautan seeks ye, to riddle ye as wheat! “But I hae besocht for ye, that yere faith disna fail: whan ye hae turned again, lift up yere brethren!” But he said to him, “Lord! I am ready to gang wiʼ ye to dungeon and to death!” But he said, “I tell ye, Peter, the cock winna craw this day, till ye thrice deny that ye ken me!” And he said to them, “What time I sent ye oot, wantin purse, and wallet, and shoon — failed ye oʼ onything?” And they said, “Oʼ naething!” And he said, “But noo, wha has a purse, lat him tak it: and sae wiʼ a wallet. And wha hasna ane, lat him troke his mantle for a sword. “For I say tʼye, that what is putten‐doon maun eʼen be fulfilled in me: ‘And wiʼ law‐breckers was he coontit!’ for eʼen what is said oʼ me is made true.” And they said, “Lord! twa swords are here!” And he said to them, “It is eneuch!” And gaun oot, he gaed ower as he aft did, to the Mount oʼ Olives; and the disciples cam eftir him. And comin to the place, he says to them, “Be ye prayin, that ye come‐na intil temptation!” And he was pairtit frae them aboot a staneʼs cast; and he loutit doon on his knees, and prayed, And said, “Faither! gif thou be willin, pit this cup frae me! Yet, no my wull, but thine be dune!” And thar appearʼt till him an Angel frae Heeven, giean him strenth. And comin intil an agony, yet mair earnestly he prayed; and he swat as it had been mickle draps oʼ blude, faʼin doon to the grunʼ. And risin up frae prayin, and comin to the disciples, he faund them faun asleep wiʼ sorrow: And says to them, “Hoo soud ye be sleepin! Rise ye! and be in prayer, that ye enter‐na intil temptation.” And eʼen as he was speakin, see! a crood; and the ane caʼd Judas, ane oʼ the Twalʼ, comin afore them; and cam nar to Jesus to gie him a kiss. And Jesus says to him, “Judas! wiʼ a kiss wad ye deliver‐up the Son oʼ Man?” And thae aboot him, seein what was comin, said, “Lord! sal we smite wiʼ the sword?” And a particular ane amang them, strack the Heigh‐priestʼs servin‐man, and sned aff his lug. And Jesus said, “Thole ye as lang as this!” And, touchin the lug, he healed him. And, Jesus said to the Heigh‐priests and Captains oʼ the Temple, and the Elders, wha had come on him, “Cam ye oot as again a reiver, wiʼ swords and rungs? “Thoʼ I was wiʼ ye iʼ the Temple, day by day, ye raxt oot nae hauns again me. But this is yere ʼoor, and the pooer oʼ darkness.” And they grippit him, and led him awa, and feshʼt him intil the hoose oʼ the Heigh‐priest. Noo, Peter was comin eftir, far ahint. And they lichtit a fire iʼ the coort, and sat thegither; and Peter was for sittin amang them. But a particular servin‐maid, seein him sittin fornent the lowe, and glowerin on him said, “This ane too, was wiʼ him.” But he  denyʼt, saying, “Wummun, I ken‐him‐na!” And syne, anither ane lookin at him, said, “Ye as weel, are frae amang them!” But Peter said, “Man, I am no!” And aboot an ʼoorʼs time eftir, anither ane insistit and threepit, sayin, “Oʼ a sooth, this ane was wiʼ him; for he is a Galilean!” But Peter said, “Man, I ken‐na what it is ye are sayin!” And noo, while yet he was speakin, the cock crew. And turnin his sel, the Lord lookit on Peter. And Peter mindit the word oʼ the Lord, hoo he said to him, “Or the cock craw this day, ye sal thrice utterly deny me!” And gaun oot‐by, he blirtit and grat. And the men that had Jesus bund, war mockin and ill‐treatin him; And, blindin his een, they war demanding oʼ him, “Prophesy! whilk ane cloured ye?” And mony things, in blasphemous speech, war they sayin to him. And whan it cam the dawin, aʼ the Elders war gaitherʼt thegither, baith Heigh‐priests and Scribes; and they took him tae their Cooncil, sayin, “Gin ye are the Anointit, tell us!” But he said, “Gin I soud tell ye, ye wad in naegate believe; “And gin I soud speir quaistens, in naegate wad ye answer me, nor free me. “But frae this oot, sal the Son oʼ Man be sittin on the richt haun oʼ the pooer oʼ God.” And they aʼ said, “Ye, than, are the Son oʼ God?” And he said, to them, “Sae ye say; for I am!” And they said, “Whatna need hae we oʼ mair testimonie? for we oorsels heard oʼ his ain mooth!” And they, ane and aʼ, raise, and led him to Pilate. And they begude to wyte him, sayin, “This ane we faund pervertin the nation, and challengin the giean oʼ tribute to Cesar; makin his sel oot to be a king.” And Pilate speirʼt at him, “Are ye the King oʼ the Jews?” And he, answerin him, says “Ye say it.” And Pilate says to the Heid‐priests and the croods oʼ folk, “I find naething wrang iʼ this man!” But they made an unco bruilzie, sayin, “He is steerin up aʼ the folk, teachin aʼ ower Judea, eʼen frae Galilee to here!” Noo Pilate, hearin oʼ Galilee, speirʼt “Gin the man was a Galilean?” And whan he faund he was frae oot the authoritie oʼ Herod, he sent him back to Herod; he bein in Jerusalem at that time. And Herod, seein Jesus, was unco blythe; for he had aft been fain to see him, frae hearin aboot him; and he coontit that he micht see some ferlie wrocht by him. And he quaistened him in mony words; but he answerʼt nocht. And the Heid‐priests and the Scribes war staunin, and desperately wytin him. And Herod, wiʼ his men‐at‐airms, geckin at him and flytin him, cuist aboot him a braw manteel, and sent him back to Pilate. And they war made gude freends — Herod and Pilate — on that very day, wiʼ ane anither; for afore they had cuisten oot. And Pilate, caʼin thegither the Heid‐priests, and the Rulers, and aʼ the folk, Said till them, “Ye brocht this man to me as ane that sair fashed the nation; and lo! I, takin him to task, hae fund naething in him to wyte, as to the things ye wytit him wiʼ; “Na, nor yet Herod; for I sent ye to him; and lo! naething wordie oʼ death has been seen in him. “Sae, then, haein beat him, I wull let him gang!” For it behoved him to lowse ane to them at the feast. But they cryʼt oot — and the haill crood — sayin, “Awaʼ wiʼ him! and gie to us Barabbas!” Wha for treason iʼ the citie, and blood‐sheddin, had been cuisten into prison. But again Pilate,  wantin to release Jesus, spak to them. But they war demandin, sayin, “Crucify! crucify him!” But he, a third time said to them, “Why, whatna ill has he dune? I faund naething wordie oʼ death in him! Wiʼ a chastisement, thar‐for, I wull release him!” But they war yammerin wiʼ lood voices, demandin to hae him crucifyʼt. And their voices, and oʼ the Heid‐priests, owercam. And Pilate loot their demand be dune. And lat him free, wha for treason and murder had been cuisten intil prison; but Jesus he gied ower to their wull. And as they led him awa, they laid haud on a particular man, Simon, a Cyrenian, comin frae oot‐by, and laid the cross on him, to cairry it eftir Jesus. And Jesus  gaed on, wiʼ his cross ahint him. And a great crood followʼt him; and weemen, wha war makin their maen and lamentin him. But, turnin him aboot, Jesus said, “Dochters oʼ Jerusalem! greet‐ye‐na for me; but greet sair for yersels and for yere weans! “For lo! the days are comin whan they wull say, ‘Happy the barren! the wombs that bare‐na, and the breists that nouriced‐na!’ “Than wull they begin to cry to the mountains, ‘Faʼ on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Hap us up!’ “For gin sic things as thir are dune iʼ the green tree, what maun come to pass iʼ the dry?” And thar war taʼen oot twa mair, ill‐doers, wiʼ him, to be crucifyʼt. And whan they cam to the place they caʼd “The Skull,” thar they crucifyʼt him; the ill‐doers as weel; ane, indeed, on his richt haun and the ither on the left. But Jesus was sayin, “Faither forgie them; for they see‐na what they are doin!” And, pairtin his cleedin, they cuist the lot. And the folk war staunin, lookin on. And the Rulers war jeerin, sayin, “He rescued ithers; lat him rescue his selʼ! gin he be the Anointit, Godʼs chosen Ane!” And the sodgers, too, war geckin at him, comin and profferin him vinegar, And sayin, “Gin ye be King oʼ the Jews, rescue yere sel!” And forby, thar was a writin inscribit aboon his heid, “This is the King oʼ the Jews!” And ane oʼ the crucifyʼt ill‐doers was bannin him, sayin, “Are‐na ye the Anointit? Rescue yere selʼ and us!” But the ither ane rebukit him, sayin, “Hae ye nae fear oʼ God, seein ye are iʼ the like condemnation? “To us, richt eneuch; for we are eʼen winnin oor deservins; but this Ane did naething wrang!” And he said, “Lord, hae mind oʼ me whan ye come intil yere Kingdom!” And Jesus says to him, “Truly say I tʼye, this day sal ye be wiʼ me in Paradise!” And it was aboot twal oʼclock; and a mirk cam ower aʼ the lanʼ till thrie oʼclock. And the sun was hid iʼ the mirk; and the curtain oʼ the Temple was rived iʼ the mids. Anʼ cryinʼ wiʼ a lood voice, Jesus said, “Faither! intil thy hauns I commend my spirit!” And whan he had sae said, he deeʼt. And the Captain, seein aʼ that had come aboot, was giean God glorie, sayin, “In vera truth, this man was richtous!” And aʼ the folk that had gaitherʼt to that sicht, seein aʼ the things that war dune, gaed awa beatin their breists. And aʼ his acquaintance war staunin thar, far awa; and the weemen that followʼt him frae Galilee, behauldin thir things. And see! a man by name Joseph, a Coonsellor, a gude and upricht man; (The same wasna wiʼ them iʼ their ill‐deed) oʼ Arimathea, a Jewish citie, wha his sel was waitin for the Kingdom oʼ God — The same, gaun till Pilate, craved the body oʼ Jesus. And takin it doon, he rowʼt it in linen, and laid it intil a tomb that was cuttit iʼ the rock, whaurin was nae man yet laid. And it was the Preparation‐day; and the Sabbath was comin on. And the weemen wha had come frae Galilee followʼt eftir, and saw the tomb, and how the corp was laid. And, gaun back, they gat ready spices and ointment: and war quate on the Sabbath, accordin to the Commandment. Noo, on the first oʼ the week, at the dawin, they cam to the tomb, feshin the spices they had gotten ready. And they faund the stane to be rowʼt awaʼ frae the tomb. And gaun in, they found‐na the body oʼ the Lord Jesus! And it was, as they war unco putten aboot at it, lo! twa men stood nar‐by them, cleedit in glintin robes! And, as they war fleyʼt, and loutit doon their faces to the yird, they said to them, “Why sud ye seek the leevin amang the deid? “He isna here! he raise! Mind‐ye‐na hoo ho spak to ye, whan he was still in Galilea? “Sayin, ‘The Son oʼ Man bude be deliverʼt intil the hands oʼ sinfuʼ men; and be crucifyʼt, and the third day rise again!’ ” And they caʼd to mind his words. And cam back frae the tomb, and reportit aʼ thir things to the Eleeven, and till aʼ the lave. Noo, it was Mary oʼ Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary oʼ James, and the lave wiʼ them, that war tellin thir things to the Apostles. And their reports war to them like idle clashes, and they didna lippen them. But Peter raise, and ran to the tomb; and loutin doon, he saw but the linen claes; and gaed awa, debatin in himsel as to what had come to pass! And mark! twa frae ʼmang them war gaun on their journey, that vera day, till a village seeven or aucht mile frae Jerusalem, caʼd Emmaus. And they spak thegither oʼ aʼ thae things that had happened. And it cam aboot, as they war speakin and reasonin thegither, Jesus his sel cam nar, and gaed wiʼ them. But their sicht was hauden, that they soudna ken him. And he says to them, “Whatna words are thae that ye hae ane to anither, as ye gang on?” And they  stude still, wiʼ a sorrowfuʼ look. But ane, by name Cleopas, answerʼt, “Div ye bide by yere lane in Jerusalem, and hae‐na kent aʼ the things that hae cam aboot iʼ thir days?” And he said, “Whatna things?” And they said to him, “Anent Jesus oʼ Nazareth, that was a prophet, a man michty in deed and word, in Godʼs sicht, and oʼ aʼ the folk. “And in whatna way oor Heid‐priests and Rulers deliverʼt him up to deid, and hae crucifyʼt him. “But we lippened it wad hae been he that was to deliver Israʼl; and forby aʼ this, the day is the third day sinʼ thae things war dune. “Aye! and a wheen weemen oʼ oor ain garʼt us be astonishʼt — gaun earʼ to the tomb, “And no findin his corp, they cam sayin they had seen a vision oʼ angels, that said he was leevin! “And some that war oʼ us gaed to the tomb; and faund it eʼen as the weemen had said; but they saw‐na him.” And he says to them, “Oh, glaikit anes! and dour in yere hearts to lippen to the things the Prophets hae said. “Wasʼt no for the Christ to suffer thae vera things? and to enter intil his glorie?” And, beginnin frae Moses, and frae aʼ the Prophets, he made plain to them in aʼ the Scripturs the things anent himsel. And they cam nar to the village they war gaun till; and he lookit as gin he was gaun on. But they pressed him, sayin, “Bide ye wiʼ us! the day is far gane, and the nicht is comin!” And he gaed in to stop wiʼ them. And it cam aboot, whan he was sutten doon wiʼ them to meat, he took the laif, and blessʼd; and breikin it, gied till them. And their eʼen war unsteekit; and they kent him! and he disappearʼt frae them. And they said ane to the ither, “Did oor heart no lowe within us, while he was speakin to us on the way, and exponin to us the word!” And they raise up that vera oor, and gaed back till Jerusalem, and faund foregatherʼt the Eleeven, and thae wiʼ them, sayin, “The Lord did rise! and appearʼt to Simon!” And they war tellin the things by the road; and hoo he was made kent to them iʼ the breikin oʼ breid. And as they war thus tellin, he his sel stude iʼ the mids, and says, “Peace be till ye!” But they war sair putten‐aboot, and fleyʼt, thinkin they saw an apparition. And he said to them, “What for are ye putten‐aboot? and why soud doots be in yere hearts? “See ye my hauns and my feet, that it is I mysel! Touch me, and see; for a spirit hasna flesh and banes as ye see me hae!” And whan he had sae said, he airtit them till his hauns and his feet. And while they coudna yet believe for joy, and ferlied, he said to them, “Hae ye here onything to eat?” And they gied him a piece oʼ a branderʼt  speldrin, and oʼ a hinny‐kaim. And, raxin oot afore them, he did eat. And he said to them, “Thir are the words I spak tʼye, bein yet wiʼ ye; that they maun needs be fulfilled — aʼ things putten‐doon iʼ the law oʼ Moses, and the Prophets, and Psalms, anent me.” Than garʼt he their minds open, that they soud comprehend the Scripturs: And said to them, “Sae is it putten doon, and sae it behovʼd the Messiah to dee, and to rise frae the deid on the third day. “And that repentance and the pittin awa oʼ sins soud be proclaimed in his name till aʼ nations; beginnin at Jerusalem. “Ye are witnesses oʼ thir things. “And lo! I send oot the promise oʼ my Faither upon ye; but bide ye iʼ the citie, till ye be cleedit wiʼ pooer frae Aboon!” And he led them oot, the lenth oʼ Bethanie; and, haudin up his hauns, he blessʼd them. And it cam aboot, that eʼen while he was blessin them, he pairtit frae them, and was taʼen up to Heeven. And they paid worship to him; and gaed back till Jerusalem, wiʼ mickle joy; And war aye iʼ the Temple, laudin and blessin God. At the first oʼ aʼ things was The Word, and The Word was wiʼ God, and The Word was God his sel. The vera same was at the first wiʼ God. Aʼ things war oʼ his makin; and but for him was naething made that was made ava. Life was in him: and the life was manʼs licht. And the licht glintit throwe the mirk! but the mirk failed to tak haud oʼt. God sent a man oʼ the name oʼ John. He cam for a witness, to gie witness oʼ the Licht, that aʼ men by him soud believe. He wasna the Licht his sel, but it was his pairt to gie witness oʼ the Licht. Eʼen the true Licht, beamin for ilka man that comes intil the warld. And he was here in this warld, and the warld was oʼ his makin, and the warld kent‐him‐na. He cam till his ain haddin, and his ain folk war fremd to him. But as mony as took him to them, to them gied he richt to be Godʼs bairns, eʼen to them wha lippen to him. Born, no oʼ blude, nor eʼen oʼ the wull oʼ the flesh, nor oʼ man, but oʼ God his sel. And the Word becam flesh, and forgatherʼt wiʼ us, (and we eʼen saw his glorie, as oʼ the only begotten oʼ the Faither!) fuʼ oʼ tenderness and truth. John bure witness to him, and cryʼt oot, “This was He I spak oʼ, whan I tellʼt ye, ‘He that comes eftir me is afore me!’ for he was aye afore me! “And oʼ his rowth and plenty hae we aʼ gotten, and tenderness withoot end! “For Moses gied the Law; but tenderness and truth war brocht to us by Jesus Christ. “Nae manʼs sel has eʼer seen God! The only begotten Son, lyin in his Faitherʼs bosom, schaws him to us.” And this is what John spak, whan the Jews sent priests and Levites frae Jerusalem to speir at him “Wha he was?” And he owned, and denyʼt‐na, but owned he wasna the “Anointit.” And they speirʼt, “What than? Are ye Elijah?” And he said, “I am no!” “Are ye The Prophet?” And he still said, “Na.” Than they said, “Wha are ye! for we maun gie an answer to them that sent us oot. What div ye say oʼ yersel?” Quoʼ he, “I am but the sough oʼ a voice cryin iʼ the wilderness, ‘Straughten oot Godʼs road!’ just as Esaiah the Prophet said.” And the men that war sent war Pharisees. And they still speirʼtat him, and said, “Why are ye bapteezin, than, gin ye are naither the Anointit Ane, nor Elijah, nor yet The Prophet?” John tellʼt them, “I bapteeze wiʼ watir; but thar is Ane iʼ yere mids ye kenna; “It is He wha comes ahint me, but is set aboon me: the whang oʼ whaseshoon I am‐na wordie to lowse!” Thir things war dune in Bethanie ayont Jordan, whaur John bapteezʼt. On the morn, John saw Jesus comin till him, and he coudna help sayin, “See Godʼs Lamb, wha taks awa the warldʼs sin! “This is he I spak oʼ, ‘A man comes eftir me wha was afore me!’ For he was aye afore me! “And I kent him‐na; but was lookin for him to be made kent till Israʼl; sae I am here, watir‐bapteezin.” And John testifyʼt, sayin, “I hae seen the Spirit comin doon frae the lift, like as a doo, and it bade on him. “And I kent‐him‐na; but he wha sent me oot to bapteeze wiʼ watir, eʼen he tellʼt me, ‘On wham ye see the Spirit comin doon, and bidin on him, he bapteezes wiʼ the Holie Spirit.’ “And I sawʼt, and testifyʼt that this is Godʼs Son!” Again, on the neist day, John was staunin, and twa oʼ his disciples: And lookin on Jesus as he gaed by, he cryʼt oot again, “See Godʼs Lamb!” And the twa disciples heard him speak, and they  followʼt eftir Jesus. And Jesus turned him aboot, and saw them comin, and quoʼ he, “What are ye seekin?” And they said “Rabbi (meanin Maister) whaur dwall ye?” Quoʼ he, “Come ye and see!” They cam, and saw whaur he dwalt, and bade wiʼ him the lave oʼ that day; for it was nar haunʼ fowr oʼclock. Ane oʼ the twa wha heard John speak, and followʼt Jesus, was Andro, Simon Peterʼs brither. He first oʼ aʼ seeks his ain brither Simon; and quoʼ he to him, “We hae fund the Messiah!” (meanin the Anointit.) And he brocht him to Jesus. And whan Jesus saw him, he said to him, “Ye are Simon, Johnʼs son; ye sal be caʼd Cephas” (meanin “a stane”). And the day eftir, Jesus wad gang oot intil Galilee, and lichts on Philip, and says to him, “Follow ye me!” Philip was oʼ Bethsaida, the town oʼ Andro and Peter. Philip than seeks Nathaniel, and quoʼ he to him, “We hae fund him Moses wrate oʼ iʼ the Laws — as weelʼs the prophets — Jesus oʼ Nazareth, Josephʼs son!” But Nathaniel says, “Can ony gude come oot oʼ Nazareth?” Philip says to him, “Juist come and see!” Jesus lookit up at Nathaniel comin till him, and quoʼ he, “Tharʼs a leal‐heartit Israʼlite, wiʼ nae guile in him!” Nathaniel spak, “Hoo dae ye ken me?” Jesus said to him, “Afore Philip cryʼt tʼye, whan ye war aneath the fig‐tree, I saw ye!” Nathaniel cryʼt oot, “Maister, Ye are Godʼs Son! Ye are Israʼlʼs King!” Quoʼ Jesus to him, “On account oʼ my sayin, ‘I saw ye aneath the fig‐tree,’ dae ye lippen me? Ye sal see mair michty warks than thir!” And he said too, “Truly, truly, say I tʼye, Ye sal yet see Heeven unsteekit, and Godʼs Angels comin doon, and gaun up, frae the Son oʼ Man!” On the third day was a bridal at Galilee‐Cana, and Jesusʼ mither was thar; And baith Jesus and his disciples had a bode to the bridal. And whan the wine ran dune, Jesusʼ mither said to him, “The wineʼs aʼ dune!” Quoʼ Jesus, “Eh, wumman, what hae I to do wiʼ ye e’noo? My ʼoor will be here belyve!” But his mither coonsellʼt wiʼ the servants, “Whatsae he bids ye, gang and do it.” And thar war staunin sax stane jars, according as the Jews purifyʼt theirsels; and ilk wad haud twa‐thrie firkins. And Jesus had them fill the watir‐jars wiʼ watir. And they teemed them lippin‐fou. And he spak till them,  “Dip oot noo, and tak to the Maister oʼ the feast!” And they gaed wiʼt. As sune as the Maister oʼ the feast had preeʼd the watir‐wine (and kent‐na whaur it cam frae; but the servants kent), he cryʼt to the bridegroom, “Ilka man wales oot his best wine to hansel the feast; and whan folk are weel slockenʼt, than feshes the second‐wale; but ye hae hained the best wine till noo!” Sae Jesus begude to do his wunner‐works in Galilee‐Cana, and schawed forth his glorie: and the disciples lippened on him. And syne he gaed doon to Capernaum, wiʼ his mither, and his ain folk, and the disciples; and they stoppit thar a wheen days. And the Jewish Pasche was nar‐haun, and Jesus syne gaed up to Jerusalem. And thar iʼ the Temple he cam on the trokers oʼ nowte, and sheep and doos, and the nifferers oʼ siller sittin. And he made a tawse oʼ smaʼ cords, and caʼd them aʼ oot, and the sheep and the nowte beass; and teemed oot the trokersʼ siller, and coupit their tables. And tellʼt them that trokit wiʼ doos, “Tak thae things awa; yeʼse no mak my Faitherʼs Hoose a hoose oʼ traffic!” And the disciples mindit hoo it was putten doon, “Thy Hooseʼs zeal devoors me!” Than upspak the Jews to him, “What ferlies hae ye to schaw us, gin ye put oot yere haun to siclike wark?” Jesus said till them, “Mak an end oʼ this temple, and in thrie days Iʼll restore it!” Than cryʼt the Jews, “Sax and forty year gaed by afore this Temple was aʼ biggit, and are ye gaun to bigg it in thrie days?” But it was the holie temple oʼ his ain body he spak oʼ. And sae belyve, when he was risen frae the deid, the disciples caʼd to mind that he had said this to them; and they lippened the word, and aʼ that Jesus said. And whan he was at the Pasche in Jerusalem, as the Feast gaed on, mony begude to believe on his name, whan they saw the ferlies dune aneath his haun. But Jesus didna lippen and gie his sel ower to them, for he kent men, And needit‐na that ony soud tell him aboot a man, for he kent aʼ that was in man. Thar was ane oʼ the Pharisees, by name Nicodemus; and in authoritie amang the Jews. And he cam iʼ the mirk oʼ the nicht to Jesus, and quoʼ he, “Maister! we aʼ ken ye are a Teacher frae God; for nane could do sic wunner‐works as ye do, gin God warna wiʼ him!” Jesus said to him, “Truly say I tʼye, gin a man be‐na born again, his eʼen sal never see Godʼs Kingdom!” Quoʼ Nicodemus, “But hooʼs a man to be born in eild? Maun he return till his mitherʼs womb, and be born ower again?” But Jesus spak: “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Gin a man be‐na watir‐born and Spirit‐born, heʼse no come intil Godʼs Kingdom! “And aye that whilk is born oʼ the flesh is itsel flesh, and that whilk is born oʼ the Spirit is spirit. “Mak nae ferlie oʼ my words, ‘Ye maun be born again!’ “The wind blaws whaur it wull, and ye hear the sough oʼt, but canna ken whaur it comes frae, nor whaur it gangs tae: sae is it wiʼ ane born oʼ the Spirit.” Nicodemus says to him, “Hoo can siccan a thing be?” Quoʼ Jesus to him, “Can ye be a Maister oʼ Israʼl, and ken‐na thir things? “Truly, truly say I tʼye,  we speak what we ken, and bear witness oʼ oor ain een; and ye winna hear us. “Gin I hae tauld ye things oʼ the yirth, and ye winna hae them, wull ye lippen my word anent things oʼ Heeven? “And nae man has eʼer gane up Aboon, but he that cam doon frae Aboon — the Son oʼ Man, wha bides Aboon. “And like as Moses iʼ the wilderness heized up the serpent, sae maun the Son oʼ Man be liftit heigh; “That aʼ wha lippen till him soudna dee, but hae Life for aye! “For God sae loved the warld as to gie his Son, the Only‐Begotten Ane, that ilka ane wha lippens till him sudna dee, but hae Life for aye. “For God sent‐na his Son intil the warld to bring condemnation onʼt, but that raither the warld micht be saved by him. “And ane that lippens him isna hauden guilty; but ane wha winna lippen him is judged guilty eʼen no; for he hasna lippened to the Son oʼ God, the only‐begotten Ane. “And here is the sentence he drees: that licht beams on the warld, and men loʼe the mirk and no the licht; for that their deeds are wrang. “For ilka ane that follows ill hates the licht, and comes na tillʼt; jalousin that his ill deeds wull be seen. “But the man wha has the truth seeks the licht, that aʼ his deeds may be plainly seen, that they are dune iʼ the pooer oʼ God.” Eftir thae things, Jesus and the disciples cam intil Judea; and he bade wiʼ them, bapteezin. And John his sel was in Enon, nar‐by Salim, bapteezin; for thar was rowth oʼ watir thar‐aboot; and the folk cam to be bapteezʼt. For John wasna yet cuisten intil prison. And noo thar cam a quaisten atween Johnʼs disciples and a Jew anent purification. And till John they cam, sayin, “Maister! the Ane that was ayont Jordan wiʼ ye, the Ane ye bure witness till — dʼye ken heʼs bapteezin, and aʼ the folk come till HIM?” John says to them, “Ane can hae naething gien him, gin it be na frae Heeven. “Ye mind yersels that I said, ‘I am no the Messiah, but ane sent afore him!’ “The ane that has the bride, he is the bridegroom; but the bridegroomʼs gude freend staunin by, and hearin his word, joys iʼ the voice oʼ the bridegroom. This is my joy fulfilled! “He maun wax, but I maun wane. “He that comes frae Aboon, is aboon aʼ folk; he wha is oʼ the yirth is yirth‐like, and speaks oʼ the yirth; but he wha is frae Aboon is aboon aʼ. “And he speaks oʼ the sicht oʼ his ain eʼen; and thar isna a man to tak him at his word! “But ony ane that taks his word, he has set his seal to the truth oʼ God, and made it his ain. “For the Ane sent frae God speaks Godʼs word; for he has sent the Spirit ayont aʼ measure. “The Faither loʼes his Son; and gies aʼ things intil his hauns. “The man wha lippens on the Son has Life for Aye, and he wha winna believe the Son sal see Life nevir; but the ban oʼ God on him sal bide!” Noo, whan the Lord kent the Pharisees had word that he gaitherʼt in and bapteezʼt mair folk than John did — (But it was the disciples, and no Jesusʼ sel wha bapteezʼt) — He quat the Jewsʼ kintra‐side, and gaed awa again intil Galilee: And he behoved to gang athort Samaria. And he lichtit on a Samaria citie caʼd Sychar; nar‐haun the bit grunʼ Jaucob giʼed to Joseph. And Jaucobʼs waal  was thar‐at. And Jesus, forfouchten wiʼ the way, cuist his sel doon on the waal: and it was aboot the denner‐time. Than thar cam a Samaria‐wumman forrit, to draw watir. Quoʼ Jesus, “Lat me have a sowp oʼ watir!” (His disciples had aʼ gane to the citie for meat.) Quoʼ the Samaria‐wumman, “Hoo isʼt that ye, bein a Jew, are seekin drink frae me, a Samaria‐wumman?” (For the Jews hae nae trokin nor neeborliness wiʼ the Samaria‐folk.) Quoʼ Jesus, “Gin ye kent Godʼs Gift, and wha it soud be that said ‘Gie me a sowp oʼ watir,’ ye wad hae socht frae him the Leevinʼ Watir — and gottenʼt too!” Said the wumman to him, “Sir, ye hae naething to lat doon the waal, and the waalʼs unco deep; whaur finʼ ye the Leevin Watir? “Ye canna be greater nor oor forebear Jaucob, wha gied us the waal, and slockened his ain drouth wiʼt, and the drouth oʼ his bairns — and his beasts?” Jesus said to her, “Wha may drink this watir wull be drouthie syne; “But wha drinks oʼ the watir I gie him, sal be drouthie nevirmair; for the watir I gie him sal be in him an unseen waal, springin up intil Life Eternal!” The wumman cryʼt oot, “Sir, lat me hae this watir! no to be drouthie, and neʼer to fash to come to the waal again!” Quoʼ Jesus, “Gang awa, and caʼ yere gudeman, and come again belyve!” But the wumman said to him, “I haena a gudeman!” Quoʼ Jesus, “Ye hae dune richt to say ye haena a gudeman; “For ye hae had fyve; and the ane ye hae e‐noo is no yere ain gudeman; ye spak truth thar.” Quoʼ the wumman, “Sir, I jalouse ye maun be a Prophet! “Oor forebears worshipped iʼ this vera mountain; but yere folk say Jerusalemʼs the place whaur folk soud worship —” Jesus pat in, “Wumman, lippen to me! the ʼoorʼs at haun, whan naither  here , nor yet  thar , sal they worship the Faither! “Ye ken‐na what ye serʼ; but we ken what we worship; and salvation comes frae amang the Jews. “But the ʼoor is at haun, and eʼen noo it comes, whan Godʼs ain worshippers sal worship the Faither in the truth and wiʼ the Spirit — for the Faither wad hae siclike to seek him. “God is a spirit; and wha worship him maun eʼen do sae iʼ the spirit and wiʼ the truth.” The wumman says, “I ken Messiahʼs comin, that folk caʼ ‘The Christ’; whan he comes, heʼll tell us aʼ.” Jesus spak — “I thatʼs noo speakin tʼye am  ‘The Christ!’ ” On the back oʼ this cam the disciples, and ferlied that he soud be speakin wiʼ the wumman; but nane oʼ them speirʼt, “What are ye seekin?” nor, “Hoo isʼt that ye talk wiʼ the wumman?” Than the wumman, leavin her watir‐stoup, gaed awa to the citie, and cryʼt oot to the men, “Coʼ way! and see a man that tellʼt me aʼ that evir I did! Is he no the Messiah?” Then they gaed oot oʼ the citie to come till him. But atween times his disciples war ask‐askin him, “Maister! wull ye no eat?” But quoʼ he to them, “I hae meat that ye ken‐na!” And sae they speirʼt ane oʼ anither, “Think ye ony ane brocht him ocht to eat?” Quoʼ Jesus, “Itʼs meat to me to do his wull that sent me, and finish his wark! “Div ye no say, ‘Fowr months, and than the hairst’? But unsteek yere een and see the fields — theyʼre whitenin till the hairst eʼen noo! “And the shearer wins his fee, and gaithers till him an eternal hairst; and the sawer and shearer are baith blythe thegither! “And the auld proverb comes true ower again, ‘Ane saws, and syne anither shears!’ “I bade ye to a hairst whauron ye hadna toiled: ither men toiled, and ye are entered on their reward.” And mony oʼ the Samaria‐folk lippened on him for the wummanʼs sake, wha aye threepit, “He tellʼt me aʼ that evir I did!” Sae whan they cam till him they besocht him to bide wiʼ them; and he stoppit twa‐thrie days thar. And a hantle mair believed whan they heard his ain word; And quoʼ they to the wumman, “Noo we believe — no for yere report — for oor ain lugs hae heard him; and noo we ken that he is the Anointit Ane, the warldʼs Saviour!” And twa days eftir he gaed forth again intil some oʼ the pairts oʼ Galilee. For Jesus his sel testifyʼt that “a Prophet had nae repute in his ain kintra‐side.” Syne he cam intil the pairts oʼ Galilee, and the folk thar acceptit him, for they had seen aʼ that he did at the Feast in Jerusalem; (for they as weel gaed up till the Feast). And ance mair he cam up till Galilee‐Cana, whaur he made the watir wine. And there was a certain hie officer, whase son was ill at Capernaum. As sune as he got a sough oʼ Jesus comin oot oʼ Judea intil Galilee, he gaed till him, and besocht him to come doon and heal his son; for he was in extremitie. Jesus answerʼt him, “Gin ye see‐na signs and ferlies, yeʼre set again believin.” The great man says to him, “Sir, come awa doon, ʼor my bairn dee!” Quoʼ Jesus to him, “Gang yere gate; yere son leeves!” The man lippened the word oʼ Jesus to him, and took the gate. And as he was eʼen noo gangin doon, his servants met him wiʼ, “Yere sonʼs leevin!” Syne he speirʼt at them the ʼoor the illness took a turn? and quoʼ they, “Yestreen, at ane oʼclock oʼ the day, the fivver gaed awa.” Sae the faither kent it was at that ʼoor Jesus said to him, “Yere son leeves!” and he his sel believed and his hail hoose. This is the second wuner‐wark Jesus did, bein come oot oʼ Judea intil Galilee. Eftir thir things thar cam a Feast oʼ the Jews; and Jesus gaed up till Jerusalem. Noo, in Jerusalem, by the sheep‐port is a pool caʼd (iʼ the Hebrew) Bethesda, and beside it fyve porticoes. In thae lay a hantle oʼ folk; sick, blinʼ, lameters, and dwined‐awa anes, waitin for the steerin oʼ the watir. For an angel (quoʼ they) gaed doon whiles intil the pool, and set the watir asteer; than whaever first stappit in was made hale oʼ his compleent. And a particular man thar had been helpless for aucht‐and‐thretty year. And Jesus seein him lyin, and kennin he had lang been sae, says to him, “Wad ye be made hale?” The feckless ane answert, “Sir, I hae nae ane to pit me in; but whan Iʼm ettlin to hirple doon, some ither ane staps in fore me!” Quoʼ Jesus to him, “Up ! tak up yere couch, and gang!” And at ance the man was made hale, and took up his couch, and walkit; and that vera day was the Sabbath‐day. Sae said the Jews to him wha was made hale, “This is the Sabbath‐day! itʼs no allooed for ye to be carryin yere couch!” He answerʼt them, “The ane that made me hale, he orderʼt me, ‘Tak up yere couch, and gang!’ ” Than speirʼt they at him, “Wha wasʼt that said tʼye, ‘Tak up yere couch and gang?’ ” And he wha was made hale kent‐na wha it was; for Jesus had withdrawn his sel, a great thrang bein aboot. Syne Jesus, lichtin on him iʼ the Temple, says to him, “See, ye are made hale; sin nae mair, that something waur come‐na tʼye!” The man gaed awa, and tellʼt the Jews it was Jesus wha made him hale. Sae the Jews persecutit Jesus, and wad fain hae killʼt him, for doin thir things on the Sabbath‐day. But Jesus answerʼt them, “My Faither works eʼen till noo, and I too work.” Sae the Jews ettlʼt mair and mair to kill him: for he hadna only broken the Sabbath (quoʼ they) but mair — had said that God was his Faither, makin his sel Godʼs marrow. Than said Jesus to them, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, The Son dis naething oʼ his sel allenarlie, but sic as he sees the Faither do: for siclike things the Faither dis, thae also dis the Son as weel. “For the Faither loʼes the Son, and schaws till him aʼ things he dis his sel: and greater warks than thir wull he schaw him, that ye may ferlie. “For eʼen as the Faither feshes up the deid, and gies life to them, sae sal the Son gie life to wham he wull. “For the Faither judges nae man, but has gien ower aʼ Judgment to the Son; “Sae that aʼ men soud gie honor to the Son, eʼen as they gie honor to the Faither. “Truly, truly say I tʼye, The man wha hears my word, and lippens on him wha sent me, has Life for Aye, and comes‐na intil condemnation; but he is come oot oʼ death intil Life. “Truly, truly say I tʼye, The ʼoor is comin, and eʼen noo is, whan the deid sal hear the voice oʼ the Son oʼ God, and they wha hear sal leeve! “For eʼen as the Faither has life within his sel, sae has he giftit to the Son to hae life within HIS SEL! “And has gien to him pooer to gie judgment as weel, for that he is the Son oʼ Man. “Mak nae ferlie oʼ this; for the ʼoor is comin whan aʼ in their graves sal hear his voice, “And sal come forrit; thae wha hae weel dune, to the up‐risin oʼ Life: and they wha hae ill dune, to the up‐risin oʼ condemnation. “I can oʼ my ain sel, allenarlie, do naething; like as I hear, sae I judge; and my judgment is richtous; seein I seek‐na my ain wull, but the Faitherʼs wull wha sent me. “Gin I gie witness oʼ mysel, my witness needna be taʼen. “Thar is anither wha witnesses oʼ me; and I ken the witness he bears oʼ me is true. “Ye sent till John, and he bure witness to the Truth. “But I hae need oʼ manʼs testimonie; but thir things I say, that ye micht be saved. “He was a licht that lowed and glintit; and ye war fain for a wee to glorie in his licht. “But I hae greater witness than the like oʼ John; for the warks the Faither has gien me to do — the vera warks I do — bear me witness that the Faither has sent me. “And the Faither his sel wha sent me, has gien witness oʼ me. Ye nevir heard his voice, nor saw his form! “Naither hae ye his word abidin ye; for the Ane he has sent, him ye lippen‐na. “Ye seek in the Scripturs; for in them ye think ye hae Life for Aye: and it is eʼen thae that testify oʼ me. “And ye winna come to me that ye micht hae Life. “I receive‐na glorie frae men. “But I ken ye weel, that the love oʼ God is wantin in ye. “Here am I, come in my Faitherʼs name, and ye winna receive me: gin some ither soud come in his ain name, yeʼll receive him. “Hoo can ye believe, receivin glorie ane frae anither? and the glorie that comes frae the only God ye seek‐na! “Think‐na Iʼll wyte ye afore the Faither: tharʼs ane accusin ye, eʼen Moses, on wham ye lippen yersels. “For gin he had lippened Mosesʼ word, ye wad hae lippened me; for he wrate oʼ me. “But gin ye lippen‐na his words penned, hoo sal ye lippen my words spoken?” Syne aʼ thae things war by, Jesus gaed ower till the ither side oʼ the Loch oʼ Galilee, caʼd the Loch oʼ Tiberias. And great thrangs cam eftir him, for that they saw the ferlies he wrocht on sick folk. And Jesus gaed up intil a mountain, and sat doon thar amang his disciples. And the Pasche was nar‐haun, a Feast oʼ the Jews. When Jesus had liftit up his een, and had seen sic a great company come till him, he says to Philip, “Hoo sal we buy breid, that aʼ thae may eat?” And this he said to try him: for he kent his sel what he wad do. Quoʼ Philip, “Twa hunder siller pennies in breid wadna be eneuch for them aʼ, that ilka ane soud hae a wee.” And ane oʼ the disciples, Andro, Simon Peterʼs brither, says to him, “Tharʼs a callant here, wha has fyve barley‐bannocks, and twa wee speldrins; but what wad thae be amang sae mony?” Quoʼ Jesus, “Mak the men sit doon!” Noo thar was a rowth oʼ geras iʼ the place. Sae the men sat aʼ doon, aboot fyve thoosand oʼ them. And Jesus took the bannocks, and whan he had gien thanks, he gied to the disciples, and the disciples to them that war sutten doon; and eke oʼ the speldrins, as mickle as they wad. Whan they war aʼ satisfyʼt, quoʼ he to his disciples, “Gaither up the mools and bits that are ower, sae that thar be naething wastit.” Sae they gatherʼt them up, and filled twa creels wiʼ the broken bits oʼ the fyve barley‐bannocks, remainin ower to them wha had eaten. Than thae men, whan they had seen the ferlie wrocht by Jesus, cryʼt aʼ, “This is, oʼ a certaintie, yon Prophet that was to come intil the warld!” Whan Jesus kent that they wad come, and tak him wiʼ the strang haun to mak him a King, he withdrew again intil a mountain, by his sel alane. And whan the gloamin was come, his disciples gaed doon till the loch, And enterʼt intil a smack, and gaed ower the loch, airtin for Capernaum. And it was noo mirk, and Jesus wasna come to them. And the sea raise wiʼ a great wunʼ blawin. And whan they had rowʼt thrie or fowr mile, they see Jesus walkin on the loch, and comin nar‐haun till the smack; and they war frichtenʼt. And he spak up to them, “It is I! be‐na frichtenʼt!” Than they war fain to receive him intil the boat; and belyve the boat was to land, whaur they had airtit. The day eftir, when the folk staunin on the ither shore saw thar was nae boat thar‐aboot but the ane the disciples gaed intil, and that Jesus gaed‐na wiʼ them intil the smack, but that the disciples had gane awa by their sels:— (Hoosever thar cam ither boats frae Tiberias, nar‐haun the bit whaur they had breid, eftir that the Lord had gied thanks:) The folk tharfor, seein that naither Jesus nor his disciples war thar‐aboots, took boat, and cam till Capernaum seekin for Jesus. And whan they had fund him on the ither side oʼ the sea, quoʼ they to him, “Rabbi, whan cam ye here?” Jesus answerʼt them, and quoʼ he, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, ye seek me, no sae muckle that ye saw wunner‐warks, but that ye did eat oʼ the bannocks, and filled yersels. “Seek‐na for perishin meat, but for that meat that bides until Eternal Life, whilk the Son oʼ Man sal gie ye: for him has the Faither, eʼen God, sealed.” Quoʼ they to him, “And what maun we do, to work the warks oʼ God?” Jesus answerʼt them and said, “This is Godʼs wark, that ye lippen on him God has sent.” Syne they said to him, “What ferlie div ye schaw, that we could see and lippen? What div ye? “Oor forbears did eat manna iʼ the waste; as it is putten doon, ‘He gied them breid oot oʼ Heeven to eat.’ ” Than said Jesus to them, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, It wasna Moses gied ye the breid oot oʼ Heeven; but my Faither he gies ye the raal Breid frae Heeven! “For Godʼs Breid is he wha comes doon oot oʼ Heeven, and gies Life to the warld.” Than said they to him, “Lord! aye gie us sic breid!” Quoʼ Jesus to them, “I am the Breid oʼ Life! wha come to me sal hungʼer nae mair: and wha lippens on me sal be drouthie nevir! “But say I tʼye, ye hae seen me, and yet ye believe‐na. “They aʼ come to me that the Faither gies me; and wha comes to me, nevir in onygate wull I caʼ him awaʼ! “For I hae come doon frae Heeven, no to do the wull oʼ my ain, but the wull oʼ him that sent me. “And here is the Faitherʼs wull wha sent me:— That oot oʼ aʼ he has gien me I soud tine nane, but soud raise aʼ up again at the Last Day. “And this is his wull wha sent me:— That ilk ane seein the Son, and lippenin on him, may win Life for Aye; and I sal raise him up at the Last Day.” Than the Jews yammerʼt at him, for that he said to them, “I am the Breid that cam doon frae Heeven.” Quoʼ they, “Isna this Jesus, Josephʼs son? Hoo isʼt than that he says he cam doon frae Heeven?” Sae Jesus answerʼt them, and quoʼ he, “Cavil‐na amang yersels. “Nae man comes to me, gin the  Faither wha sent me dinna draw him: and I wull raise him again at the Last Day. “The Prophets pat doon, ‘And God sal teach them aʼ.’ And sae ilk man wha hears, and has taen in the lear oʼ the Faither, comes to me. “No that ony man has eʼer set een on the Faither, only he wha is oʼ God — He has seen the Faither! “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Wha believes me has Life for Aye! “That Breid oʼ Life am I! “Yere forebears did eat manna iʼ the wilderness, and deeʼt. “But here is the Breid that cam doon frae Heeven, that a man may eat oʼ it, and no dee! “The Leevin Breid that cam doon frae Heeven is mysel; gin ony man eat this Breid, he leeves for Aye: and the breid I sal gie is my flesh, that I wull gie for the warldʼs life.” But the Jews had an unco bruilzie anent it, amang theirsels, and cryʼt oot, “Hoo can this man gie us his  flesh to eat?” Than quoʼ Jesus to them, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Gin ye eat‐na the flesh oʼ the Son oʼ Man, and drink his blude, thar is nae Life in ye! “Wha eats my flesh, and drinks my blude, wins Life Eternal; and him wull I raise again at the Last Day. “For my flesh is vera meat, and my blude is vera drink. “And wha eats my flesh and drinks my blude, bides in me, and I in him. “Eʼen as the Evir‐leevin Faither sends me, and I leeve by him, sae he wha eats oʼ me, sal eʼen leeve by me! “This is eʼen the Breid that cam doon frae Heeven; no like as yere forebears wha did eat manna, and deeʼt: wha eats oʼ this Breid leeves for aye!” Thir things said he iʼ the Synagogue, teachin in Capernaum. But a hantle oʼ his followers, whan they heard that, said: “Thae things are unco hard; wha can bide tae listen till them?” Jesus, kennin in himsel what his followers war mutterin aboot it, says to them, “Are ye angerʼt at this? “What, than, gin ye see the Son oʼ Man gang awa up whaur he was afore? “The Spirit gies folk life: the flesh is nae profit: my words that I gie ye are spirit and are life. “But thar are some oʼ ye wha dinna lippen me.” For Jesus kent frae the vera first wha was unbelievin, and wha wad betray him. And quoʼ he, “Sae it was I said tʼye, that nae man comes to me gin it warna gien him oʼ my Faither.” Frae that time oot, a hantle oʼ his followers reistit on him, and gaed nae mair wiʼ him. Than quoʼ Jesus to the Twalʼ, “Are ye gaun awa, too?” Quoʼ Simon Peter, “Wham soud we gang till? It is ye wha hae the words oʼ Eternal Life! “And we lippen and ken that ye are The Anointit Ane, the Son oʼ the Leevin God!” But quoʼ Jesus, “Hae I no waled oot ye twalʼ, and yet ane is a deevil?” He spak oʼ Judas Iscariot, Simonʼs son; for he it was that wad betray him, bein ane oʼ the Twalʼ. Eftir thae things, Jesus gaed up and doon aʼ Galilee; for he wadna gang iʼ the land oʼ Judea, for the Jews ettled to kill him. Noo the Jewsʼ Feast oʼ the Bothies was nar‐haun. Sae said his brethren to him, “Gang awa aff to Judea, sae that yere disciples may see yere warks that ye do! “For nae man dis siclike warks unkent, gin he ettles to be kent his sel. Gin ye do sic things, lat the warld see ye!” (For his brethren theirsels believed‐na in him). But quoʼ Jesus to them, “Itʼs no my time yet; your time is aye at haun! “The warld canna hate you: but it hates me, for I gie testimonie again it that its warks are ill. “Gang ye awa to this Feast: Iʼm no gaun e‐noo, for my timeʼs no here yet.” And syne, eftir thae words, he bade yet in Galilee. But eftir his brethren had gane up, he gaed up to the Feast as weel; no afore aʼ the folk, but like as it war hidlins. And the Jews war seekin him at the Feast; and quoʼ they, “Whaur is he?” And thar was an unco tulzie amang the folk anent him; for, quoʼ some, “Heʼs a gude man!” ithers said, “Na, heʼs but castin glamor ower the folk!” Hoosever, nane spak oot openly aboot him; for they war fleyʼt oʼ the Jews. Noo, aboot the mids oʼ the Feast‐time, Jesus gaed up intil the Temple to teach. And the Jews ferlied, and quoʼ they, “Hoo kens this man lear, yet he neʼer learned?” Jesus answered them, and quoʼ he, “The rede I redd isna mine, but his wha sent me. “Gin ony man do Godʼs wull, he sal ken aboot the rede, gin it be frae God, or gin I speak mysel, allenarlie. “Wha speaks allenar, oʼ his sel, seeks but his ain glorie; but wha seeks the glorie oʼ him that sent him, yon same man is leal and true; and nae fauseness in him. “Wasʼt no Moses that gied ye the law; and yet nane oʼ ye is keepinʼt. Hoo isʼt ye gang aboot to kill me?” The folk answerʼt, and quoʼ they, “Ye hae a demon; wha gang aboot to kill ye?” Quoʼ Jesus to them, “I hae dune ae wark, and ye aʼ ferlie. “Moses gied ye circumceesion (no that it is oʼ Moses, but raither oʼ the faithers), and on the Sabbath‐day ye circumceese ane. “Gin, than, ye on the Sabbath‐day circumceese a man, sae that Mosesʼ law be‐na broken, are ye angerʼt at me for makin a man ilka haet hale on the Sabbath‐day? “Judge‐na oʼ things as they seem to the ee, but judge richt judgment.” Than quoʼ some oʼ them oʼ Jerusalem, “Is this no he they seek to kill? “But look! he speaks out bauldly, and they say naething to him. Hae the rulers come to ken that this is the Anointit Ane? “But than we ken this man, and hoo he comes; but when the Anointit Ane sal come, nae  man kens hoo he comes!” Than cryʼt oot Jesus, teachin iʼ the Temple, “Ye baith ken me, and ye ken whaur I come frae. I am‐na come oʼ mysel; but he wha sent me is true — he wham ye ken‐na! “But I ken him; for I am frae him, and he sent me.” Than they socht to grip him; but as yet nae man pat hauns on him, for his ain ʼoor wasna yet come. And mony oʼ the folk lippenʼd on him; and quoʼ they, “Whan the Anointit comes, wull he do mair wunner‐warks than thae this man dis?” The Pharisees heard oʼ the folk mutterin sic things aboot him; and the Pharisees and the Heid‐priests sent oot officers to tak him. But Jesus gaed on — “Yet a wee while, and I am wʼye, afore I gang till him that sent me. “Ye may seek me, but ye winna finʼ me; and whaur I bide ye canna come!” Than quoʼ the Jews amang theirsels, “Whaur wull he gang that we canna finʼ him? Wull he gang awa to the here‐awa there‐awa tribes amang the Gentiles, teachin the Gentiles? “Whatna saying is this that he said, ‘Ye sal seek me, anʼ no finʼ me;’ and, ‘Whaur I bide ye canna come?’ ” Iʼ the hinmaist day, that great day oʼ the Feast, Jesus stude and cryʼt oot, “Gin ony man be drouthie, lat him eʼen come to me and drink! “He wha lippens on me, as it is putten doon iʼ the Scriptur, ‘Oot frae him sal flow rivers oʼ Leevin Watir!’ ” But this spak he oʼ the Spirit, that they sal see wha lippen on him; for the Holie Spirit wasna yet gien; for Jesus wasna yet glorifyʼt. And a hantle oʼ the folk, whan they heard aʼ this, said, “Surely this maun be the Prophet!” Ither wheen — “This is the Messiah!” But quoʼ some, “Sal the Messiah come oot oʼ Galilee? “Has the Scriptur no said, oot oʼ the toon oʼ Bethlehem, whaur Dauvid was?” Sae they war sindry iʼ their minds amang theirsels aboot him. And a wheen oʼ them wad fain hae laid haud oʼ him; but nae man pat haun on him. Than cam the officers back to the Heid‐priests and Pharisees, and quoʼ they to them, “Why hae ye no brocht him?” Quoʼ the officers, “Neʼer man spak like this man!” Quoʼ the Pharisees to them, “Are ye glamorʼd as weel? “Hae ony oʼ the Priests or the Pharisees lippened on him? “But a curse bides on this folk, wha ken‐na the law!” But quoʼ Nicodemus to them (the ane that cam till Jesus by nicht, and ane oʼ their sels), “Dis oor law condemn a man ʼor it hear him, and ken what he dis?” But they flang back at him, “Are ye oʼ Galilee too? Seek ye, and look — for oot oʼ Galilee comes nae Prophet!” And ilka man gaed till his ain hoose. Jesus gaed oot‐by till the Mount oʼ Olives. And on the morn, early, he cam again till the Temple, and the folk aʼ gaitherʼt aboot him; and he sat doon to teach them. And the Scribes and Pharisees brocht till him a wumman taʼen in adultery; and whan they had sutten her iʼ the mids, Quoʼ they to him, “Maister! this wumman was taʼen iʼ the vera act oʼ adultery. “Noo Moses, iʼ the Law, gied commaun to stane siclike; but what say ye?” This said they for temptation, to hae something to wyte him wiʼ. But Jesus loutit doon, and gaed on writin in the yird wiʼ his fingʼer. Sae whan they gaed on, ask‐askin him, he straughtit his sel, and quoʼ he to them, “The ane thatʼs wantin sin amang ye, lat him cast the first stane at her!” And ance mair he loutit his sel doon, writin on the grunʼ. And they that heard him slippit cannilie oot, frae the auldest eʼen to the last ane; and Jesus was left alane, wiʼ the wumman staunin iʼ the mids. Whan Jesus straughtit his sel up, and saw nane but the wumman, he says to her, “Whaur are they that wytit ye? Has nae man gien judgment on ye?” And she says, “Nae man, my Lord!” And quoʼ Jesus, “Nae mair div I pass judgment on ye: gang yere ways, and sin nae mair!” Than again spak Jesus to them, and said, “I am the warldʼs Licht! the man wha follows me walks‐na iʼ the mirk, but sal hae the licht oʼ Life!” The Pharisees then replied to him, “Ye gie witness oʼ yersel; yere ain witness, allenar, is nae prufe!” Jesus answerʼt them, and quoʼ he, “Eʼen gin I bear witness for mysel, my witness is leal and true; for I ken whaur I cam frae, and whaur I gang till: but ye ken‐na whaur I cam frae, and whaur I gang. Ye judge eftir the flesh; I judge nane. “Aye, and gin I did judge, my judgment wad be true; for it isna I mylane, but I and the Faither wha sent me. “And eʼen iʼ yere ain Law itʼs putten‐doon, ‘The witness oʼ twa witnesses is prufe.’ “I am ane, giean witness oʼ mysel; and the Faither wha sent me gies witness oʼ me.” Than said they to him, “Whaur is yere Faither?” Quoʼ Jesus, “Ye ken‐na me, nor ken ye my Faither; gin ye kent me, ye soud hae kent my Faither as weel!” Thir words spak Jesus iʼ the Treasury, as he was teachin iʼ the Temple; and nae man put hauns on him, for his ʼoor wasna yet. Than again Jesus says to them, “I gang my ways; and ye sal seek for me, and sal dee iʼ yere sins; and whaur I gang, ye canna come!” Than quoʼ the Jews, “Wull he mak awa wiʼ his sel? for he says, ‘Whaur I gang, ye canna come.’ ” And he said to them, “Ye are frae aneath; I am frae Aboon; ye are but oʼ this warld; I am‐na oʼ this warld. “Sae said I tʼye, ‘Iʼ yere sins ye sal dee!’ for gin ye believe‐na that I am the Ane, ye sal dee iʼ yere sins!” Than speirʼt they at him, “Wha are ye?” And Jesus says to them, “Eʼen juist as I said to ye at the first. “Mony things hae I to say, and mony things hae I to judge oʼ ye; natheless, he wha sent me is true; and I gie to the warld what I hae heard oʼ him.” They kent‐na that he spak to them oʼ the Faither. Than said Jesus to them, “Whan ye hae up‐liftit the Son oʼ Man, ye sal ken I am he, and do naething oʼ mysel; but oʼ the lear oʼ my Faither, sae speak I thae things. “And he is aye wiʼ me wha sent me: the Faither leaves‐me‐na alane; for I aye dae the things that please him.” And speakin thir words, mony believed on him. Than said Jesus to thae Jews wha had lippened him, “Gin ye bide in my word, than are ye my followers truly. “And the truth sal ye ken, and the truth maks ye free.” But they answered him, “Abraʼmʼs seed are we, and nar war slaves to ony: hoo say ye than, ‘Ye sal be made free?’ ” Jesus says to them, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Wha works sin, is sinʼs servant! “And the servin‐man bides‐na iʼ the hoose for aye; but the Son bides for aye. “Gin than the Son maks ye free, truly yeʼse be free! “I ken ye are oʼ the seed oʼ Abraʼm; but ye are seekin to mak awa wiʼ me, for that my word bides‐na in ye. “What I hae seen wiʼ my Faither I speak; and what ye hae heard frae yere faither ye do!” They answered, and quoʼ they to him, “Abraʼm is oor Faither!” Jesus says to them, “Gin ye war Abraʼmʼs bairns, ye wad do Abraʼmʼs warks. “But noo ye wad mak’ awa wiʼ me, a man wha tells ye the truth, whilk I hae heard oʼ God: Abraʼm did‐na sae! “Ye dae yere faitherʼs warks!” Than said they to him, “We be‐na oʼ fornication; we hae ae Faither, God!” Jesus said to them, “Gin God war yere Faither, ye wad eʼen loʼe me: for I cam forth and cam frae God; and I cam‐na oʼ mysel, but he sent me. “Why dae ye no ken my sayin? eʼen for that ye canna hear my word? “Ye are oʼ yere faither the deevil; and his wull dae ye. A murderer was he frae the first, and bade‐na iʼ the truth. And whan he speaks a lee, he speaks oʼ his ain; for he is a leear, and the faither oʼ aʼ leears. “And for that I tell ye the truth, ye lippen‐na on me. “Wha oʼ ye fastens sin on me? And, gin I say the truth, why isʼt ye lippen‐na on me? “He that is oʼ God, hears Godʼs words: ye dinna hear them, tharfor, for ye are‐na oʼ God!” Than answerʼt the Jews, and quoʼ they, “Dae we no say weel that ye are a Samaritan, and hae a deevil!” Jesus answerʼt, “I hae nae deevil: but I honor my Faither, and ye wad dishonour me. “And I seek‐na for my ain glorie; thar is Ane that seeks and judges. “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Gin a man keep my sayin, he sal neʼer see death!” Than said the Jews to him, “Noo ken we ye hae a deevil; for Abrʼam is deid, and the Prophets are deid; and ye say, ‘Gin a man keep my sayin, he sal neʼer pree oʼ death.’ “Are ye greater nor oor faither Abraʼm, wha is deid? and the Prophets that are deid; wham wad ye mak yersel?” Jesus answerʼt, “Gin I glorifyʼt mysel, my glorie is but naething; it is my Faither wha glorifies me; wham ye caʼ yere God. “Yet hae ye no kent him; but I ken him; and gin I soud say, ‘I dinna ken him,’ I soud be a leear, like as ye are yersels: but I ken him, and keep his word. “Yere faither Abraʼm was fain to see my day; and he saw it, and it blythened him!” Than said the Jews to him, “Ye are‐na  fifty year auld yet, and hae ye seen Abraʼm?” Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Afore Abraʼm was, am I!” Than grippit they stanes to hurl at him; but Jesus hid his sel, and gaed oot oʼ the Temple, throwe amang them aʼ, awa. And as he gaed by he saw a man wha was blinʼ frae he was born. And his disciples speirʼt at him, “Maister! whase sin wasʼt? the manʼs ain sin, or his faither and mitherʼs, that he was born blinʼ?” Jesus answerʼt, “Naither his ain sin, nor his faitherʼs and mitherʼs; but for that the warks oʼ God soud be seen in him. “I maun do the warks oʼ him that sent me, while it is day: the nicht comes on, when man canna work. “While I am in the warld, I am the warldʼs licht.” Whan he had said this, he spat on the grunʼ, and made clay oʼ the spittle, and pat the clay on the blinʼ manʼs een. And bad him “Gang awa, wesh ye in the pool oʼ Siloam” (whilk means “Sent”). He gaed his gate tharfor, and weshʼt, and cam back seein. Than the neebors, and the folk that afore had seen him, and kent the beggar, said, “Isna this the ane that sat and beggit?” Some again, “It is he!” Ithers, “Itʼs like him!” Quoʼ he, “I am he!” Sae they speirʼt at him, “Hoo than are yere een unsteekit?” He answerʼt, and quoʼ he, “The man they caʼ Jesus made clay, and pat it on my een, and tellʼt me, ‘Gang yere ways to the Pool oʼ Siloam, and wesh ye!’ And I gaed and I weshʼt, and I gat my sicht.” And quoʼ they to him, “Whaur is he?” He said, “I ken‐na.” They fesh till the Pharisees the man that oʼ auld time was blinʼ. Noo it was the Sabbath, the day that Jesus wrocht the clay, and unsteekit the manʼs een. Ance mair the Pharisees speirʼt at him, hoo he had gotten his sicht? Quoʼ he, “He pat clay on my een, and I weshʼt — and I see!” Sae quoʼ some oʼ the Pharisees, “This man is no oʼ God, for he keeps‐na the Sabbath!” Quoʼ ithers, “Hoo can a man fuʼ oʼ sin do sic wunner‐warks?” And thar was contention amang them. Than said they again to the man that was blinʼ, “What say ye aboot him, sinʼ he has openʼd yere eʼen?” Quoʼ he, “He is a Prophet!” But the Jews wadna believe — anent the manʼs bein blinʼ, and winnin to his sicht — till they caʼd the parents oʼ him that had gotten his sicht. And they speirʼt at them, “Is this yere son, wha, as ye say, was born blinʼ? Hoo than is he noo seein?” His parents answerʼt, and quoʼ they, “We ken weel that this is oor son; and that he was born blinʼ; “But hoo he noo sees, or wha has unsteekit his een, we kenna: he is come to age; speir at him: he his ain sel wull tell ye.” Thir things spak the parents, for that they war fleyʼt oʼ the Jews; for the Jews had plottit amang theirsels, that gin ony man soud own him to be the Christ, he soud be putten oot oʼ the kirk. And sae said his parents, “He is come to age; speir at him!” Sae they caʼd back again the man that had been blinʼ, and quoʼ they to him, “Gie the praise to God! we aʼ ken that this man is no a gude man.” But quoʼ he to them, “Gin he be a gude man or an ill man, I kenna; ae thing I dae ken, that ance I was blinʼ, and noo I see!” And than again they said to him, “What wasʼt he did till ye? Hoo did he unsteek yere een?” He answerʼt, “I tellʼt ye juist e‐noo, and ye didna hear me! Why wad ye hear it ower again? wull ye be his disciples?” And they miscaʼt him, and said, “Ye are his disciple! but we are Mosesʼ disciples! “We ken that God has spoken to Moses; as for this ane, we kenna whaur he is frae!” The man answerʼt, and quoʼ he, “Why, here is an unco ferlie; that ye kenna whaur he is come frae, and yet he has unsteekit my een! “We ken that God hears‐na ill men; but gin ane worships God, and dis his wull, him he hears. “Sinʼ the warld begude was it neʼer heard that ony ane unsteekit the een oʼ a man born blinʼ! “Gin this man  warna oʼ God, he coud do naething!” They answerʼt, and quoʼ they to him, “Ye war born in sin, oot and oot; and wad ye teach us?” And they cuist him oot. Jesus was tellʼt that they had cuisten him oot; and as sune as he faund him he says to him, “Dae ye believe on the Son oʼ God?” He answerin said, “And wha is he, Lord? sae as I may believe on him?” Jesus says to him, “Ye hae baith seen him, and it is he wha is speakin wʼye!” And he cryʼt oot, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshippʼt him. And quoʼ Jesus, “For judgment cam I tae this warld; that the blinʼ may see, and the seein be made blinʼ.” And thae oʼ the Pharisees that war wiʼ him heard thir words, and quoʼ they to him, “Are we blinʼ, as weel?” Jesus says to them, “Gin ye war blinʼ, the sin wadna be on ye; but noo ye say, ‘We see!’ yere sin is whaur it was!” “Truly, truly say I tʼye, He wha comes‐na ben by the door intil the fauld, but speels up by some gate oʼ his ain, is but a thief and a reiver. “But he wha comes ben by the door is the herd oʼ the sheep. “To him the keeper unsteeks the fauld; and the sheep hear his voice; and he caʼs by name his ain sheep, and taks them oot. “And whan he has letten oot his ain, he gangs afore them, and the sheep follow him, for they ken his voice. “But nae fremd‐ane wull they follow; for they kenna the voice oʼ fremd folk.” This parable spak Jesus to them; but they kent‐na what he spak to them aboot. Than Jesus spak to them again, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, I am the door oʼ the sheep! “Aʼ that eʼer cam afore me are but thieves and reivers; but the sheep heard‐them‐na. “I am the door; gin ony man come ben by me, he sal be saved, and sal gang oot and in, and fend weel. “The reiver comes‐na but for to steal, and kill, and ding doon. I come that they may hae life, and mair rowth oʼt. “I am the Gude Shepherd; the gude shepherd gies his ain life for his sheep. “But the orra man for a fee, wha isna the herd, and auchts‐na the sheep, whan he sees the wolf comin doon, leaʼs them and flees; and the wolf grips them, and skails them abreid. “The orra man flees, for that he is but for a fee, and loʼes‐na the sheep. “I am the Gude Shepherd, and ken my ain, and my ain ken me. “And the Faither kens me, and I ken the Faither; and I gie my ain life for the sheep. “And ither sheep hae I, no oʼ this fauld: them too maun I bring hame, and they sal ken my voice; and they sal win to be ae flock, wiʼ ae Shepherd! “And for this dis my Faither loʼe me, for that I lay doon my life, that I micht tak it again. “Nae man rives it frae me, but I lay it doon oʼ mysel. I hae strenth to lay it doon, and strenth to tak it up again. This commaun hae I oʼ my Faither.” Thar was a bruilzie ance mair amang the Jews at thir sayins. And a hantle oʼ them said, “He has a demon, and is wud; why listen ye to him?” Ither some — “This are‐na the words oʼ ane wiʼ a demon! Can a demon unsteek the een oʼ the blinʼ?” And it was at the Feast oʼ The Dedication, in Jerusalem: it was winter; And Jesus was gaun in Solomonʼs Porch, iʼ the Temple. Than the Jews cam aboot him, sayin, “Hoo lang dae ye keep us in a swither? Gin ye be the Christ, lat us ken plainly!” Jesus answerʼt, “I tellʼt ye, and ye wadna believe; the  ferlies that I dae in my Faitherʼs name, bear witness oʼ me. “But ye believe‐na, for that ye arena oʼ my sheep. “My sheep hear my voice, and I ken them, and they follow me. “And I wull gie Eternal Life to them, and nane sal rive them oot oʼ my haun. “My Faither, wha has gien them to me, is michtier nor I, and nane is fit to rive them oot oʼ my Faitherʼs haun. “I and my Faither are ane.” The Jews gatherʼt up stanes to stane him. Jesus answerʼt them, “Mony are the gude warks I hae schawed ye frae my Faither; for whilk oʼ thae dae ye stane me?” The Jews answerʼt, and quoʼ they, “For nae gude wark div we stane ye! but for blasphemin; and for that ye, a man, are makin yersel God!” Jesus answerʼt, “Isʼt no putten doon iʼ yere Law, ‘I said ye are gods?’ “Gin he caʼd them gods, till wham the word oʼ God cam — and the Scriptur isna to be broken — “Say ye oʼ him the Faither consecrates, and sends into the warld, ‘Ye blaspheme!’ for that I said, ‘I am the Son oʼ God?’ “Gin I div‐na the works oʼ my Faither, dinna believe me! “But gin I div them — eʼen gin ye believe‐na me, believe the warks! sae ye may ken and may believe that the Faither is in me, and I am in the Faither!” Than they ettled again to grip him; but he gaed forth oot oʼ their haun, And gaed awa again ayont the Jordon, to the place whaur John was at first bapteezin: and he bade thar. And mony folk cam till him; and quoʼ they, “John schawed nae ferlies; but aʼ things that John spak aboot this man war true!” And mony believed on him thar. Noo, a particular ane was ill; Lazarus, oʼ Bethanie; Maryʼs toon, and her sister Marthaʼs toon. It was the same Mary wha anointit the Lord wiʼ the ointment, and dightit his feet wiʼ her hair, whase brither Lazarus was ill. Sae his sisters sent word to him, “Lord, see! the lad ye loʼe is sick!” Whan Jesus heard it, he said, “This illness is no to bring death, but the glorie oʼ God; sae as Godʼs Son micht be glorifyʼt.” Noo Jesus had tender love for Mary, and her sister, and Lazarus. Whan, than, he heard he was ill, he ye bade thar twa days iʼ the bit whaur he was. Eftir that, quoʼ he to his disciples, “Lat us gang into Judea again!” The disciples say to him, “Maister! the Jews eʼen noo ettled to stane ye, and wull ye gang thar‐awa again?” Jesus answerʼt, “Are thar no twalʼ oors to a day? Gin ony man gang iʼ the day, he stoiters‐na, for that he sees the licht oʼ this warld. “But gin ane walk iʼ the nicht, he stoiters, for that the licht isna in him.” Thir things quoʼ he; and eftir he said to them, “Oor freend Lazarus is faun on sleep; but I gang that I may wauken him oot oʼ sleep!” Than quoʼ the disciples, “Lord, gin he sleep, he maun be on the mend!” But Jesus spak oʼ his deein; while they thocht he had spoken oʼ his takin rest in sleep. Than said Jesus plainly to them, “Lazarus is deid! “And I am weel pleased, for yere sakes, I wasna yonner, sae as ye may believe; nane‐the‐less, lat us gang to him!” Than Tammas (he wha was caʼd “The Twin”) says to his neebors, “Lat us aʼ gang, too, that we may  dee wiʼ him!” Than, when Jesus cam, he faund he had been iʼ the tomb for fowr days. Noo, Bethanie was nar‐haun Jerusalem, no twa mile awa. And mony folk oʼ the Jews had come oot to Martha and Mary to console them ower their brither. Than Martha, as sune as she kent Jesus was comin, gaed oot and met him; but Mary sat yet iʼ the hoose. Sae says Martha to Jesus, “Lord! gin thou had been here, my brither hadna deeʼt! “And eʼen yet, I ken that whateʼer thou may ask oʼ God, God wull gie it thee!” Quoʼ Jesus to her, “Yere brither sal rise again!” Martha says to him, “I ken he sal rise again, iʼ the Risin at the Last Day!” Jesus said to her, “I am the Risin‐again and the Life! Wha lippens on me, eʼen gin he dee, yet sal he leeve! “And whasae leeves, lippenin on me, sal dee nae mair! Dae ye believe this?” Quoʼ she to him, “Aye, Lord! I believe thou art Godʼs Son, wha was to come intil the warld!” And whan she had said this, she gaed her ways, and caʼd Mary her sister, unkent, sayin, “The Maister is come, and is seekinʼ ye!” And as sune as she kent it, she raise quickly, and gaed till him. Noo Jesus wasna yet come to the toon, but was iʼ the place whaur Martha met him. Sae the Jews wha war iʼ the hoose to console her, whan they saw Mary rise up oʼ a suddaintie and gang oot, followʼt her, sayin amang theirsels, “She gangs to the tomb, to wail thar!” Than Mary, bein come whaur Jesus was, fell doon at his feet, sayin to him, “Lord! gin thou had been here, my brither hadna deeʼt!” Whan Jesus saw her sabbin, and the Jews aʼ greetin that cam wiʼ her, he was unco touched at the heart, and was wrocht‐on. And quoʼ he, “Whaur hae ye laid him doon?” They say to him, “Lord, come awa and see!” Jesus grat. The Jews than said, “See hoo he loʼed him!” But a wheen oʼ them said, “Coud‐na this man, wha unsteekit the een oʼ the blinʼ, hae caused eʼen this man to leeve?” Jesus,  groanin at this within his sel, comes to the tomb. Noo it was a cave, and a stane was putten ower it. Jesus said, “Tak ye awa the stane!” Martha, the sister oʼ the deid man, says, “Lord! by noo the corp wull be rank, for he has been fowr days deid!” Jesus says to her, “Did I no say tʼye, that gin ye wad believe, ye soud see the glorie oʼ God?” Than took they awa the stane. And Jesus liftit up his een, and said, “Faither! I thank thee that thou did hear me. “And I ken that thou aye hears me; but for the sake oʼ aʼ the folk staunin here I said it, that they may ken that thou did send me.” And whan he had sae said, he cryʼt wiʼ a soondin voice, “Lazarus! hither! Come!” And the deid cam forth, bund haun and fit wiʼ deid‐claes; and his heid bund roond wiʼ a naipkin. Jesus says to them, “Lowse him, and lat him gang!” Than a hantle oʼ the Jews wha cam to Mary, and saw aʼ that he did, believed on him; But a wheen oʼ them gaed their gate to the Pharisees, and tellʼt them what Jesus had dune. The Heigh‐priests and the Pharisees than gaitherʼt a Cooncil; and quoʼ they, “What are we to do? for this man dis mony wunner‐warks. “Gin we lat him thus be, aʼ folk wull lippen to him; and the Romans wull come, and tak’ awa oor place and oor kintra frae us!” But ane oʼ them, Caiaphas, he bein Heigh‐priest that year, said to them, “Ye ken naething ava! “Nor tak intil accoont, that it is better for us that ae man soud dee for the nation, and no that the hail nation soud be cuttit aff!” Noo this he spak, no oʼ his ain sel; but bein Heigh‐priest that year, he foretauld that Jesus soud dee for the nation: And no for that nation allenarlie; but that he soud gather thegither in ane aʼ Godʼs bairns scatterʼt abreid. Sae, frae that day forrit, they plottit thegither to mak awa wiʼ him. Sae Jesus gaed nae mair freely amang the Jews; but gaed awa intil the kintra‐side nar‐haun the wilderness, intil a city caʼd Ephraim; and bade thar, wiʼ his disciples. Noo the Jewsʼ Pasche was nar‐haun; and mony gaed up frae aʼ the kintra‐side to Jerusalem afore the Pasche, to purify their sels. Than socht they for Jesus; and quoʼ they amang their sels, as they stude iʼ the Temple, “What think ye? wull he no come up to the Feast?” Noo baith the Heigh‐priests and the Pharisees had gien a commaun, that gin ony ane kent whaur he was, he soud schaw it, that they micht grip him. Than Jesus, six days afore the Pasche, cam to Bethanie, whaur was Lazarus, that he had raised frae the deid. And they made him a supper; and Martha serʼt at the table; but Lazarus sat wiʼ him, amang the guests. Than Mary took a pund oʼ ointment, the raal nard, unco precious, and anointit Jesusʼ feet; and dichtit his feet wiʼ her hair; and the hail hoose was fuʼ oʼ the perfume oʼ the ointment. But ane oʼ his disciples, Judas, says (he wha wad betray him), “Hoo isʼt this ointment wasna raither sellʼt for thrie hunder siller pennies, and gien to the puir?” Noo this said he, no that he cared ocht for the puir, but for that he was a thief, and bure the wallet, and made awa wiʼ what gaed intilʼt. Than said Jesus, “Dinna pit her aboot! has she no been hainin it for my buryin day? “For ye hae aye the puir wʼye; but ye haena me aye wʼye!” The feck oʼ the folk amang the Jews kent he was thar; and they cam oot, no for Jesusʼ sake allenarlie; but eʼen to see Lazarus as weel, wham he had raised frae the deid. But the Heigh‐priests socht hoo they micht mak awa wiʼ Lazarus as weel; For that by reason oʼ him, a hantle oʼ the Jews gaed awa, believin on Jesus On the morn, a great companie oʼ folk, wha had come to the Feast, whan they heard say that Jesus was comin to Jerusalem, Tuik branches oʼ the palm‐trees, and gaed oot to meet him, and cryʼt oot, “Hosannah! Blessin on him wha comes iʼ the name oʼ the Lord! the King oʼ Israel!” And Jesus, whan he had taʼen a young ass, sut himsel onʼt; as it is putten doon, “Fear‐na, O dochter oʼ Zion! for see, yere King comes, sittin on an assʼs cowt.” Thir things did‐na his disciples think oʼ at the first; but whan Jesus was glorifyʼt, than mindit they that thir things war putten‐doon anent him, and that they had dune thir things to him. Sae the thrang oʼ folk that war wiʼ him whan he caʼd Lazarus frae the tomb, and raised him frae the deid, bure witness. And for this cause the haill multitude gaed oot to meet him, for they had heard tell that he had dune this great ferlie. Than the Pharisees said amang their sels, “See ye hoo ye mak nae heidway! Look! the warld is gane eftir him!” Noo, thar war certain Greeks amang the folk that cam up to worship at the Feast. And thir men cam to Philip, wha was oʼ Bethsaida oʼ Galilee, sayin to him, “Sir, we wad fain see Jesus!” Philip cam and tellʼt Andro; and than Andro and Philip tellʼt Jesus. And Jesus answerʼt them, and quoʼ he, “The ʼoor is come for the Son oʼ Man to be glorifyʼt. “Truly, truly say I tʼye, gin a pickle oʼ wheat faʼna into the yirth and dee, it bides allenar; but gin it dee, it brings muckle increase. “Wha loʼes his life, sal tine his life; and wha hains‐na his life iʼ this warld sal hain it for Eternity! “Gin ony man wad serʼ me, lat him follow me; and whaur I bide, thar sal my servant bide; gin ony man serʼ me, my Father wull gie him honor. “And noo is my saul unco wanrestie; and what sal I say? Faither! save me frae this ʼoor! But eʼen for this cam I intil this ʼoor! “Faither, glorify thy name!” Than cam thar a sough oʼ a voice oot oʼ the lift, sayin, “I hae baith glorifyʼt it, and wull again glorify it!” Aʼ the folk, tharfor, that stude by, said it thunnerʼt. But ither some, that “An Angel spak to him!” Jesus answerʼt, and said to them, “This voice cam‐na for my sake, but for yours. “Noo is the  turnin‐point for this warld: noo sal this warldʼs prince be cuisten oot! “And I, gin I be liftit up frae the yirth, wull wyle aʼ men to me!” This said he, meanin whatna kind oʼ death he wad dee. And aʼ the folk answerʼt him, “We hae heard oot oʼ the Law that the Anointit Ane bides for aye; and hoo say ye, ‘The Son oʼ Manʼs to be upliftit?’ Wha is this Son oʼ Man?” Than cryʼt Jesus to them, “Yet for a wee while is the licht wiʼ ye. Walk ye while ye hae the licht, that the mirk faʼ na on ye; for wha gangs iʼ the mirk kens‐na whaur he is gaun. “Whilst ye hae the licht, believe iʼ the licht; sae sal ye be bairns oʼ the licht!” Thir things spak Jesus, and gaʼed awa, and keepit his sel hidlins frae them. But eftir doin sae mony great warks amang them, yet believed‐they‐na on him; That the saying oʼ Esaiah the Prophet micht come gude whan he said, “Lord, wha has lippened to oor word? And by wham has Jehovahʼs airm been seen?” Tharfor, they didna believe, for that Esaiah said again, “Their eʼen are blindit, and their heart made hard; that they soudna see wiʼ their eʼen, nor understaun wiʼ their heart, and be turned, and I soud heal them!” Thir things quoʼ Esaiah whan he saw his glorie, and spak oʼ him. Nane‐the‐less, eʼen amang the Heigh‐priests, a hantle believed on him; but being fleyʼt oʼ the Pharisees, they didna own him, for fear they soud be putten oot oʼ the Kirk. For they loʼed to be roosʼd oʼ men mair nor to be commendit oʼ God. Jesus cryʼt, an quoʼ he, “Wha believes on me, believes na on me allenarlie, but on him wha sent me. “And wha looks on me, looks on him wha sent me. “I am come for a licht to the warld, that wha believes on me soud nae mair bide iʼ the mirk. “And gin ony man hear to my words, and winna keep them, I judge‐him‐na; for it wasna to judge the warld, but to save the warld that I cam. “Wha winna hear me, and winna hae my words, has ane to judge him: the word I hae gien oot, that sal condemn him iʼ the Last Day. “For I haena spoken by mysel; but the Faither wha sent me, he gied it to me, what I soud gie oot, and what I should speak. “And I ken his commaun is Life‐for‐Aye: that whilk I speak, tharfor, eʼen as the Faither has said to me, sae I speak.” Noo, afore the Pasche, Jesus kennin that his ʼoor cam on, whan he soud gang oot frae this warld to the Faither — as he had loʼed his ain iʼ the warld, he loʼed them to the hinmaist. And the Supper gaun on, the Enemy haen noo putten intil the heart oʼ Judas Iscariot, Simonʼs son, to betray him — Jesus, kennin that the Faither had gien aʼ thing intil his hauns, and that frae God he cam, and to God was returnin, Gat up frae Supper, and lay doon his robes, and girded his sel wiʼ a tooel, And syne he teemed watir intil a basin, and begude to wesh the disciplesʼ feet, and to dight them wiʼ the tooel aboot him. And belyve he cam to Simon Peter: he says to him, “Lord! wad ye wesh my feet?” Jesus answerʼt to him, “Ye kenna e‐noo what I dae, but ye sal ken eftir.” Peter says, “Nevir, and in naegate, sal ye wesh my feet!” Jesus answerʼt him, “Gin I wesh‐ye‐na, ye hae nae pairt wiʼ me!” Simon Peter says to him, “Lord! no my feet, allenar, but my hauns and my heid as weel!” Jesus says to him, “Wha is clean, needs‐na but his feet weshʼt to be aʼ clean; and ye are clean — but no aʼ!” For he kent wha wad betray him; sae said he, “Ye arena aʼ clean.” Sae whan he had weshʼt their feet, and taʼen his robe to him, and taʼen his place again, he said to them, “Ken ye what I hae dune to ye? “Ye caʼ me ‘Maisterʼ and ‘Lord’; and ye say weel; for sae I am. “Gin I than, the Lord and the Maister, hae mysel weshʼt yere feet, ye soud be weshin ane anitherʼs feet. “For I hae sutten ye an example, to do as I hae dune tʼye. “Truly, truly say I tʼye, a servant isna aboon his maister, nor the ane that is sent oot as great as as the ane wha sends him. “Gin ye ken thir things, happy are ye to be doin them! “I speak‐na aboot ye aʼ; I ken wham I hae waled oot; but that the word soud come to pass, ‘He wha eats my breid lifts up his heel again me!’ “And frae noo I am tellin ye aforehaun; sae whan it is come to pass, ye may believe I am he. “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Wha welcomes ony ane I send, welcomes me; and wha welcomes me, welcomes him that sent me.” Sayin thir things, Jesus was wrocht‐on in his spirit, and quoʼ he, “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Ane frae ʼmang yere sels sal betray me!” Than the disciples glowerʼt at ane anither, dootsome aboot wham he micht be speakin. Noo, leanin on Jesusʼ bosom, was ane oʼ his disciples, ane that Jesus loʼed. Simon Peter than raxes ower to him, and says, “Tell us wham he is speakin oʼ.” He, leanin back on Jesusʼ breist, says to him, “Lord! wha isʼt?” Jesus answerʼt him, “It is he to wham I sal dip the morsel, and gie it.” And he dippit the morsel, and gied it to Judas Iscariot, Simonʼs Son. And eftir the morsel, Sautan cam intil his heart. Than Jesus says to him, “Whateʼer ye dae, haste wiʼt.” Noo, nae man at the Supper kent what‐for he spak this to him. For some thocht, seein Judas bure the wallet, that Jesus had tellʼt him, “Buy what we need anent the Feast”; or that he was to gie to the puir. He than, receivin the morsel, syne gaed oot; and it was nicht. Sae, noo he was gane oot, Jesus says, “Noo the Son oʼ Man is glorifyʼt, and God glorifyʼt in him. “Gin God be glorifyʼt in him, God sal eʼen glorify him in himsel, and sal noo glorify him. “Bairns, I am wiʼ you but for a wee. Ye sal seek me, and, like as I tellʼt the Jews, sae speak I noo — Whaur I gang, ye canna come! “I gie ye a new commaun, ‘Ye sal loʼe ane‐anither; eʼen  as I hae loeʼd you, that ye soud loʼe ane‐anither!’ “Sae sal aʼ folk ken ye are followers oʼ me, gin ye hae love to ane‐anither.” Simon Peter says to him, “Lord! whaur dae ye gang to?” Jesus answerʼt to him, “Whaur‐awa I gang, ye canna follow me e‐noo; but ye sal follow me eftir.” Quoʼ Peter to him, “Hoo isʼt I canna follow ye e‐noo? Iʼse lay doon my life for ye!” But Jesus answerʼt, “Wull ye lay doon yere life for me? Truly, truly say I tʼye, the cock craws‐na, till ye hae thrice disowned me!” “Be ye‐na cuisten‐doon in heart; ye lippen on God; lippen on me as weel. “My Faitherʼs Hoose has mony bowers; if no, I wad hae tellʼt ye. I gang to busk a place for ye. “And gin I gang to busk a place for ye, sae come I again, and tak ye to mysel; that whaur I bide, ye may bide. “And whaur I gang, ye ken; and the gate ye ken.” Quoʼ Tammas to him, “Lord! we dinna ken whaur yeʼre gaun, and hoo can we ken the gate?” Quoʼ Jesus to him, “I am the gate, the Truth, and the Life! ilka man wha comes to the Faither, comes throwe me. “Gin ye had kent me, ye soud hae kent my Faither as weel; and frae this forrit ye ken him, and hae seen him.” Quoʼ Philip to him, “Lord, schaw us the Faither, and we sal be content!” Jesus says to him, “Hae I been sae lang wʼye, and eʼen yet ye haena kent me, Philip? Wha  sees me, sees the Faither. And hoo dʼye say, ‘Schaw us the Faither?’ “Canna ye lippen me, that I am in the Faither, and the Faither in me? And the words I speak tʼye, I speak no allenarlie and oʼ mysel; but the Faither, wha bides in me, eʼen he dis the warks. “Lippen me — I am in the Faither, and the Faither is in me; or eʼen lippen me for the warks their sels! “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Wha believes on me sal do my warks, and eʼen greater; for I gang awa tae my Faither. “And aʼ that ye ask in my name, eʼen that wull I do, that the Faither micht be glorifyʼt iʼ the Son. “Gin ye ask ocht in my name, that wull I do. “Gin ye loʼe me, keep my commauns! “And I sal pray to the Faither, and he sal gie ye anither Guide, that he may be wiʼ ye for aye — “The Spirit oʼ aʼ Truth — wham the world receives‐na, for it sees him‐na, nor yet kens him. Ye ken him, for he bides wʼye, and sal be in ye. “I winna leaʼ ye to yersels, I come tʼye. “Yet a wee, and the warld sees me nae mair; but ye see me: seein I leeve, ye sal leeve. “At that day ye sal ken that I am in the Faither — ye in me, and I in you! “The man wha kens my commauns, and has keepit them, is the ane that loʼes me; and my Faither loʼes him that loʼes me — and I wull loʼe him, and schaw mysel to him.” Judas says to him (no Iscariot), “Lord! hoo isʼt ye are to schaw yersel to us, and no to the warld?” Quoʼ Jesus to them, “Gin a man loʼes me, he keeps my words, and my Faither wull loʼe him; and we wull come to him, and bide wiʼ him. “Wha loʼes‐me‐na keeps‐na my words; and the word ye hear is no allenarlie mine, but the Faitherʼs wha sent me. “Aʼ thir things I hae spoken tʼye, while I forgatherʼt wiʼ ye. “But the Guide, the Holie Spirit, wham the Faither sends in my name, he sal eʼen learn ye aʼ things, and fesh aʼ things up to yere mind, whatsoeʼer I hae said to ye. “Peace I leaʼ wiʼ ye; my peace I gie ye; no as the warld wad gie, gie I tʼye. Dinna lat yere heart be dowie, nor be ye fleyʼt. “Ye hae heard tell hoo I said tʼye, ‘I gang awa, and come again!’ Gin ye loʼed me, ye wad be blythe to hear me say, ‘I gang to the Faither!’ for my Faither is mair nor I. “Sae noo I hae tellʼt ye, afore it is come, that whan it is come ye soud believe. “And frae this on, Iʼll no say muckle to ye: for this warldʼs Prince comes; but has nae haud oʼ me! “But I speak, that the warld may come to ken that I loʼe the Faither; and as the Faither commandit, eʼen sae I dae. Come, lat us gang awa!” I am the richt Vine‐stock, and my Faither is the Dresser oʼ the Vine‐yaird. “Ilka branch in me that bears‐na frute he taks awa; and ilka ane bearin frute he prunes it, sae as it soud produce the mair. “Noo ye hae been sae pruned, by the word I hae spoken tʼye. “Bide in me, as I bide in you. The branch canna bear frute allenarlie; it maun bide in the Vine‐stock: nae mair may ye, gin ye bide‐na in me. “I am the Vine‐stock; ye are the Branches. He wha bides in me, and I bide in him, that man brings forth rowth oʼ frute: for wantin me ye naething can do. “Gin ony man  bide‐na in me, he is cuisten oot as a fushionless branch, and dwines awa; and folk soop them thegither, and set them alowe, and they are brunt. “But gin ye bide in me, and my words bide in you, ask ye what ye wad hae, and it sal be dune tʼye! “And this gate is my Faither made glorious — that ye dae bear rowth oʼ frute: sae are ye my disciples! “Eʼen as the Faither has loʼed me, sae eʼen hae I loʼed you: bide ye in my love. “And gin ye keep my commauns, ye sal bide in my love; eʼen as I, keepin my Faitherʼs commauns, bide aye in his love. “Thir things hae I said tʼye, sae as my joy sal bide wiʼ ye, and yere joy be fuʼ and skailin ower. “Here is my commaun — That ye loʼe ilk ither, eʼen as I loʼed you. “Nae man has evir mair love than this — to lay doon his life for his freends. “Noo ye are my freends, gin ye do my commauns. “And frae this oot, I dinna caʼ ye servants, for the servant kens‐na what the maister dis: but I hae caʼd ye ‘freends’; for aʼ that I hae heard frae my Faither I hae tellʼt you. “Ye hae‐na made wale oʼ me, but I hae made wale oʼ you, and made ye sterk; sae as ye soud gang and bring forth frute, and frute that sal bide: that aʼ things ye seek frae the Faither iʼ my name, he may gie ye. “Oʼ thir things I gie commaun — that ye loʼe ane anither. “And gin the warld be bitter again me, ye ken it hatit me first, afore you. “Gin ye war oʼ the warldʼs ain, the warld wad loʼe its ain; but — for that ye are‐na oʼ the warld, but waled by me oot oʼ the warld — sae the warld has ill‐wull tʼye. “Keep mind oʼ the word I gied ye, ‘The servant isna aboon the Maister!’ Gin they hae persecutit me, they wull eʼen persecute you; gin they mind my sayin, they wull mind yours. “But aʼ sic things wull they do tʼye for sake oʼ my name, eʼen for that they ken‐na him wha sent me. “And gin I hadna come and spoken to them, this sin hadna lain at their door: but noo they hae nae hap for their sin! “He wha ill‐wulls me, ill‐wulls my Faither as weel. “Gin I hadna dune iʼ their mids sic warks as nae ither man eʼer did, this sin hadna been theirʼs; but noo hae they baith seen and ill‐wulled me and my Faither. “But the word is come to pass whilk is putten doon iʼ their Law, ‘They ill‐wulled me, wantin a cause!’ “But whan the Dear Freenʼ is come — him I send ye frae the Faither, the Spirit oʼ Truth, wha comes frae the Faither — eʼen he sal gie witness oʼ me. “And ye, as weel, sall gie witness; for that ye hae been wiʼ me frae the first.” “Thir things hae I tellʼt ye, that ye soudna stoiter, and be dazed. “Ye sall be putten oot oʼ the Kirk: aye, the time is at haun that gin ony ane sheds yere blude, he wull fancy he sers God! “And aʼ thae things wull they do tʼye, for that they hae naither kent my Faither nor me. “But I hae tellʼt ye thae things, sae whan the time comes, ye sal caʼ to mind I tellʼt ye oʼ them. And thir things I gied‐ye‐na at the first, for I was wʼye. “But noo I gang my gate to him wha sent me; and nane oʼ ye speir at me, ‘Whaur gang ye?’ “But, for that I hae said thir things tʼye yere hearts are fuʼ oʼ dool. “Natheless, I tell ye true; better for you that I gang awa; for till I gang awa, the Dear Freenʼ winna come tʼye; but gin I gang, him wull I send tʼye. “And whan he is come he wull convince the  warld oʼ sin, and oʼ richtness, and oʼ judgment. “Oʼ sin — for they lippen‐na on me. “Oʼ richtness — for I gang to the Faither, and ye see me nae mair. “Oʼ judgment — for this warldʼs Prince is judged. “Mony are the things I hae to say tʼye, but ye canna thole them noo. “But whan he is come, the Spirit oʼ aʼ truth, he wull airt ye intil aʼ the truth: for he speaks‐na oʼ his sel allenarlie; but what he hears he sal speak: and he sal open tʼye things no yet come. “He sal glorify me: for he sal tak oʼ mine, and schaw to you. “Aʼ that the Faither has is mine; and sae said I, ‘He sal tak oʼ mine, and schaw to you.’ “A wee while, and ye see‐me‐na, and than again, a wee while, and ye sal see me — for I gang to the Faither.” Than amang their sels the disciples said, “What isʼt he says to us? ‘A wee while, and ye see‐me‐na; and than a wee while and ye sal see me?’ and, ‘For I gang to the Faither?’ ” Sae they speirʼt. “What isʼt he says, ‘A wee while?’ We canna ken what he says!” Noo Jesus kent they war fain to speir at him; and said to them, “Dʼye seek amang yersels to ken oʼ what I said, ‘A wee while ye see‐me‐na, and than a wee while and ye sal see me?’ “Truly, truly say I tʼye, ye sal greet and maen, but the warld sal be blythe; and ye sal hae dool, but yere dool sal come to be blytheness. “A wumman in her bearin‐pangs has dool, for that her ʼoor is on her; but as sune as she has borne the bairn, she minds nae mair the pang, for blytheness that a man is born intil the warld. “Aʼ ye hae dool and sorrow e‐noo; but I wull be wʼye again, and yere heart sal be blythe; and yere blytheness nane sal tak awa frae ye. “And iʼ that day ye sal need to seek to me for nocht. Truly, truly say I tʼye, onything ye sal seek oʼ my Faither in my name, he wull gie ye. “Till this time hae ye socht for  naething in my name: seek, and ye sal hae; that ye may hae rowth oʼ joy. “Thir things hae I gien ye, as it war, in parables; but the time is at haun that I speak nae mair to ye in parables, but sal schaw ye plainly oʼ the Faither. “Than sal ye seek in my name; and I say‐na I wull pray to the Faither for ye — “For the Faither his ain sel loʼes ye, for that ye hae loʼed me, and hae lippened that I cam oot frae God. “I cam frae the Faither, and am come to the warld; again, I leaʼ the warld, and gang to the Faither.” Quoʼ the disciples to him, “Aye, noo ye speak to us plain, and divna speak to us in parables! “Noo see we weel that ye ken aʼ things, and need‐na ony ane to speir at ye: by this token we ken ye cam forth frae God!” Jesus answerʼt, “Dae ye noo believe? “Tak tent! the ʼoor is at haun — aye, is eʼen noo here — that ye sal be aʼ skailʼt, ilka man awa to his ain, and sal leaʼ me alane: and yet I am neʼer alane, for the Faither is aye wiʼ me. “But thir things hae I said tʼye, that ye micht hae peace. Iʼ the warld ye hae dool and sorrow eneuch; but blythely haud yersels; I hae grippit the warld, and putten it doon.” Sae spak Jesus, and than liftit up his een aboon, and said, “Faither, the ʼoor is here! Glorify thy Son, sae that thy Son soud eʼen glorify thee; “Eʼen as thou hast gien him authoritie ower aʼ leevin, that he micht gie Life‐for‐Aye till as mony as thou hast gien him. “And here is Life‐for‐Aye, that they soud ken thee, wha art the true God aboon, and Jesus the Christ, sent by thee. “Thee hae I glorifyʼt on the yirth; I hae wrocht the wark thou gied me to do. “And noo, O my Faither! glorify me Aboon wiʼ thysel, eʼen wiʼ the glorie I bure wiʼ thee afore aʼ warlds! “I hae schawn forth thy name to the men thou did gie me oot frae the warld: they war thine, and oʼ thine ain thou did gie me: and they hae keepit thy word. “And they hae come to ken that aʼ things thou hast gien me are oʼ thysel. “For I hae gien them the words thou gied me; and they hae taen them ben to them, and stievely ken that I cam forth frae thee; and they hae lippened that thou sent me. “For them I pray; no for the warld, but for them thou giʼest me; for they are thy ain. “And aʼ things mine are thine; and aʼ things thine are mine; and I in them am glorifyʼt! “And now I am nae mair iʼ the warld; I come ben to thee! but thir bide iʼ the warld. Faither aye holie! keep by thy ain nameʼs micht aʼ thou giʼest me, that they may be ane, eʼen as we are ane! “The time I was wiʼ them iʼ the warld, I keepit them iʼ thy name; thae thou gied me I keepit, and nane oʼ them is tint, savin only the son oʼ the pit: that the Scriptur micht be carryʼt oot. “And noo, hame to thee come I! And aʼ thir things I speak iʼ the warld, sae as my joy micht come to pass in them. “Thy word hae I gien them; and the warld has ill‐wulled them, for that they  arena oʼ the worldʼs ain: eʼen as I am‐na oʼ the warldʼs ain. “I pray na they soud be taen oot oʼ the warld, but that thou keep them frae the ill oʼt. “For they are‐na oʼ the warldʼs ain, eʼen as I am‐na oʼ the warldʼs ain. “Consecrate them throwe thy truth; thy word is truth. “As thou did pit me intil the warld, eʼen sae hae I putten them intil the warld. “And for them I consecrate mysel, that eke they soud be consecrate iʼ the truth. “Noo for thir, allenarlie, dae I pray; but eke for them wha sal lippen me throwe their tellin. “That aʼ they may be ane; eʼen as thou, Faither, in me, and I in them, that they may be ane in us; sae as the warld may ken that thou sent me. “And the glorie thou gied me, I hae eʼen gien them; sae as they may indeed be ane, eʼen as we are but ane. “I in them, and thou in me; that they may be perfete in ane; and that aʼ the warld may ken that thou sent me, and has love to them, eʼen as thou hast love to me. “Faither, I wad mair, that they wham thou gies me, soud be wiʼ me whaur I bide; that they may set een on my glorie whilk thou has gien me; for thou loʼed me ʼor the fundation oʼ the yirth. “O Faither oʼ aʼ Richt! the warld hasna kent thee; but I hae kent thee; and thir hae come to ken that thou sent me oot. “And I hae deponed to them thy word, and wull depone; sae as the love — eʼen like sic as thou has for me — may be within them, and I mysel within them.” Thir things bein said, Jesus gaed oot wiʼ his disciples, ower the burn Kedron, whaur was a gairden, intil whilk he enterʼt, wiʼ his disciples. But Judas as weel, wha was betrayin him, kent the place; for Jesus aft forgatherʼt thar wiʼ his disciples. Sae Judas, haʼin a band oʼ men gien to him, wiʼ officers frae mang the Heigh‐priests and Pharisees, comes yonder, wiʼ bowets and wapins. But Jesus, kennin aʼ things that soud come to him, gangs forrit and says to them, “Wham seek ye?” They answerʼt him, “Jesus, the Nazarene.” He says to them, “I am he!” Noo, Judas, wha was betrayin him, stude amang them. Whan, than, he had said to them, “I am he!” they stoiterʼt backlins, and fell to the grun. Than again he speirʼt at them, “Wham seek ye?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” Jesus answerʼt, “I hae tauld ye I am he; gin tharfor ye seek me, lat thir gang their ways.” That the word micht come to pass whilk he said, “Thae thou gied me I hae keepit, and nane oʼ them is tint.” Simon Peter, haʼin than a sword, drew it, and strack the Heigh‐priestʼs servin‐man, and sned aff his richt lug. The servin‐manʼs name was Malchus. Than cryʼt Jesus to Peter, “Sheath the sword! The cup my Faither has gien me, sal I no drink it?” Than the band, and the Captain, and the officers oʼ the Jews, grippit Jesus, and bund him; And cairryʼt him to Annas at first, for he was gude‐faither to Caiaphas, wha was Heigh‐priest that year. Noo it was Caiaphas wha gied coonsel to the Jews, that it was profitable that ane soud dee for the lave oʼ the nation. Noo Simon Peter and the ither disciple war followin Jesus; that disciple was kent oʼ the Heigh‐priest, and gaed in wiʼ Jesus intil the Coort oʼ the Heigh‐priest. But Peter was at the door, oot‐by. Than gaed oot the ither disciple, and spak to the porteress, and brocht in Peter. Than said the maid (the porteress) to Peter, “Are ye, too, oʼ this manʼs disciples?” Quoʼ Peter, “I am no!” And the servin‐men and officers stude thar, haʼin made an ingle wiʼ coals, for it was cauld; and they warmed their sels; and Peter, as weel, was wiʼ them, and stude and warmed his sel. The Heigh‐priest than speirʼt at Jesus, anent his disciples, and anent his teachin. Jesus answerʼt him, “Wiʼ aʼ plainness oʼ speech I spak to the warld. I was aye teachin iʼ the kirk and iʼ the temple, whaur aʼ the folk aye gang; and hidlins I hae said naething. “Why dae ye speir at me? Speir at thae that heard me, what I tellʼt them? They aʼ ken what I said!” And syne whan he had sae said, ane oʼ the officers staunin by, gied Jesus a daud wiʼ his loof, sayin, “Dae ye answer sae the Heigh‐priest?” Jesus answerʼt to him, “Gin I hae said ill, bear ye witness oʼ the ill; but if no, why dae ye clour me?” Noo Annas sent him bunʼ to Caiaphas the Heigh‐priest. But Simon Peter stood warmin his sel. They said to him, “Are‐na ye ane oʼ his disciples?” He denied, sayin, “I am no!” Ane oʼ the Heigh‐priestʼs servants, a freend oʼ him whase lug Peter sned aff, says, “Did I no see ye iʼ the gairden wiʼ him?” Than Peter denied again; and at ance the cock crawʼd. Than took they Jesus frae Caiaphas intil the Judgment‐haʼ; and it was early: and they their sels gaed‐na intil the Judgment‐haʼ, that they soudna be defiled — sae as they could eat the Pasche. Pilate then gaed oot to them, and says, “What dae ye wyte this man wiʼ?” They answerʼt, and quoʼ they, “Gin he war‐na an ill‐doer, we wadna hae  gien him ower to ye.” Than quoʼ Pilate to them, “Ye yersels tak him, and try him conform to yere law.” But quoʼ the Jews to him, “We hae nae pooer to pit ony man to deid!” That Jesusʼ ain sayin micht come to pass whilk he spak, settin forth whatna death he soud dee. Than Pilate gaed intil the Judgment haʼ again, and caʼd Jesus, and quoʼ he to him, “Are ye the King oʼ the Jews?” Jesus answerʼt, “Say ye this oʼ yere ain sel, or did ithers tell ye me?” Quoʼ Pilate, “Am I a Jew? Yere ain folk and the Heigh‐priests hae gien ye up to me: what hae ye dune?” Jesus answerʼt, “My Kingdom isna oʼ this warld: gin my Kingdom was oʼ this warld, my servants wad fecht, that I soudna be gien up to the Jews: but noo is my Kingdom no frae here?” Quoʼ Pilate to him, “Are ye a King, than?” Jesus answerʼt, “Ye weel say I am a King. For this end was I born, and for this end cam I to the warld, to gie witness oʼ the truth. Ilka ane wha is oʼ the Truth hears my voice” Pilate says to him, “What is Truth?” And whan he had sae said he gaed oot again to the Jews, and quoʼ he to them, “I find nae faut in him! “But ye hae a way oʼ haein ane lowsed at ilka Pasche; sae wull ye that I lowse for ye ‘The King oʼ the Jews’?” But they aʼ cryʼt oot again, sayin, “No this man, but Barabbas!” Noo Barabbas was a reiver. Than Pilate took Jesus, and had him scourged. And the sodgers wrocht a croon oot oʼ thorns, to pit on his heid; and they cleedit him in a purple robe. And quoʼ they, “Hail, King oʼ the Jews!” And they daudit him wiʼ their hauns. Sae Pilate gangs forth again, and quoʼ he to them, “Look, I fesh him forth tʼye, sae as ye may ken I find nae faut in him!” Than Jesus cam forth, wearin the croon oʼ thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate cryʼt to them, “Look at the man!” Whan the Heigh‐priests and the officers saw him, they cryʼt oot, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate says to them, “Tak ye him to crucify; for I find nae faut in him!” The Jews answerʼt, “We hae oor ain law, and aneath oor law he soud dee, for that he maks his sel Godʼs Son!” Whan Pilate heard that sayin, he was aʼ the mair fleyʼt. And gaed again intil the Judgment haʼ, and says to Jesus, “Whaur are ye frae?” But Jesus answerʼt‐him‐na. Than quoʼ Pilate to him, “Dae ye no speak tae me? Dae ye no ken I hae pooer to crucify ye, and pooer to lat ye gang?” Jesus answerʼt, “Ye coud hae nae pooer ava again me, gin it warna gien ye frae Aboon: sae he wha deliverʼt me to ye has the chief sin.” And frae that oot, Pilate wad fain lowsed him; but the Jews cryʼt oot, “Gin ye lat this man gang, ye arena Cesarʼs freend; ilka ane that mak oot his sel a king, speaks contrar to Cesar!” When Pilate heard that, he brocht Jesus forth, and sat his sel doon in the Judgment‐seat, in a place caʼd “The Plainstanes,” but iʼ the Hebrew, “Gabbatha.” And it was the preparation‐day oʼ the Pasche, and aboot the  saxt ʼoor oʼ the day; and quoʼ he to the Jews, “Look at yere King!” But they cryʼt oot, “Awa, awa wiʼ him! Crucify him!” Quoʼ Pilate to them, “Wad I crucify yere King?” The Heigh‐priests replyʼt, “We hae nae King but Cesar!” Than he gied him up to them to be crucifyʼt. And they took Jesus, and led him awa. And he, cairryin his cross, gaed forth intil a place caʼd “The Skull,” whilk same is caʼd iʼ the Hebrew, “Golgotha” — Whaur they crucifyʼt him; and wiʼ him ither twa, here and yonder, and Jesus atween. And forby, Pilate wrate a title, and pat it on the cross. Noo thar was putten onʼt, “Jesus the Nazarene, the King oʼ the Jews.” And it was sae that a hantle oʼ the Jews read this title; for the bit whaur Jesus was crucifyʼt was nar‐haun the citie; and it was written iʼ the Hebrew, and eke iʼ the Latin and Greek. Than quoʼ the Heigh‐priests oʼ the Jews to Pilate, “Dinna write ‘King oʼ the Jews,’ but ‘He said, ‘Iʼm King oʼ the Jews!’ ” Pilate answert, “What I hae written, I hae written!” Than the sodgers, whan they had crucifyʼt Jesus, took his cleedin, and made it aʼ intil fowr pairts, to ilka ane, ane — and his inner coat as weel. Noo the inner coat was wantin ony seam; aʼ wrocht in ae piece frae the tap doon. They said ane till anither, “Lat us no rive it, but cast lots forʼt, whase it sal be!” Sae was fulfilled the Scriptur, that said, “They pairtit my garments for theirsels, and on my cleedin cuist they lots.” Thae vera things the sodgers did. But staunin by the cross oʼ Jesus war his mither, and his mitherʼs sister, Mary (she oʼ Cleophas), and Mary oʼ Magdala. Sae whan Jesus saw his mither, and the disciple wham he loʼed staunin by, he says to the mither, “Wumman, see yere son!” Again, he says to the disciple, “See! yere mither!” And frae that ʼoor the disciple took her to his ain hoose. Eftir this, Jesus, kennin that aʼ things war noo endit, that the Scriptur micht be dune, said, “I hae drouth!” A cog was thar, fuʼ oʼ soor wine; and they dippit a sponge inʼt, and pat it on a wand oʼ hyssop, and brocht it to his mouʼ. Whan Jesus had gotten the soor wine, he cryʼt, “It is dune!” and loutin doon his heid, gied up his spirit. Than the Jews — seein it was the Preparation — that the bodies soudna bide on the crosses ower the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), craved Pilate to hae their legs broken, and they be taen doon. Than cam the sodgers; and brak the legs oʼ the first, and oʼ the ither, wha war crucifyʼt wiʼ him. But whan they cam to Jesus, and they coud see he was eʼen noo deid, they brak‐na his legs. But ane oʼ the sodgers, wiʼ a spear, proddit his side, and oot oʼt cam blude  and watir. And he wha beheld it, has gien witness; and his witness is truth; that ye micht believe. For thae things cam aboot that the Scriptur soud be fulfillʼt, “No a bane oʼ his sal be broken!” And ance mair, anither Scriptur, “They sal look on him they hae pierced!” And eftir thir things, Joseph oʼ Arimathea (himsel a disciple oʼ Jesus), craved Pilate that he micht tak awa Jesusʼ body; and Pilate loot him sae dae. Syne he cam, and took awa the corp. And eke cam Nicodemus (he wha at the first cam to him by nicht), bringin a hantle oʼ myrrh and aloes, throwe‐ither; aboot a hunner‐wecht. Sae they took the body oʼ Jesus, and rowʼt it iʼ the linen wiʼ the spices; as is the mainner oʼ the Jews wiʼ the deid. Noo at the bit whaur he was crucifyʼt was a gairden; and iʼ the gairden a new‐made tomb, in whilk man was neʼer yet laid. Thar, than, laid they Jesus, on accoont oʼ the Preparation oʼ the Jews; for the tomb was nar‐by. But on the first day oʼ the week, Mary oʼ Magdala comes earʼ — for it was yet mirk — to the tomb; and she sees the stane taen awa frae the tomb. Than she rins, and gaes to Simon Peter, and to the ither disciple wham Jesus loʼed, and says to them, “They hae taʼen awa my Lord oot oʼ the tomb, and we kenna whaur they hae laid him!” Sae Peter gaed oot, and the ither disciple, to gang to the tomb. And they ran baith thegither; and the ither ane ootran Peter, and cam first to the tomb. And he, loutin doon, saw the linen claiths lyin; but he gaed‐na in. Than Peter comes, eftir him, and gaed intil the tomb, and saw the linen claiths lyin; And the naipkin that was rowʼt aboot his heid, no lyin wiʼ the linen claiths, but rowʼt up in a place by itsel. And than gaed in the ither disciple wha cam first to the tomb; and he saw, and believʼt. For till noo they kent‐na the Scriptur, that he soud rise frae ʼmang the deid. The disciples than gaed awa again to their ain hame. But Mary stood oot‐by, at the tomb, and  greetin; and as she grat, she loutit doon, and peerʼt intil the tomb. And saw twa Angels in white, sittin, ane at the heid, and the tither at the fit, whaur the corp oʼ Jesus had been laid. And they say to her, “Wumman, why greetin sae?” She says to them, “For that they hae taen awa my Lord, and I kenna whaur they hae laid him!” Sayin this, she turned aboot, and saw Jesus staunin, and kent‐na that it was Jesus. Jesus spak to her, “Wumman, why greetin sae? Wham dae ye seek!” She, takin him to be the gairdener, says to him, “Sir, gin ye hae cairryʼt him awa, tell me whaur ye hae laid him, and Iʼll tak him awa.” Jesus says to her, “Mary!” She turned hersel, and cries oot, “Rabboni!” as muckle as to say, “Maister!” Jesus says to her, “Stay‐me‐na! for I am‐na yet gane up to the Faither; but gang ye to my brethren, and tell them, ‘I gang up to my Faither and yere Faither, and to my God and yere God!’ ” Mary Magdalene cam and tellʼt the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said thir things to her. Than, the same day at eʼen — the first day oʼ the week — whan the doors war  steekit whar they war gaitherʼt, for dreid oʼ the Jews, cam Jesus, and stude iʼ the mids, and said to them, “Peace be tʼye!” And whan he had said this, he schawed them his hauns and his side. Than the disciples rejoiced, seein the Lord. Than said Jesus to them again, “Peace be tʼye! As the Faither has sent me, eʼen sae send I you!” And whan he had sae said, he breathed‐oot on them, and says to them, “Receive ye the Holie Spirit! “Whase sins ye forgie, they sal be forgiʼen to them! and whase sins ye retain, they are retained to them.” But Tammas, ane oʼ the Twalʼ, the ane caʼd “The Twin,” wasna wiʼ them whan Jesus cam. The ither disciples than said to him, “We hae seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Gin I see‐na in his hauns the prent oʼ the nails, and gin I pit‐na my fingʼer intil his side, I canna believe!” And eftir an aucht‐days again, his disciples war in, and Tammas wiʼ them, Jesus comes — the doors being steekit — and stude iʼ the mids, and says, “Peace be tʼye!” Than says he to Tammas, “Rax oot yere finger, and see my hauns; and rax here yere haun, and pit it intil my side; and be‐na dootin, but believin!” And Tammas, answerin, said to him, “My Lord! and my God!” Jesus says to him, “Tammas! for that ye hae seen me, ye believe; happy they wha haena seen me, and yet believe!” And mony ither ferlies maist truly did Jesus afore his disciples, whilk arena putten doon iʼ this buik. But thir are putten doon, that ye soud believe that Jesus is the Christ; and believin, ye micht hae life in his name. Eftir thir things, Jesus schawed his sel again to the disciples at the Loch oʼ Tiberias; and he schawed his sel thus; — Thar war thegither Simon Peter, and Tammas, caʼd “The Twin,” and Nathaniel oʼ Galilee‐Cana, and they oʼ Zebedee, and twa ither oʼ the disciples. Simon Peter says to them, “I gang to the fishin!” Quoʼ they to him, “We, too, gang wyʼe!” They gaed oot, and enterʼt intil the boat; and that night they tuik naething. But whan the morn was dawin, Jesus stood on the strand; but his disciples kent‐na that it was Jesus. Than said Jesus to them, “Bairns, hae ye aiblins ocht to eat?” They answerʼt him “Na!” He said to them, “Cast ye the net on the richt side oʼ the boat, and ye sal finʼ!” Sae they cuist, and noo they coudna drawʼt for the rowth oʼ fish. Noo that disciple wham Jesus loʼed says to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As sune as Peter heard it was the Lord, he bund his coat aboot him — for he was strippit — and cuist his sel intil the sea. And the ither disciples cam wiʼ the wee boat (for they warna far frae lanʼ, but some fifty faddoms aff), trailin the net oʼ fish. As sune as they cam to the lanʼ they see an ingle oʼ coals thar, and fish ower it; and breid. Jesus says to them, “Bring some oʼ the fish ye hae noo taʼen!” Simon Peter gaed up, and feshʼt the net to lanʼ, fuʼ oʼ muckle fish, a hunner and fifty‐thrie; and yet for aʼ they war sae mony, the net wasna riven. Jesus says to them, “Come awa and eat!” And no ane oʼ them venturʼt to speir at him, “Wha are ye?” kennin it was the Lord. Jesus comes, and taks the breid, and gies them; and the fish as weel. This is eʼen the third time Jesus shawed his sel to his disciples, eftir he was risen frae the deid. Sae whan they had eaten, Jesus says to Simon Peter, “Simon, son oʼ John! Love ye mair than thir do?” He says to him, “Aye, Lord! thou kens I treasur thee!” He says to him, “Feed my wee lambs!” He says to him again, a second time, “Simon, son oʼ John! Love ye me?” He says to him, “Aye, Lord! thou kens I treasur thee!” He says to him, “Herd my sheep!” He says to him the third time, “Simon, son oʼ John! treasur ye me me?” Peter was wae that he said to him the third time, “Treasur ye me?” And he said to him, “Lord! thou kens aʼ things; thou weel kens I treasur thee?” Jesus says to him, “Feed my puir sheep! “Truly, truly say I tʼye, Whan ye war young, ye girt yersel, and stappit oot whaur ye wad; but whan ye sal be auld, ye sal rax oot yere hauns, and anither sal gird ye, and cairry ye whaur ye wad‐na.” Thus spak he, to signify by whatna  death he soud glorify God. And whan he had said this, he says to him, “Follow ye me!” Peter, turnin aboot, sees the disciple wham Jesus loʼed followin, the ane wha leant again his breist at supper, and said, “Lord! wha isʼt that betrays thee?” Peter, seein him, says to Jesus, “Lord! and this man, what oʼ him?” Jesus says to him, “Gin I wull that he wait till I come, what isʼt to you? Ye follow me!” This sayin than gaed oot amang the brethren, that that disciple wasna to dee. But Jesus said‐na, “He sanna dee!” but “Gin I wull that he wait till I come, what isʼt to you!” This is the disciple that testifies oʼ thir things, and penned thir things, and we ken that his testimonie is true. And mony ither things are thar that Jesus did; sae that gin aiblins they war to be penned every ane, I tak it that eʼen the warld itsel wadna haud the buiks that wad needs be penned. The first historie I made, O Theophilus, anent aʼ that Jesus begude baith to do and to teach, Till whatna day he was taen up, eftir that he had by the Holie Spirit gien commauns to the Apostles he had waled oot; And to wham he schawed his sel leevin eftir his sufferans, by mony sure and certain tokens, appearin to them throwe forty days, and speakin oʼ the things anent the kingdom oʼ God. And companyin wiʼ them, chairged them no to gang awa frae Jerusalem, but to bide for the promise oʼ the Faither, “Whilk,” quoʼ he, “ye hae heard oʼ me. “For in sooth John bapteezʼt wiʼ watir, but ye sal be bapteezʼt in Holie Spirit no mony days frae noo!” And sae they, whan they cam thegither, speirʼt at him, “Lord, do thou at this time bring back the kingdom to Israʼl?” And he said to them, “It isna for you to ken times and seasons, whilk the Faither has keepit in his ain haun. “But ye sal hae strenth, eftir the Holie Spirit is come to ye; and ye sal be witnesses for me baith in Jerusalem, and in aʼ Judea and Samaria, and to the far‐awaʼ ends oʼ the yirth.” And whan he had said thir things, while they war lookin on, he was liftit up; and a clud happit him oot oʼ their sicht. And while they lookit, peerin intil the heevens, as he gaed up, twa men stude by them in white cleedin; Wha said, “Ye men frae Galilee! why staun ye peerin intil the lift? The same Jesus, wha has been taʼen frae you intil Heeven, sal come in like mainner as ye hae seen him gang intil Heeven.” Than to Jerusalem they returned frae the Mount Olivet, whilk is nar‐haun Jerusalem — a Sabbath‐dayʼs journey aff. And whan they enterʼt, they gaed up intil the laft, whaur they bade; baith Peter, and John, and James, and Andro, Philip and Tammas, Bartholomie and Matthew, James (he oʼ Alpheus), and Simon the Zealot, and Judas oʼ James. Thae aʼ bade wiʼ ae mind in prayer; wiʼ certain weemen; and Mary, Jesusʼ mither, and wiʼ his brithers. And iʼ thae days stude Peter up iʼ the mids oʼ the brethren, and said (thar war a hantle oʼ folk thegither — aboot sax score), “Men, brethren! the Scriptur needit to be brocht to pass, whilk the Holie Spirit iʼ Dauvid spak afore, anent Judas, wha airtit thae that grippit Jesus. “For he was countit wiʼ us, and had gien to him a pairt in this service. (“Noo this ane gaitherʼt to him a field oot oʼ the reward oʼ iniquity; and faʼin heidlang, he brak throwe iʼ the mids, and aʼ his inwarts teemed oot. “And it was kent till aʼ the folk oʼ Jerusalem; sae that yon field they caʼd ‘Aceldama,’ or The Field oʼ Blude.) “For it is putten doon iʼ the buik oʼ the Psalms, ‘Lat his dwallin be desolate, and nae man bide tharin; and his overseein lat anither ane tak.’ “Sae, oot oʼ the men wha  hae cuisten in their lot wiʼ us, aʼ the days the Lord Jesus was ower us — gaun in and oot — “Beginnin at the Bapteezin oʼ John, to the day he was taen up frae us, ane oʼ thae bude be a witness wiʼ us oʼ his Risin.” And they pat twa forrit; Joseph, caʼd Barsabas, and wha was forenamed “Justus” — and Matthias. And prayin, they said, “Lord, thou wha kens the hearts oʼ aʼ, lat it be kent whilk ane oʼ thir twa thou dost wale oot, “To tak the place in this service and apostleship, frae whilk Judas gaed agley, that he micht gang to his ain place.” And they gied oot their lots for them; and the faʼ was for Matthias; and he was coontit in ane wiʼ the Eleeven. And whan the day oʼ Pentecost was come aboot, they were aʼ thegither in ae place. And aʼ of a suddent cam the sough oʼ a michty rushin wunʼ, and it filled aʼ the place whaur they sat; And thar was seen amang them like dividit tongues oʼ fire, on ilka ane oʼ them. And they war aʼ fuʼ oʼ the  Holie Spirit, and spak wiʼ ither tongues, as the Spirit gied them words. Noo thar war bidin at Jerusalem gude men oot oʼ aʼ kintries ʼneath the skies. And whan the sough oʼ this gat oot, the thrang cam aʼ thegither, and kent‐na what to think, whan they heard them speak, ilka man in his ain tongue. And they war sair amazed, and ferlied, sayin, “Arena aʼ thae that speak folk oʼ Galilee? “And hoo isʼt we hear ilk in oor ain tongue in whilk we war born? “Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the folk wha bide in Mesapotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, “In Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and frae Lybia aboot Cyrene, and visitors frae Rome, and eke Jews, and proselytes, “Cretans and Arabians — we hear them speakin in oor ain tongues oʼ Godʼs wunner‐warks!” And they war aʼ amazed, and in a swither, sayin ane to anither, “What maun aʼ this be?” But some, jeerin, said, “Thir men hae been made fuʼ wiʼ new wine!” But Peter, staunin up, wiʼ the Eleeven, lift up his voice, and quoʼ he, “Men, Jews! and aʼ ye wha dwall at Jerusalem! be this kent tʼye aʼ: and gie ye hearin to my words! “For thir arena drucken, as ye jalouse, it bein but nine oʼclock. “But this is what was spoken by Joel the prophet: “ ‘And it sal be iʼ the hinnermaist days, says God, I teem oot my Spirit on aʼ flesh; and yere sons and yere dochters sal prophesie, and yere young men sal see visions, and yere auld men sal dream their dreams. “ ‘And eʼen on my servitors and my handmaids iʼ thae days sal I teem oot oʼ my Spirit; and they sal prophesie. “ ‘And I sal gie ferlies iʼ the lift aboon, and tokens iʼ the yirth under; blude and fire‐flauchts, and blindin reek. “ ‘The sun sal turn to mirkness, and the mune to blude, afore the comin oʼ the day oʼ the Lord — the great and notable day! “ ‘And it sal be, that ilka ane wha sal caʼ on the name oʼ the Lord sal be saved!’ “Ye men oʼ Israel! hear thir words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man sutten apairt amang ye by wunner‐warks, and ferlies and tokens, whilk God wrocht by him amang ye; as ye ken yer sels, “Him, bein (iʼ the marked‐oot coonsel and fore‐kennin oʼ God) deliverʼt up, ye by the hauns oʼ lawless anes hae crucifyʼt and slain. “Wham God raised up, lowsin the stounʼs oʼ death; for it coudna be possible he soud be hauden oʼt. “For Dauvid spak anent him: ‘I saw the Lord, aye fornent me; for he is at my richt haun that I soudna trimle: “ ‘Sae was my heart blythe, and my tongue rejoicʼt; aye, and mair, my flesh sal eke bide in hope: “ ‘For thou winna desert my saul iʼ the place oʼ spirits, nor will thou gie thy Holie Ane to see corruption. “ ‘Thou did mak me to ken the paths oʼ life; thou shalt mak me fuʼ oʼ joy iʼ thy presence.’ “Men! Brethren! may I no speak freely tʼye oʼ the patriarch Dauvid, that he, his sel, baith deeʼt and was buryʼt, and his tomb is amang us to this day? “But bein a prophet, and kennin that God had sworn wiʼ an aith to him, that amang his bairns Ane soud sit on his thron; “He, forseein this, spak oʼ the Risin‐Again oʼ Christ; that naither his saul was desertit iʼ the place oʼ spirits, nor his flesh saw corruption. “This Jesus has God raised up; and we are aʼ witnesses oʼt. “Sae, bein by Godʼs richt haun up‐liftit, and winnin frae the Faither the promise oʼ the Holie Spirit, he has shed forth this whilk ye noo see and hear. “For Dauvid ascendit‐na intil the Heevens; but his sel said, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my richt haun, “ ‘Till I mak a fit‐brod oʼ thy faes!’ “Noo than, lat aʼ Israelʼs hoose ken for a certaintie, that God has made him baith Maister and Anointit — this Jesus, wham ye crucifyʼt.” And whan they heard this, they war struck to the heart, and said to Peter and the lave oʼ the Apostles, “Men! Brethren! what are we to do?” And Peter said, “Repent ye, and be bapteezʼt iʼ the name oʼ Jesus Christ — for the pittin‐awaʼ oʼ yere sins; and ye sal win the gift oʼ the Holie Spirit. “For the promise is to you, and your bairns, and to aʼ thae far‐awa; eʼen to as mony as the Lord oor God may caʼ to him.” And wiʼ mony mair words testifyʼt he, sayin, “Deliver yersels frae this thrawart generation!” Than they that welcomed his word till them war bapteezʼt; and that day war addit aboot three thoosand sauls. And they bade steive iʼ the teachinʼ oʼ the Apostles, and in fellowship, in the breckin oʼ breid, and iʼ the prayers. And fear fell on ilka ane; and mony war the wunner‐warks and tokens throwe the Apostles. And aʼ the believin anes war thegither, and had aʼ things throwe‐ither. And they sellʼt their mailins and haddins, and portioned aʼ oot, as ony ane had need. And day by day, bidin aye thegither iʼ the Temple, and breckin breid frae hoose to hoose they did tak their meat wiʼ blythe and aefauld hearts; Laudin God, and haein gude‐wull oʼ aʼ the folk. And the Lord addit daily oʼ the saved. Noo Peter and John war gaun into the Temple for the ʼoor oʼ prayer: thrie oʼclock. And a lameter, feckless frae his mitherʼs womb, was eʼen noo carryʼt; wham they set doon daily at the yett that is caʼd “Bonnie”; to seek awmous frae thae gaun intil the Temple; Wha, seein Peter and John gaun forrit to the Temple, socht frae them an awmous. And Peter, settin his een on him — and sae did John — said to him, “Look ye on us!” But he was mindin them, as lookin for something frae them. Than Peter said, “Siller‐and‐gowd bide‐na wiʼ me; but what I hae gie I tʼye! In the name oʼ Jesus Christ oʼ Nazareth, rise ye, and gang!” And he took him by the richt haun, and strauchtit him up; and strenth com intil his feet and cuit?-?banes. And lowpin up, he stude, and gaed. And he gaed wiʼ them intil the Temple; gangin, and lowpin, and giean praise to God. And aʼ the folk saw him, gangin, and laudin God. And they saw and kent that it was he that sat at the “Bonnie” yett oʼ the Temple; and they war aʼ fuʼ oʼ wunner and misdoot at what had befaun him. And as the lameter that was made hale grippit Peter and John, aʼ the folk panged thegither aboot them in the porch caʼd “Solomonʼs Porch,” unco fuʼ oʼ wunner. And whan Peter saw this, he spak: “Ye men oʼ Israʼl! whaurfor ferlie ye at this man? or glower sae at us as gin by some pooer or holiness oʼ oor ain we had garʼt this man to gang? “The God oʼ Abraʼm, oʼ Isaac, and oʼ Jaucob, the God oʼ oor faithers, has glorifyʼt his Son Jesus; wham ye gied up, and disowned him fornent Pilateʼs face, when he was mindit to assoilzie him. “But ye disowned the Holie and the Richtous, and socht for a favor a murderer to be gien tʼye. “And slew him wha brocht Life! wham God has raised frae the deid; oʼ the whilk we are witnesses. “And by lippenin on his name, has his name garʼt this man to hae strenth, wham ye see and ken: aye, eʼen this lealness that comes by him, has gien this perfete soondness fornent ye aʼ. “And noo, brethren! I wat that throwe want oʼ wit ye did it — as eʼen yere rulers. “But the things that God schawed afore‐haun, throwe the mouʼ oʼ aʼ the prophets, that the Anointit Ane soud dree, has he sae brocht to be. “And noo, repent ye, and turn again, that aʼ yere ill deeds may be scored oot; sae as times oʼ refreshin may come frae afore the face oʼ the Lord! “And that he may send Christ Jesus, wha before was gien tʼye. “Wham the Heeven maun welcome, to the time oʼ restorin oʼ aʼ things, oʼ whilk God has spoken by the mooth oʼ aʼ the holie prophets that hae been sinʼ the warld begude. “For Moses  said, ‘A Prophet sal the Lord God raise up to ye frae mang yere brethren, like me; him sal ye hear, whatsaeʼer he may say tʼye. “ ‘And sae it sal be, that every saul that winna hear that Prophet, sal be cuttit‐aff frae ʼmang the folk.’ “Aye, and aʼ the prophets, frae Samuʼl and aʼ that followʼt, as mony as spak, tellʼt oʼ thir days. “Ye are the bairns oʼ the prophets, and oʼ the covenant that God covenantit wiʼ oor faithers, sayin to Abraʼm, ‘And in yere ain seed sal aʼ the hoosehaulds oʼ the yirth be blessʼd!’ “To you first, God, raisin up his Son, sent him blessin ye, in yere turnin awa, ilk ane oʼ ye, frae yere sins!” And, as they war speakin to the folk, thar cam on them the priests, and the Captain oʼ the Temple, and the Sadducees; Bein sair put‐aboot that they soud be teachin the folk, and preachin throwe Jesus the Risin‐Again frae the deid. And they grippit them, and pat them in ward till the morn; for it was noo the gloamin. But mony oʼ thae that heard the word believed; and the number oʼ the men cam to be aboot fyve thoosand. And, it cam, on the morn, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, Wiʼ Annas the Heigh‐priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and aʼ the lave oʼ the Heigh‐priestʼs kin, war gaitherʼt thegither in Jerusalem. And whan they had putten them iʼ the mids, they speirʼt, “By whatna pooer, or whatna name, hae ye dune this?” Than Peter, fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, answerʼt, “Ye rulers oʼ the nation, and elders! “Gin we be this day taen to task anent the gude deed dune to the feckless man, by whase hauns he is made hale, “Be it kent till ye aʼ, and till aʼ the nation oʼ Israʼl, that iʼ the name oʼ Jesus Christ oʼ Nazareth, that ye crucifyʼt, wham God raised frae the deid, eʼen by him this man stauns afore ye hale. “Here is the stane lichtlied by ye that bigg, and it is made the copin oʼ the corner. “And thar is salvation in nae ither; for thar isna anither name ʼneath the skies gien to men, whaurby we maunʼ be saved.” Noo, whan they saw the boldness oʼ Peter and John, and deteckit that they wantit lear, and war common folk, they ferlied at them; and they took tent that they had been wiʼ Jesus. And seein the man that was made hale staunin wiʼ them, they coud say nae mair again it. But, ordering them oot oʼ the Court, they coonsellʼt amang their sels, Sayin, “What are we to do wiʼ thir men? for indeed that a great wunner‐wark has been dune by them, is noo weel kent to aʼ the folk oʼ Jerusalem; and we canna lichtlie it; “But sae as it spreads abreid nae farʼer amang the folk, let us stricklie chairge them to speak to nae man iʼ this name, frae this oot.” And they caʼd them in, and gied them the sweeping chairge no to speak ava, nor to teach, iʼ the name oʼ Jesus. But Peter and John, answerin said, “Gin it be richt for us to list to you, mair than to God, judge yersels! “For we canna forbear speakin oot the things we hae seen and heard!” And whan they had gien them mair warnin, they loot them gang, no seein hoo they coud punish them, on account oʼ the folk; for aʼ glorifyʼt God for what was dune. For the man on wham this ferlie oʼ healin was wrocht, was mair nor forty year auld. And bein let gang, they cam to their ain folk, and gaed ower aʼ that the Heigh‐priests and the elders had said. And they, whan they heard it, liftit up their voice to God wiʼ ae heart, sayin, “Soveran Ane! thou that did mak the heeven and the yirth, and the sea, and aʼ things in the same, “Wha, by the Holie Spirit, by the mouʼ oʼ Dauvid  thy servant, said, ‘Why raged the nations? and the folk wiʼ their minds fuʼ oʼ feckless things? “ ‘The kings oʼ the yirth stude up, and the rulers forgatherʼt, again the Lord, and again his Anointit Ane.’ “For oʼ a truth they war gaitherʼt in this citie, again thy Holy Ane Jesus, that thou did anoint, baith Herod and Pontius Pilate, wiʼ Gentiles and folk oʼ Israʼl, “To do what thy haun and thy mind had markit‐oot aforehaun to come to pass. “And as to things e‐noo, Lord, look hoo they wad daunton us! and gie to thy servants a bauldness to speak thy word; “Eʼen while thou sal rax oot thy haun to heal; and that tokens and ferlies may be dune iʼ the name oʼ thy Holie Ane, Jesus.” And whan they had prayed, the hoose trimilʼt whaur they war gaitherʼt; and ane‐and‐aʼ oʼ them war fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit; and they spak the word oʼ God wiʼ aʼ bravery. And aʼ the thrang oʼ them wha believed war oʼ ae heart and ae saul; and nae man said ocht oʼ his haddin or his plenishin, was his ain; but they had aʼ things throwe‐ither. And the Apostles, wiʼ great pooer, gae witness oʼ the Risin‐Again oʼ the Lord Jesus; and muckle love was bidin on them. Naither was thar ony amang them that wantit; for as mony as aucht hooses or grund sellʼt them, and brocht the prices oʼ what they sellʼt, And pat them doon afore the Apostlesʼ feet; and a proportion was gien to every ane as ilk ane had want. And Joseph, wha was caʼd Barnabas (that is, the Son oʼ Gude‐Guidin), a Levite, a man oʼ Cyprus, Haein a bit grund, sellʼt it, and brocht the siller, and pat it doon at the Apostleʼs feet. Noo a certain man, Ananias, wiʼ Sapphira his wife, sellʼt a propertie. And keepit some oʼ the siller hidlins, his wife kennin oʼt, and brocht some oʼt, and pat it doon at the Apostlesʼ feet. And Peter said, “Ananias! Whaurfor has Sautan fillʼt yer heart, to play fause to the Holie Spirit, and to keep hidlins some oʼ the siller frae the grund? “Whiles ye had it, wasʼt no yere ain? And whan ye sellʼt it, wasʼt no iʼ yere ain haun? Hoo hae ye imaginʼt thir things in yere heart? for ye didna deal fause‐heartit wiʼ men, but wiʼ God!” And Ananias, hearin thir words, fell doon and deeʼt; and muckle fear fell on aʼ that heard. And the young men raise, and rowʼt him up, and bure him oot, and buryʼt him. And eftir aboot thrie ʼoor, his wife cam in — no kennin ocht that was dune — And Peter speirʼt at her, “Tell me, sellʼt ye the grund for sae and sae?” And she said, “Aye; for sae and sae.” Than said Peter, “Hoo isʼt ye hae coonsellʼt thegither to temp the Spirit oʼ the Lord? See! the feet oʼ them that hae buryʼt yere gudeman are at the door, and sal cairry ye oot!” And she fell juist doon at his feet, and deeʼt; and the young men cam in and faund her deid, and bure her oot, and buryʼt her by her gudeman. And great fear cam on aʼ the Kirk, and on aʼ that heard thir things. And mair: by the hauns oʼ the Apostles war mony tokens and ferlies wrocht amang the folk: and they war aʼ, wiʼ ae mind, in Solomonʼs Porch. But oʼ the lave, thar war nane oʼ them venturin to come in wiʼ them; but the folk aʼ laudit them. And believers mair war addit to the Lord, thrangs baith oʼ men and weemen: Sae muckle, that they eʼen cairryʼt oot the sick folk till the causey, and pat them doon on beds and couches, that (gin nae mair), the shadow oʼ Peter, as he cam by, micht faʼ on a wheen oʼ them! And thar war comin thegither, the vera thrang frae ither cities roond Jerusalem, feshin sick anes, and that war fashed wiʼ unclean spirits; and they war healed ilka ane. Than raise up the Heigh‐priest, and aʼ they that war wiʼ him (they oʼ the sect of the Sadducees), and war fuʼ oʼ anger, And grippit the Apostles, and pat them iʼ the toʼbooth. But the Angel oʼ the Lord, by nicht, cam and unsteekit the doors oʼ the toʼbooth, and feshʼt them oot, and said, “Gang ye, and tak yere staun iʼ the Temple, and tell the folk aʼ the words oʼ this life!” And whan they heard this, they enterʼt iʼ the dawin to the Temple, and spak. But the Heigh‐priest cam, and thae that war wiʼ him, and orderʼt the Cooncil thegither, and aʼ the men oʼ eild oʼ Israʼl, and sent to the toʼbooth to hae them brocht. But the officers that cam faund‐them‐na iʼ the prison, and gaed back again, and tellʼt, And quoʼ they, “The toʼbooth faund we steekit, and aʼ safe; and the keepers staunin at the doors; but whan we had openʼt, we faund nae man within.” And whan the Heigh‐priest and the Temple‐captain, and the boonmaist oʼ the priests, heard thir things, they dootit iʼ their sels aboot them — what aʼ this wad come till? But thar cam ane and tellʼt them, “Look! The men ye pat iʼ the toʼbooth are staunin iʼ the Temple, and teachin the folk!” Than gaed the Captain, wiʼ the officers, and feshʼt them wiʼ aʼ courtesie — for they war fleyʼd oʼ the folk, least they micht hae been staned. And whan they had brocht them, they set them fornent the Heigh‐Cooncil. And the Heigh‐priest speirʼt at them, sayin, “Did we no chairge ye stricklie no to be teachin iʼ this name? And see! ye hae fillʼt aʼ Jerusalem wiʼ yere teachin, and ettle to bring this manʼs blude on us!” Than answerʼt Peter and the Apostles, “It behoves us to mind God, mair nor mind man! “The God oʼ oor faithers raised‐again Jesus, that ye slew, hingin him on a tree! “Him has God upliftit at his richt haun, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to gie repentance to Israʼl, and remission oʼ sins. “And we are his witnesses oʼ thae things; and sae too is the Holie Spirit, that God has gien to them that obey him.” Whan they heard that, they war cut to the heart, and coonsellʼt thegither to kill them. But thar raise ane oʼ the Heigh‐Cooncil, a Pharisee, Gamaliel, a doctor oʼ the Law, hauden in honor oʼ aʼ the folk, and gae orders to pit the men oot for a wee. And quoʼ he to them,  “Men oʼ Israʼl; tak tent to yersels, what ye ettle to do wiʼ thir men! “For langsyne raise Theudas, makin his sel oot to be somebody; aboot whom a hantle oʼ men gaitherʼt, aboot fowr hunder: wha was killʼt; and as mony as war perswadit oʼ him war skailʼt, and cam to nocht. “Eftir him raise Judas oʼ Galilee, iʼ the days oʼ the enrollin; and drew awa muckle folk eftir him: he too perishʼt; and aʼ as mony as followʼt him, war cuisten abreid. “And anent thir things I say, lat bide thir men! for, aiblins gin this coonsel or this wark be oʼ men, it wull faʼ; “But gin aiblins it be oʼ God, ye canna ding it doon; least ye eʼen be fund fechtin again God.” And to him they greeʼd; and, bringin forrit the Apostles, they bade them be cloured, and chairged them no to be speakinʼ iʼ the name oʼ Jesus; and loot them gang. And they gaed oot frae the face oʼ the Heigh‐Cooncil, blythe that they war coontit wordie oʼ dreein ill for Jesusʼ sake. And day‐by‐day iʼ the Temple, and iʼ the hooses, they war aye teachin, and preachin Jesus Christ. Noo, iʼ thae days, thar gat up a murmurin amang the Grecian Jews again the Hebrew anes, aboot the weedows bein owerlookit iʼ the giean‐oot oʼ the daily breid. And the Twalʼ brocht the thrang oʼ the disciples thegither, and quoʼ they, “Itʼs no bonnie that we soud leaʼ the service oʼ the Word oʼ God, and serʼ tables. “Sae, brethren, look ye oot frae ʼmang yersels seeven men oʼ gude name, wyss men, fuʼ oʼ the Spirit, that we may set ower this maitter. “But we wull mainteen oorsels aye in prayer, and iʼ the service oʼ the Word.” And the word was weel thocht oʼ aʼ the thrang; and they named Stephen, ane fuʼ oʼ faith and the Holie Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte frae Antioch. Wham they set fornent the Apostles; and whan they had prayed they set their hauns on them. And the word oʼ God grew uncolie; and the feck oʼ the disciples multiplyʼt in Jerusalem; and an unco thrang oʼ the priests followʼt the faith. And Stephen, fuʼ oʼ love and pooer, wrocht great warks and ferlies amang the folk. But certain anes raise up, oʼ the Synagogue caʼd “Oʼ the Freemen,” baith Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and thae frae Cilicia and Asia, arguin wiʼ Stephen. And they warna fit to staun again the wisdom and the Spirit he spak wiʼ. And they set on men, wha said, “We hae heard him lichtlie Moses, and lichtlie God!” And they made a steer amang the folk, and elders, and scribes, and cam on him, and grippit him, and harlʼt him to the Cooncil, And set up witnesses forsworn, wha said, “This man is aye speakin ill oʼ the Holie Place, and the Law; “For we hae heard him threep that this Jesus oʼ Nazareth sal whammle ower this place, and sal do awa wiʼ the orderin that Moses gied us.” And aʼ that war iʼ the Cooncil, glowerin at him, saw his face eʼen like an Angelʼs face! Than quoʼ the Heigh‐priest, “Are thae things sae?” And he  said, “Men! Brethren and faithers, hear! The God oʼ Glorie schawed his sel to oor faither Abraʼm, whan he was in Mesopotamia, afore he bade in Haran; “And said to him, ‘Come ye oot frae yere ain lanʼ, and frae yere ain kin, and come to sic a lanʼ as I sal airt ye!’ “Than cam he oot oʼ the Chaldeanʼs kintra, and dwalt in Haran; and frae thar, eftir his faither was deid, he cam to this lanʼ, whaur ye noo dwall. “And he gied him nae portion inʼt; no, no sae muckle as to set his fit on; yet he promised he wad gie it him in possession, and to his seed eftir him, whan as yet he hadna a bairn. “And God spak thus — that his seed soud tarry in a fremd lanʼ; and they soud mak them bondmen, and misuse them fowr‐hunner year. “ ‘And the folk that hae them in thrall wull I judge,’ said God; ‘and syne sal they come and serʼ me iʼ this vera place.’ “And he gied him a Covenant oʼ circumceesion; and Abraʼm begat Isaac, and circumceesed him at the auchth day; and Isaac, Jaucob; and Jaucob the twalʼ patriarchs. “And the patriarchs, fuʼ oʼ envie, sellʼt Joseph awa to Egypt; but God was wiʼ him. “And deliverʼt him oot oʼ aʼ his sairs, and gied to him favor and lear afore Pharaoh the king oʼ Egypt; and he made him to be governor ower aʼ Egypt, and ower aʼ his hoose. “Noo thar cam a dearth ower aʼ Egypt and Canaan; and oor faithers faund nae mainteenance. “But whan Jaucob kent thar was corn in Egypt, he sent oot oor faithers ance; “And at the second sending‐oot, Joseph was kent oʼ his brethren; and Josephʼs freends war kent oʼ Pharaoh. “Than sent Joseph, and took to him his faither Jaucob, and aʼ his kin, seeventy‐fyve sauls. “And Jaucob gaed doon to Egypt. And he deeʼt thar, he and oor faithers, “And war carryʼt ower to Shechem, and laid doon iʼ the tomb that Abraʼm bocht wiʼ siller frae the sonʼs oʼ Hamor oʼ Shechem. “But whan the time promised cam nar, the time God gied to Abraʼm, the folk grew to be mony, and war multiplyʼt in Egypt. “Till a new king cam up, wha kent naething oʼ Joseph. “And the same wrocht in a guilefuʼ way wiʼ oor faithers, and misused them, sae that their young bairns soud be cuisten oot, to the end they soud dee. “Iʼ the whilk time Moses was born, and he was bonnie to God; and he was nouriced thrie month iʼ the hoose oʼ his faither. “And whan he was cuisten oot, Pharaohʼs dochter took him, and nouriced him for her ain son. “And Moses was instruckit in aʼ the lear oʼ the Egyptians, and was michty in words and deeds. “And whan he cam to be forty year auld, it cam intil his heart to gang and see his brethren, the sons oʼ Israʼl. “And seein ane oʼ them wranged, he took his pairt, and deliverʼt him that dreed the wrang, and strack doon the Egyptian. “For he thocht his brethren soud hae kent hoo God by his haun wad bring them deliverance: but they understude‐na. “And on the morn he schawed his sel to them as they tulzied thegither, and wad hae putten them at ane again, sayin, ‘Men! ye are brithers; why dae ye do wrang, ane to anither?’ “But the ane that did his neebor wrang, shoved him awaʼ, sayin, ‘Wha made ye a maister or a judge ower us? “ ‘Wad ye kill me, as ye killʼt the Egyptian yestreen?’ “And Moses fled awaʼ at this sayin, and tarryʼt iʼ the land oʼ Midian; whaur he begat twa sons. “And whan forty year had gane ower, thar schawed himsel to him iʼ the wilderness oʼ Mount Sinai an Angel, in a lowin fire, in a buss. “And Moses, lookin on, ferlied uncolie at the  sicht; and as he cam nar to seeʼt, the Lordʼs voice cam to him. “ ‘I am the God oʼ thy faithers, the God oʼ Abraʼm, Isaac and Jaucob.’ Than Moses quaked, and daurna look on. “And the Lord said to him, ‘Lowse the shoon oʼ yere feet, for the place ye staun on is holie grunʼ! “ ‘I hae seen, I hae seen, the ill‐doin to my folk that are in Egypt, and hae heard their maen; and I am comedoon to richt them. And noo coʼway! Iʼll send ye to Egypt!’ “This same Moses, wham they cuist aside, sayin, ‘Wha made ye a maister and a judge?’ the same God sent baith for a maister and a deliverer wiʼ the haun oʼ the Angel that appearʼt to him iʼ the buss. “The same led them oot, eftir he had schawn ferlies and tokens iʼ the land oʼ Egypt, and iʼ the Reid Sea, and iʼ the wilderness forty year. “This is yon Moses, wha said to the children oʼ Israʼl, ‘A Prophet sal the Lord yere God raise up to ye oʼ yere brethren, like to me.’ “This was he wha was wiʼ the Kirk iʼ the wilderness, wiʼ the Angel that spak to him in Mount Sinai, and wiʼ oor faithers; wha had gien to them leevin testimonies to gie to us. “To wham oor faithers wadna gie heed; but cuist him oot frae them, and turned back again, iʼ their hearts, to Egypt, “Saying to Aaron, ‘Mak us gods to gang afore us! As for this Moses, wha brocht us oot oʼ Egyptʼs lanʼ, we kenna what has come oʼ him!’ “And they made a cauf iʼ thae days, and brocht a sacrifeece to the eidol, and joyed iʼ the wark iʼ their ain hauns. “But God turned, and gied them up to worship the host oʼ the sky, as it is putten doon iʼ the prophetʼs book, ‘Did ye offer to me slain beass and sacrifeeces forty year iʼ the wilderness, O hoose oʼ Israʼl? “ ‘And ye liftit the tent oʼ Moloch, and Remphanʼs star, yere god — images that ye made to worship them — and I wull tak ye awa ayont Babylon.’ “Oor faithers had the Tent oʼ Witness iʼ the wilderness, eʼen as he appointit wha spak to Moses, that he soud mak it conform to the pattern he had seen. “Whilk eke oor faithers that followʼt, brocht in wiʼ Joshua, whan they cam intil the possession oʼ the nations, wham God pat oot frae before oor faithersʼ faces to the days oʼ Dauvid. “Wha faund favour fornent Godʼs face, and wad fain provide a dwallin‐place for the God oʼ Jaucob. “But Solomon biggit him a hoose. “But yet the Maist High dwalls‐na in hooses made wiʼ hauns; conform to what the prophet says, — “ ‘The Heevenʼs my thron, and the yirthʼs my fit‐brod; whatna hoose wad ye bigg me, quoʼ the Lord; or whaurʼs the place oʼ my rest? “ ‘Wasʼt‐na my ain haun made aʼ thae things?’ “Stiff‐neckit and thrawn! uncircumceesed in heart and lugs! ye aye hae a plea wiʼ the Holie Spirit! as yere faithers, sae div ye. “Wham oʼ the prophets didna yere faithers persecute? And they killʼt them wha schawed aforehaun oʼ the comin oʼ the Righteous‐Ane, oʼ wham, eʼen noo, ye hae been the betrayers and murderers! “Ye wha had the law by ordinance oʼ Angels, and haena keepit it!” Noo, as they heard thae things, they war stricken to the heart, and they gnashʼt at him wiʼ their teeth. But he, fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, lookit up aye to heaven and saw the glorie oʼ God, and Jesus staunin on Godʼs richt haun! And said, “Look! I see the heevens unsteekit, and the Son oʼ Man staunin on Godʼs richt haun!” But they cryʼt oot wiʼ a lood voice, and happit their lugs, and ran on him aʼ thegither; And cuist him oot oʼ the citie, and staned him; and the witnesses pat doon their claes at the feet oʼ a young man caʼd Saul. And they staned Stephen, beseechin, and sayin, “Lord Jesus! tak ye my spirit!” And he kneelʼd doon, and cryʼt wiʼ a soondin voice, “Lord, set‐na doon to them this sin!” And whan he had sae said, he fell asleep. And Saul was ane wiʼ them, in his death. And thar gat up, that day, an unco persecution again the Kirk‐folk oʼ Jerusalem; and aʼ, except the Apostles, war scattered abreid throwe aʼ the kintra‐side oʼ Judea and Samaria. And godly men bure Stephen awaʼ, and made sair lamentin ower him. But as for Saul, he made waste oʼ the kirk, gangin intil aʼ hooses, and harlin aff men and weemen to prison. Sae they war aʼ scattered abreid; and gaed everygate preachin the Word. And Philip gaed doon to Samaria‐citie, and preached the Word to them. And aʼ the folk wiʼ ae mind gied gude tent to the things Philip spak; seein and hearin aʼ the wunner‐warks he wrocht. For foul spirits, skirlin wiʼ rage and pain, cam oot oʼ a hantle possessʼd anes; and mony wiʼ palsies, and that war lameters, war made hale. And thar was unco joy iʼ that citie. But thar was ane caʼd Simon, wha his sel iʼ that citie carryʼt on witchery, and glamorʼt the folk oʼ Samaria, lettin on that his ain sel was some great ane. And to him they aʼ gied heed, frae the least oʼ them to the heichest, for quoʼ they, “This man is Godʼs great pooer!” And they gied tent to him; for that he had lang glamorʼt them wiʼ witcheries. But whan they lippened to Philip, preachin the Gude‐word oʼ the Kingdom oʼ God, and the name oʼ Jesus Christ, they war bapteezʼt, baith men and weemen. Than Simon his sel believed wiʼ the lave; and, bein bapteezʼd, he marrowed wiʼ Philip, wunneran at the great warks and tokens that war wrocht. Noo, whan the Apostles at Jerusalem heard tell that Samaria had received Godʼs word, they sent to them Peter and John: Wha, whan they cam doon, prayed for them that they micht hae the Holie Spirit. For till this time he hadna faun on ony oʼ them: only they had been bapteezʼt iʼ the name oʼ the Lord Jesus. Than laid they their hauns on them, and they received the Holie Spirit. And whan Simon saw that the Holie Spirit was gien throwe the layin‐on oʼ the Apostlesʼ hauns, he wad hae gien them siller; And quoʼ he, “Gie me as weel this pooer, that on wham I lay hauns, he may hae the Holie Spirit!” But Peter says to him, “Perish yere siller wiʼ yersel! for thinkin to troke for the gift oʼ God wiʼ siller! “Ye hae naither airt nor pairt here; for yere heart isna aefauld afore God! “Sae repent ye oʼ this yere wickedness; and pray God gin aiblins the thocht oʼ yere heart may be forgiʼen tʼye. “For I can see ye are iʼ the bitterness oʼ gall, and the shackles oʼ sin!” Quoʼ Simon, “Pray ye the Lord for me, that nane oʼ thae things ye hae said befaʼ me.” And they, whan they had testifyʼt and gien oot the word oʼ the Lord, gaed back to Jerusalem, preachin the Gude‐word in a hantle oʼ the wee touns oʼ the Samaritans. But an angel oʼ the Lord spak to Philip, “Awa to the South! to the road frae Jerusalem to Gaza; iʼ the desert!” And he raise, and gaed awa; and mark! a man oʼ Ethiop, an officer heigh in authority under Queen Candace oʼ the Ethiopians, the chaumerlain oʼ her treasur, had come till Jerusalem for to worship; And was gaun hame again, and was sittin in his chariot, readin the Prophet Esaiah. Than the Spirit says to Philip, “Gang nar, and join in wiʼ this chariot.” And Philip ran till him, and heard him readin the Prophet Esaiah; and quoʼ he, “Are ye unʼerstaunin what yeʼre readin?” And quoʼ he, “Hoo can I, gin some ane dinna airt me?” And he besocht Philip to sit up beside him. The bit oʼ the Scriptur he was readin was, “He was taen oot as a sheep till the slauchtir; and as a lown lamb afore his shearer, sae was he quate; “In his lowliness justice was denyʼt him; and wha sal speak oʼ his seed? for his life is cuttit aff frae the yirth.” And the officer says to Philip, “I pray ye, wham speaks the Prophet oʼ? oʼ his sel, or oʼ some ither ane?” And Philip openʼt his mouʼ; and beginnin at that same word, declarʼt till him Jesus. And as they gaed on their way, they cam till a certain watir; and the officer says, “See, here is watir! what is to hinner me bein bapteezʼt?” And Philip said, “Gin ye believe wiʼ aʼ yere heart, ye may!” And he answerʼt, “I believe that Jesus Christ is Godʼs Son!” And he orderʼt the chariot to stop, and they gaed doon baith intil the watir, Philip and the officer; and he bapteezʼt him. And whan they cam oot oʼ the watir, the Spirit oʼ the Lord cairryʼt awa Philip, and the officer saw him nae mair; and he gaed on his way blythe and joyfuʼ. But Philip was seen at Azotus; and gaun on, he preached the Gude‐word in aʼ the cities, till he cam to Cesarea. And Saul, yet belchin oot threatenins and blude again the Lordʼs folk, gaed to the Heigh‐priest, And craved frae him letters to Damascus, to the kirks, sae as, gin they faund ony oʼ “The Way,” aither men or weemen, he soud fesh them in thrall to Jerusalem. But, as he gaed on, he cam nar‐by Damascus; and aʼ oʼ a suddaintie, thar lowed aboot him a licht frae the lift, And, faʼin to the yirth, he heard a voice sayin to him, “Saul! Saul! why are ye pursuin me?” And he said, “Wha, my Lord, are ye?” While he answerʼt, “I am Jesus, that ye are pursuin! “But rise ye, and gang ye intil the citie, and it sal be tellʼt ye what ye are to do.” And the men wha war wiʼ him stude speechless, hearin a voice, but seein nae man. And Saul gat him up frae the grund, and whan he opened his een he saw nane; sae, takin him by the haun, they airtit him intil Damascus. And he was  thrie days wantin sicht, and naither did eat nor drink. Noo there was a disciple at Damascus, by name Ananias; and the Lord, in a vision, said to him, “Ananias!” And quoʼ he, “See! here am I, Lord!” And the Lord said to him: “Arise, and gang awa to the street caʼd ‘Straucht,’ and speir in Judasʼ hoose for ane Saul by name — oʼ Tarsus; for ken! he is prayin; “And he has seen in vision ane Ananias comin in, and pittin his hauns on him, that he soud win back his sicht.” But said Ananias, “Lord! by a hantle oʼ folk hear I oʼ this man; and hoo muckle skaith he has dune to thy saunts at Jerusalem. “And iʼ this vera place he has pooer frae the Heigh‐priests to bind aʼ thae that seek thy name.” But the Lord says to him, “Gang yere ways; for a favored vessel is this ane to me, for the bearin oʼ my name afore nations, and kings, and the sons oʼ Israʼl. “For I wull schaw to him what unco things he maun dree for the sake oʼ my name.” And Ananias gaed his ways, and cam intil the hoose: and layin hauns on him, says, “Saul! Brither! The Lord — Jesus, that thou saw on the way heretill — has bid me come, that ye micht hae yere sicht, and be fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit.” And at ance fell frae his een as it war scales; and he gat sicht, and raise, and was bapteezʼt. And whan he had meat, he was revived. Than was Saul a wheen days wiʼ the believers that war at Damascus. And at ance, iʼ the kirks, he proclaimed Jesus, that he was Godʼs Son. But they ferlied that heard him: and quoʼ they, “Isna this the ane that made havoc oʼ them that socht this name in Jerusalem? And cam here, ettlin the same, that he micht tak them in bonds to the Heigh‐priest?” But Saul gatherʼt strenth the mair, and silenced the Jews that dwalt at Damascus, demonstratin that “This Ane is the Messiah!” But, whan mair days war come and gane, the Jews colleagued thegither to slay him. Hoobeit, their colleaguin was made kent to Saul. And they gairdit the ports day and nicht to kill him. Than the disciples took him at nicht, and loutit him doon ower the waʼ in a creel. And whan he was come the lenth oʼ Jerusalem, he ettled to join his selʼ to the disciples; but they war aʼ fleyʼt oʼ him, and jaloused that he was a fause ane. But Barnabas took him, and brocht him to the Apostles, and tellʼt them hoo, gaun his gate, he saw the Lord, and that he spak to him; and hoo Saul had spoken bauldly at Damascus, in Jesusʼ name. And he was ane wiʼ them: gaun in and oot at Jerusalem. And he spak bauldly iʼ the name oʼ the Lord Jesus; and he was haein speech wiʼ the Hellenists, and reasonin wiʼ them; but they war seekin hoo to kill him. The brethren, hoobeit, cam to ken oʼt, aud brocht him doon to Cesarea, and sent him awa till Tarsus. Sae than the Kirk, aʼ throwe Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had rest, and was biggit‐up, and was gaun on iʼ the fear oʼ the Lord; and by the airtin oʼ the Holie Spirit was increased. Noo it cam aboot that Peter, gaun throwe aʼ the assemblies, eke cam doon to the saunts that dwalt at Lydda. And thar he lichtit on a man by name Eneas, wha was bedridden for aucht year; a paralytic. And Peter says to him, “Eneas! Jesus the Christ heals ye! Rise, and mak yere bed!” And he raise at ance. And aʼ that dwalt in Lydda and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord. Noo in Joppa was a wumman, a disciple, Tabitha (caʼd Dorcas, that is “Gazelle”); this ane was fuʼ oʼ gude warks and aumouses that she did. And it cam aboot iʼ thae days that she took ill, and deeʼt. And weshin her, they laid her iʼ the laft. And bein that Lydda was nar‐haun Joppa, the disciples, bein tellʼt that Peter was thar, sent twa men to him, entreatin him to mak nae delay in comin to them. And Peter raise, and gaed wiʼ them; and whan he was come, they led him intil the laft; and thar stude by aʼ the weedows, greetin, and schawin the coats and manteels that Dorcas made, while she was wiʼ them. But Peter pat them aʼ oot, and, faʼin on his knees, prayʼd; and turning roond to the corp, cryʼt “Tabitha! Rise!” And she opened her een; and seein Peter, sut up. And giein her a haun, he raised her up; and cryin in the saunts and weedows, he presentit her leevin. Noo, it cam to be kent aʼ throwe Joppa; and a hantle believed on the Lord. And it cam aboot that he bade a gude wheen days in Joppa, wiʼ ane Simon, a tanner. Thar was a man in Cesarea, caʼd Cornelius, officer in a core caʼd “The Italian.” Devout, and fearin God, wiʼ aʼ his hoose; giean aumous to the folk and prayin to God aye. He saw in plain vision, about thrie oʼclock iʼ the day, an Angel oʼ God comin in to him, and sayin to him, “Cornelius!” Noo he, settin his een on him, and bein unco fleyʼt, said, “What isʼt, my Lord?” And he said to him, “Yere prayers and aumouses are come up to be keepit in mind afore God. “And noo, send aff men to Joppa, and fesh ane Simon, caʼd Peter; “He bides wiʼ ane Simon, a tanner, that has his hoose by the sea.” And whan the Angel that spak to him was gane, he caʼd twa servin‐men, and a godlie sodger, oʼ thae waitin on him; And whan he had tellʼt them aʼ things, he sent them awaʼ to Joppa. Noo, on the morn, as they gaed on their way, and cam nar to the citie, Peter gaed up to the hoose‐tap to pray, aboot the denner‐time. And he grew unco hungʼry, and wad fain eaten a wee; but whiles they war preparin, he fell intil a dwaum; And saw the lift unsteekit, and a kind oʼ veschel comin doon, as a great sheet loutit doon by the fowr corners; In whilk war aʼ the beass and creaturs oʼ the yirth, and birds oʼ the air. And a voice cam to him, “Arise, Peter, kill and eat!” But Peter said, “No sae, Lord! for at nae time did I eat ocht that was common or unclean.” And a voice the second time cam to him, “Whatna things God has made pure, caʼ thou no common!” Noo this was dune thrice, and than the veschel was taen up again intil the lift. But as Peter was in a swither, what aiblins this vision he saw micht mean, see! the men sent by Cornelius, haein speirʼt oot the hoose oʼ Simon, stude fornent the yett, And spak, and speirʼt “gin Simon, caʼd Peter, was enterteened thar?” And while Peter considerʼt the vision, the Spirit said to him, “See! thrie meen seek ye. “Arisin, gang doon, and gae wiʼ them, haein nae fears; for I hae sent them.” Than Peter, gaun doon to the men, said, “Tak tent! I am he that ye are seekin; what is the cause oʼ yere comin?” And they said, “Cornelius, an officer, a gude man, and fearin God, well‐thocht oʼ by aʼ the folk oʼ the Jews, was tellʼt by a Holie Angel, to send for ye to his hoose, and to hear words frae ye.” Bringing them in than, he enterteened them. And on the morn he gaed awaʼ wiʼ them; and a wheen oʼ the brethren frae Joppa gaed wiʼ him. And the day eftir he cam intil Cesarea. Noo Cornelius was lookin for them, and had brocht thegither his kin and bosom‐freends. And it cam aboot, that as Cornelius met him, he loutit doon at his feet, and did reverence to him. But Peter raised him, sayin, “Staun up! for I, too, mysel, am but a man!” And sae, talkin wiʼ him, he gaed in; and faund mony that had come thegither. And said to them, “Ye weel ken hoo it isna an allooed thing for a man — a Jew — to join himself, or come to ane oʼ anither nation; and God has schawn me that Iʼse to caʼ nae man common or unclean. “And sae, wiʼ nae argle‐barglin, I cam whan I was sent for; I ask, than, for why ye sent for me?” And Cornelius said, “Fowr days syne, I was praying at the thrie‐oʼclock in my hoose ; and behauld! a man stude afore me in bricht cleedin, “And said, ‘Cornelius! yere prayer is heard ; and yere aumouses are keepit in mind oʼ God. “ ‘Send than to Joppa, and caʼ hither Simon, caʼd Peter; bidin iʼ the hoose oʼ ane Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’ “And sae at ance I sent for ye; and eke ye did weel to come. Noo than, we are aʼ here iʼ the sicht oʼ God, to hear aʼ the things that God has gien ye for us.” And Peter begude to speak, and said, “I see that God is nae chooser oʼ faces: “But amang aʼ nations, he that fears him, and dis richt, is acceptable to him. “As to the word he sent oot to the sons oʼ Israʼl, proclaimin the Gude‐word oʼ peace throwe Jesus the Christ (the same is Lord oʼ aʼ!). “Ye ken what already has taen place, throwe the hail oʼ Judea, beginnin frae Galilee, eftir the bapteezin that John preached, “Eʼen aboot Jesus oʼ Nazareth; hoo God anointit him wiʼ Holie Spirit and pooer; wha gaed aboot doin gude, and healin aʼ that war in thrall to Sautan; for God was wiʼ him. “And we are ee‐witnesses oʼ aʼ things he did, baith iʼ the land oʼ the Jews, and at Jerusalem: wham they slew, hingin him on a tree. “Him did God raise on the third day, and gied him to be seen — “No to aʼ the folk, but to ee‐witnesses waled oot afore by God; by us, wha did in fact eat and drink wiʼ him eftir his risin frae amang the deid. “And he chairged us to preach to aʼ folk, and to testifie that this is he wha was ordeenʼd by God, as the Judge oʼ the leevin and the deid! “To him gie aʼ the prophets witness, that throwe his name ilka ane wha lippens him obteens remission oʼ sins.” While as Peter was yet speakin thir words, the Holie Spirit fell on aʼ that war hearin the word. And the believin anes oʼ the circumceesion war astoundit — they that cam wiʼ Peter — than eʼen to fremd‐folk the free gift oʼ the Holie Spirit was gien. For they listened to him speakin wiʼ ither tongues, and laudin God. Than said Peter, “Can onyane, noo, forbid the watir, that thir soudna be bapteezʼt, wha hae had the Holie Spirit gien them, eʼen as we?” And he orderʼt that they soud be bapteezʼt. Than entreatit they him to bide some wheen days. Noo the Apostles and brethren — they that war in Judea — heard tell that eʼen the Gentiles received the word oʼ God. And when Peter gaed up to Jerusalem, they oot oʼ the circumceesion war  challengin him, Sayin, “Ye gaed in to men no circumceesʼt, and did eat meat wiʼ them!” But Peter, beginnin, set the maitter in order afore them, sayin, “I was in the citie oʼ Joppa, prayin; and in a dwaum I saw a vision — a veschel comin doon, as it had been a great sheet, by fowr corners loutit doon frae the lift: and it cam to me. “Intil whilk narrowlie lookin, I took tent, and saw fowr‐fittit beass oʼ the yirth, and wild beass, and crawlin things, and birdies oʼ the lift. “Forby I heard a voice sayin to me, ‘Arise, Peter, kill and eat!’ “But I answerʼt, ‘No sae, Lord! for naething common nor unclean at ony time has gane intil my mooth!’ “But the voice spak the second time frae aboon, ‘Whatna things God has made pure, caʼ thou no common!’ “Noo this was dune thrice; and it was aʼ taen up again aboon. “And tak tent! eʼen than war thrie men haltin at the hoose whaur I was — sent frae Cesarea to me. “And the spirit bade me gang wiʼ them, switherin nane. And thar gaed wiʼ me thir sax brethren as weel; and we enterʼt intil the manʼs hoose. “And he tellʼt us hoo he saw the Angel in his hoose, staunin and sayin to him, ‘Send awa to Joppa, and fesh Simon, caʼd Peter, “ ‘Wha sal speak words tʼye, in whilk ye sal be saved — ye and yere hoose.’ “And whan I begude to speak, the Holie Spirit fell on them, as on us at the first. “Than brocht I to mind the words oʼ the Lord — hoo he wad say, ‘John bapteezʼt indeed, wiʼ watir; but ye sal be bapteezʼt wiʼ Holie Spirit.’ “And forasmuckle as God gied them the like free gift eʼen as to us wha believed iʼ the Lord Jesus Christ, wha was I that I soud be able to hinner God?” And whan they heard thae things they war quate, and laudit God; sayin, “Noo has God gien repentance until life, eʼen to the Gentiles!” Noo they that war scatterʼt abreid by the persecution that raise anent Stephen, gaed the length oʼ Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch; speakin the word allenar to the Jews. But thar war a wheen men oʼ them — Cyprians and Cyrenians — wha, gaun intil Antioch, spak eʼen to the Greeks; giean them the Blythe‐message pertainin to the Lord Jesus. And the Lordʼs haun was wiʼ them; and an unco hantle oʼ them believin, turned them to the Lord. And the sough oʼ aʼ this cam to the lug oʼ the Kirk at Jerusalem; and they sent oot Barnabas, that he soud gang the lenth oʼ Antioch. Wha comin, and seein hoo gracious was God, rejoicʼt; and besocht aʼ, that wiʼ their hail heart they soud wait upon God. For he was a godlie man, and fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit and faith. And a hantle oʼ folk war won for the Lord. And he gaed on to Tarsus, for to seek Saul; And, lichtin on him, he feshʼt him to Antioch: and it cam aboot, that they met wiʼ the Kirk, and instruckit mony; and the believers, first in Antioch, war named “Christians.” And iʼ thae days, thar cam prophets doon frae Jerusalem to Antioch; And ane oʼ them, caʼd Agabus, gied an intimation, throwe the Spirit, that an unco famine was to come on the hail warld: whilk aʼ cam aboot under Claudius. Than the disciples, ilka ane as he had ability, was mindit to send charitie to the brethren dwallin in Judea. Whilk thing they did, sendin to the Elders, throwe the hauns oʼ Barnabas and Saul. Noo, it was thar‐aboot, that Herod the King raxʼt oot his hauns to do ill to some oʼ the Kirk. And he slew James, Johnʼs brither, wiʼ the sword. And seein it flatterʼt the Jews, he gaed on mair, and grippit Peter as weel (thae war the days oʼ the Sad Breid). And whan he had grippit him, he laid him in thrall; giean him ower to fowr fowrsome sets oʼ sodgers, to keep him; ettlin, eftir the Pasche, to fesh him oot to the people. Sae Peter was keepit iʼ the dungeon; but earnest prayer was made aʼ the time to God for him. And whan Herod wad hae feshʼt him oot, at nicht Peter was sleepin atween twa sodgers, fast wiʼ twa chains; and gairds afore the door tentit the prison. And see! an Angel oʼ the Lord stude by him, and a licht glintit iʼ the dungeon; and giean Peter a dunt on the side, he raised him up, sayin, “Rise up! Haste!” and the chains slypit aff frae his hauns. And the Angel said, “Mak yersel snod, and tie on yere shoon!” And he did sae. And he says to him, “Cast yere manteel aboot ye, and follow me.” And, gaun oot, he followʼt; and kent‐na it was true what the Angel did, but thocht he dreamed a dream. And gaun throwe a first ward, and than a second, they cam to the airn yett that led oot to the citie; whilk unsteekit oʼ its ain sel to them; and gaun oot, they gaed on throwe ae street; and the Angel left him. And Peter, comin to his sel, said, “Noo ken I oʼ a certaintie, that the Lord sent oot his Angel, and deliverʼt me frae Herodʼs haun, and frae aʼ the expectation oʼ the Jewish folk.” And thinkin a wee, he cam to the hoose oʼ Mary, Johnʼs mither — the ane caʼd Mark; whaur mony war forgatherʼt, and prayin. Noo as he chappit at the door oʼ the porch, thar cam oot a lass to hearken, named Rhoda. And, kennin Peterʼs voice, for joy she unsteekit‐na the yett, but rinnin in, she tellʼt “that Peter was staunin fornent the yett.” But  they said to her, “Ye are wud!” But she, on her side, threepit that it was even sae! But they said, “It is his wraith!” But Peter, aʼ this time, was chappin; and openin, they war astonishʼt. But, motionin to them wiʼ the haun to be whishʼt, he tellʼt them aʼ hoo the Lord had led him frae the prison; and said as weel, “Tell thir things to  James and the brethren!” And, gaun on, he cam intil anither place. Noo whan it was day, thar was an unco steer amang the sodgers, “What has become oʼ Peter?” And whan Herod had socht for him, and faund him no, pittin the keepers to the test, orderʼt them to be putten to deid; and gaun doon frae Judea intil Cesarea, he bade thar. Noo he was unco vexed wiʼ the folk oʼ Tyre and Sidon; but wiʼ ae mind they war comin to him; and, makin a freend oʼ Blastus the kingʼs chaumerlain, they socht for peace, for that their pairts were mainteened by the kingʼs kintra. And, on a day appointit, Herod, buskit in royal robes, and sittin on a thron, made a set speech tae them. And the folk made a shout, cryin, “A godʼs voice, and no a manʼs voice!” And at ance the Angel oʼ the Lord dang him, for that he gied‐na God the glorie; and he was devoorʼt oʼ worms, and deeʼt. But the word oʼ God grew mair and mair. And Barnabas and Saul cam back frae Jerusalem, whan they had dune their message; takinʼ wiʼ them John, caʼd Mark. Noo thar war iʼ the assembly at Antioch, baith prophets and teachers; sic like as Barnabas, and Simon (him caʼd Niger), Lucius oʼ Cyrene, and Manaen, wha was foster‐brither to Herod, the king‐depute, and Saul. And, as they serʼt the Lord, and war fastin, the Holie Spirit said, “Set apairt to me Barnabas and Saul, for the wark to whilk I hae bidden them.” Sae, fastin and prayin, and layin their hauns on them, they sent them aff. They, thus sent oot by the Holie Spirit, gaed doon to Selucia; and frae thar sailed the lenth oʼ Cyprus. And, gaun forrit to Salamis, they proclaimed the word oʼ God iʼ the kirks oʼ the Jews; and they had John to attend them. And gaun throwe the hail Isle the lenth oʼ Paphos, they cam on a particular man, a magician, a fause‐prophet, a Jew, by name Bar‐jesus. Wha was wiʼ the governor‐depute, Sergius Paulus, a man oʼ discernment. He, caʼin for Barnabas and Saul, desirʼt to hear the word oʼ God. But Elymas the magician (for sae is translatit his name), withstude them, seekin to turn the governor‐depute frae the faith. But Saul — wha cam to be caʼd Paul, as weel — fuʼ oʼ the Holie Spirit, lookin sternly at him, says, “O fuʼ oʼ aʼ guile and aʼ wrang — son oʼ the Enemy — wull ye no haud frae makin gleyʼd the straucht ways oʼ the Lord? “And noo, see! the Lordʼs haun is on ye! And yeʼse be blinʼ, no seein the sun till the time come!” And at ance thar fell on him a misty mirkness; and, gaun aboot, he was seekin for some ane to airt him by the haun. Than the governor‐depute, seeing what had come about, believed; being made to ferlie at the word oʼ the Lord. Noo, settin their sails frae Paphos, Paulʼs company cam to Perga oʼ Pamphylia. But John, leaʼin them, gaʼed back to Jerusalem. Hoobeit they, leaʼin Perga, cam till Antioch in Pisidia; and gaun intil the kirk on the Sabbath‐day, sat doon. And, the law being read — and the prophets — the kirk‐rulers sent to them, and quoʼ they, “Men, brethren! gin ye hae ony word oʼ gude‐coonsel for the folk, say on!” And Paul, staunin up, and motioning wiʼ his haun, said, “Men, wha are Israʼlites, and ye that fear God, hearken! “The God oʼ this nation Israʼl, waled oot oor forbears, and raised up the folk whan they bade in Egyptʼs lanʼ; and wiʼ a lofty airm he led them oot oʼt. “And for aboot forty yearsʼ time tholed he their behavior iʼ the wilderness. “And, castin doon seeven nations in Canaanʼs lanʼ, garʼt them inherit their lanʼ, for aboot fowr hunner and fifty year. “And eftir thae things, gied he them Judges, till Samuel,  a prophet. “And eftir they socht for a king, and God gied them Saul, son oʼ Kish, a man oʼ Benjaminʼs tribe, for forty years. “And whan he had putten him aside, he raised up Dauvid for their king. Oʼ him, he said, bearin witness, ‘I faund Dauvid, oʼ Jesse, a man eftir my ain heart, wha sal do aʼ my wull.’ “Oʼ this manʼs seed, has God, conform to his own promise, brocht to Israʼl, a Saviour, Jesus. “John haein preached afore his comin the bapteezinʼ oʼ Repentance, to aʼ Israʼlʼs folk; “And as John performed his task, he said, ‘Wha tak ye me to be? I am‐na he! But, tent ye! ane is comin eftir me, the shoon oʼ whase feet I am‐na fit to lowse!’ “Men! brethren! bairns oʼ Abraʼmʼs race! and whasae amang ye fears God! to you the word oʼ this salvation is sent out! “For they oʼ Jerusalem, and their rulers, kennin naither him nor the words oʼ the prophets that are read ilka Sabbath‐day, they hae eʼen fulfillʼt them in condemnin him. “And eʼen though they faund nae cause oʼ death in him, yet demandit they oʼ Pilate that he soud be slain. “And whan they had finishʼt aʼ things anent him whilk had been putten doon, they took him doon frae the tree, and laid him in a tomb. “But God waukened him frae ʼmang the deid. “And he was seen for a gey wheen days, to thae wha cam up wiʼ him frae Galilee to Jerusalem; wha, at this present, are his ee‐witnesses to the people. “And to you we are giean the Blythe‐message, as to the promise made to the faithers, “That God has fulfillʼt the same to our bairns, by raisin up Jesus; as it is putten doon iʼ the first  Psalm, ‘My Son art thou! This day hae I begotten Thee!’ “And, in that he raised him frae ʼmang the deid, noo nae mair to faʼ back to corruption, he thus says, ‘I wull gie you the faithfuʼ lovin‐kindnesses oʼ Dauvid!’ “Sae as in anither place he says, ‘Thou winna gie thy Holy Ane to see corruption!’ “For Dauvid his sel, eftir he had serʼd God in his ain life‐time, fell sleepin, and was laid wiʼ his faithers, and saw corruption: “But he that God waukened up saw corruption nane! “Sae be it kent to you, men! brethren! that throwe this man is proclaimed to you the lowsinʼ oʼ sin! “And throwe himʼ, aʼ wha believe are justifyʼt frae aʼ things, no possible by Mosesʼ law to be justifyʼt frae. “Tak tent, than! sae that come‐na on ye spoken oʼ in the prophets: “ ‘Tak tent, ye that geck! and ferlie ye, and dwine awa! For I work a wark iʼ your days, a wark yeʼse no believe though ane set it plain afore ye!’ ” And whan they skailʼt frae the kirk, they desirʼt that thir words soud be tellʼt them the neist Sabbath. Noo, whan the kirk brak up, thar followʼt mony oʼ the Jews, and oʼ the godlie seekers, wiʼ Paul and Barnabas; wha, speakin till them, heartit them up to continue in Godʼs love. But on the comin Sabbath, nar‐haun the hail citie cam thegither to hear the word oʼ the Lord. But the Jews, seein the thrangs, war fuʼ oʼ jealousie, and spak again thae things that Paul said, miscaʼinʼ them. And Paul and Barnabas, wiʼ great freedom oʼ speech, said, “It was necessar that the word oʼ God soud first be spoken to you: seein ye hae cuisten it frae ye, and adjudge yersels no wordie oʼ eternal life — than, turn we to the Gentiles! “For sae has the Lord bidden us: ‘I hae set thee up for a licht to the Gentiles, that thou may be for salvation to the far‐awa ends oʼ the yirth!’ ” And as the Gentiles heard this, they war pleased, and glorifyʼt the word oʼ the Lord; and as mony as had come to be disposed to eternal life, believed. And the word oʼ the Lord was spread abreid in aʼ that kintra‐side. But the Jews steered up the godlie weemen oʼ gude‐standin, and the heid men oʼ the citie, and raised up a feud again Paul and Barnabas, and cuist them oot oʼ their borders. But they, flaffing the stoor aff their shoon again them, cam to Iconium. And the disciples war filled wiʼ joy and wiʼ the Holie Spirit. Noo, it cam aboot in Iconium, that they gaed intil the Jewsʼ kirk, and sae spak, that thar believed — baith oʼ Jews and Greeks — an unco thrang. But the misbelievin Jews steered up and misleared the sauls oʼ the Gentiles, and garʼt them be turned again the brethren. Sae, a gey while they bade, speakin oot freely iʼ the Lord, wha bure witness to the word oʼ his love, grantin tokens and ferlies to be dune by their hauns. But the bouk oʼ the citie was dividit; and some war wiʼ the Jews, and some wiʼ the Apostles. And whan thar was an onset, baith oʼ the Gentiles and Jews, wiʼ the rulers, to dishonor them and stane them, They kent oʼt, and fled oot‐by intil the cities oʼ Lycaonia, to Lystra and Derbe, and the kintra thar‐aboot. And thar they proclaimed the Joyfu‐message. And at Lystra, thar was sittin a man, feckless in his feet, a lameter frae his mitherʼs womb, wha never gaed. The same man heard Paul speak; wha, strickly observin him, and perceivin that he had faith to be saved, Cryʼt oot wiʼ a soondin voice, “Staun ye up on yere feet!” And he lap up, and walkit aboot. And whan the thrang saw what Paul had done, they cryʼt oot iʼ the tongue oʼ Lycaonia, “The gods, appearin like men, hae come doon to us!” And they war caʼin Barnabas, “Jupiter”; but Paul, “Mercurie,” seein he was the main speaker. And the priest oʼ Jupiter, whase shrine was fornent the citie, brocht owsen and garlands tae the ports, along wiʼ aʼ the thrang, and wad hae dune sacrifeece. But, hearin oʼt, the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, rivin their manteels, ran forrit amang the folk, cryin oot, And sayin, “Men! why are ye doin sic things? We are but men, oʼ like natur wiʼ you; deliverin to ye the Joyfuʼ‐message, that ye soud turn awa frae sic witless things, to the leevin God, wha made heeven and yirth, and the sea, and aʼ things in them. “Wha, in bygane time hindered‐na the nations to gang their ain gate; “Though he left‐na his sel wantin testimonie — doin gude frae aboon, giean us rain and frutefuʼ seasons; fillin fuʼ oʼ joy yere hearts.” And eʼen wiʼ thir sayins, jimply restrained they the thrang, that they soudna sacrifeece to them. But thar cam Jews frae Antioch and Iconium; and, perswadin the thrang, and  stanin Paul, they harled him oot‐by frae the citie; judgin him to be deid. The disciples stanin roon, hoobeit, he, risin up, cam intil the citie; and neist day gaed forth wiʼ Barnabas to Derbe. Deliverin the Blythe‐message to that citie as weel; and, makin mony disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium, and to Antioch. Makin steive the sauls oʼ the disciples, entreatin them to bide iʼ the faith; sayin, “Throwe a hantle oʼ afflictions maun we win to the Kingdom oʼ God.” And, appointin for them elders in ilka assembly, and wiʼ prayer and fastin — they gied them ower to the Lord in wham they pat their trust. And gaun throwe Pisidia, they cam intil Pamphylia; And, proclaimin the word in Perga, they cam doon the lenth oʼ Attalia; And frae that they sailed for Antioch, frae whaur they had been gien ower to the favor oʼ God for the wark they performed. Sae, haein come, they convened thegither the assembly, and gaed ower aʼ things that God did wiʼ them; and hoo that he had unsteekit a door oʼ faith for the Gentiles. And they bade a gey while wiʼ the disciples. And some, comin frae Judea, war instructin the brethren, “Gin ye be‐na circumceesed, conform to Mosesʼ law, ye canna be savʼd!” But eftir thar was nae smaʼ disputin and quaistenin wiʼ them, by Paul and Barnabas, they settled for Paul and Barnabas, and ithers frae amang them, to gang up to the Apostles and Elders, at Jerusalem, anent this quaisten. Sae they, bein set forrit by the Kirk, and gaun throwe baith Phenicia and Samaria, declared the turnin‐aboot oʼ the Gentiles; and garʼt the brethren hae great joy. And, comin to Jerusalem, they war welcomed by the Kirk, and the Apostles, and the Elders; and gaed ower aʼ the things God had dune by them. But thar stude forrit some oʼ the sect oʼ the Pharisees, wha believed, threepin: “It is necessar to circumceese them, and chairge them to keep Mosesʼ law!” And the Apostles and Elders war gotten thegither to consider this maitter. But eftir a hantle oʼ quaistenin, Peter, staunin up, says to them: “Men! brethren! Ye aʼ ken weel, that, a gey while syne, God made wale amang us, that the Gentiles frae my mooth soud hear the Blythe‐message, and believe. “And God — wha taks tent oʼ the heart — bure testimonie; giean them the Holie Spirit, eʼen as to us: “And made nae differ ava atwixt us and them; purifyin their hearts by faith. “And noo, hoo are ye tempin God? wiʼ layin a yoke on the disciples that naither oor faithers nor we war steive eneuch to cairry. “But still we hae faith, throwe the Lord Jesus Christ, that weʼse be saved; eʼen in like mainner as they.” And aʼ the folk keepit whushʼt; and they hearkened to Paul and Barnabas, narratin aʼ the tokens and wunner‐warks God did amang the Gentiles by them. But eftir they had dune, James answerʼt, sayin, “Men! brethren! hearken to me! “Simon has narrated hoo God at first did come to wale oot oʼ the Gentiles a folk for his name. “And to this is conform the words oʼ the prophet, eʼen as it is putten doon: “ ‘Eftir thir things wull I return, and heize up again the tent oʼ Dauvid that is faun doon; and its ruins wull I raise and set up again. “ ‘That the lave oʼ men may seek eftir the Lord; eʼen aʼ the Gentiles on wham has been invoked my name, “ ‘Says the Lord, wha maks aʼ thir things kent frae the beginnin oʼ the warld.’ “Sae my judgment is, that we soudna fash thae wha ʼmang the Gentiles are turnin to God; “But that we soud send letters to them that they keep awa frae the pollutions oʼ eidols, and frae lecherie, and frae things stranglʼt, and frae blude. “For Moses,  oʼ auld time, citie by citie, has thae proclaimin him, being read iʼ the kirks ilka Sabbath‐day.” Than seemed it to be weel to the Apostles and the Elders, wiʼ the hail Kirk, to send waled oot men frae ʼmang them to Antioch, wiʼ Paul and Barnabas; Judas, caʼd Barsabas, and Silas; foremaist men amang the breithren. And wrate by tham: “The Apostles and the elder brethren, to the brethren throwe Antioch and Syria, and Cilicia, that are frae oot the Gentiles — greetin! “Forasmuckle as we hear that some gaun oot frae us, hae putten‐ye‐aboot wiʼ teachin, unsettlin yer sauls; to wham we gied nae sic instructions; “It seems gude to us assembled, bein oʼ ae mind, that, walin oot men, we soud send them to ye, wiʼ oor weel‐loʼed Barnabas and Paul. “Men wha hae putten their lives in pawn for the name oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ. “We hae sent, than, Judas and Silas, and them, that by word oʼ mooth they may report the same things. “For it seemed weel to the Holie Spirit and to us, no to be layin ony mair burden on ye, save thir necessar things: “To keep awa frae eidol sacrifeeces, and frae blude, and frae things stranglʼt, and frae lecherie: oot oʼ whilk keepin yersels clear, ye sal do weel. Fare‐ye‐weel!” Sae they, bein sent awa, gaed doon to Antioch; and, gaitherin the thrang thegither, deliverʼt the letter. And they, readin it, rejoiced ower the consolation. And Judas and Silas, theirsels bein prophets, wiʼ mony words comfortit and upbiggit the brethren. And eftir makin a delay, they war sent awa in peace frae the brethren to them wha sent them oot. Nane‐the‐less,  it pleased Silas to bide still thar. But Paul and Barnabas bade in Antioch, teachin and proclaimin the Blythe‐message oʼ the word oʼ the Lord; wiʼ mony ithers. But eftir a gey wheen days, Paul says to Barnabas, “Lat us turn again, and look in on the brethren, in ilka city whaur we proclaimed the word oʼ the Lord; and see hoo they fare!” Noo Barnabas was minʼt to tak wiʼ them John, wha was caʼd “Mark.” Whauras Paul thocht best no to tak him wiʼ them wha turned awa frae Pamphylia, and gaed‐na wiʼ them to the wark. And thar raise a shairp contention  atwixt them, sae that they sindered the ane frae the ither; and Barnabas, takin wiʼ him Mark, sailed oot for Cyprus. But Paul, walin Silas, gaed oot, being putten ower intil the Lordʼs favor by the brethren. And he gaed throwe Syria and Cilicia, strenthenin the kirks. And he cam intil Derbe and Lystra, and behauld! a particular disciple was thar, named Timothy, son oʼ a believin Jewess, but oʼ a Greek faither; Wha was weel‐spoken oʼ by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium. This ane Paul wad hae to gang oot wiʼ him. And he took and circumceesed him, on accoont oʼ the Jews iʼ thae pairts — for they aʼ kent that his faither was a Greek. And as they gaed throwe the cities, they deliverʼt intil their keepin the word that had been gien oot by the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem. Sae war the assemblies made strang iʼ the faith, and increased in numbers day by day. And they gaed by the Phrygian and Galatian kintra, haein been forbidden by the Holie Spirit to proclaim the word iʼ the Province oʼ Asia; And comin alang Mysia, they ettled to gang intil Bythinia; but the Spirit oʼ Jesus didna alloo them: And, gaun by Mysia, they cam doon to the Troad. And a vision appearʼt to Paul iʼ the nicht: thar stude a Macedonia‐man, and entreatit him, sayin, “Come ye ower intil Macedonia, and bring us help!” Noo, seein the vision, at ance we socht to gang oot intil Macedonia; concludin that God had bidden us proclaim the Blythe‐message to them. Settin sail, than, frae the Troad, we held straucht to Samothracia; and on the morn to Neapolis; And frae thar to Philippi, whilk is a chief citie oʼ that pairt oʼ Macedonia — a “Colony.” And we war in yon citie a wheen days. And on the Sabbath we gaed oot oʼ the port by a watir‐side, whaur we thocht thar wad be a place for prayer; and, sittin doon, we war speakin to the weemen that cam thegither. And a particular wumman, by name Lydia, a purple‐seller, oʼ the citie oʼ Thyatira, ane devout toward God, heard us; whase heart the Lord openʼt, that she soud tak gude tent to what Paul spak. Noo, whan she was bapteezʼt, and her househauld, she besocht us, sayin, “Gin ye hae judged me to be leal to the Lord, come awa to my hoose, and bide thar!” And she garʼd us sae do. And it cam aboot, as we war gaun to the place oʼ prayer, a lass wiʼ a spirit oʼ magic met us, wha brocht her maisters muckle siller by her soothsayin. This ane, followin Paul and us, was aye crying oot, “Thir men are  servants oʼ the Maist Heigh God; wha are airtin ye iʼ the way oʼ salvation!” And this she was doin a gey wheen days. But Paul, sair putten‐aboot, turned and said to the spirit, “I chairge ye, iʼ the name oʼ Jesus Christ, to come oot oʼ her!” And it cam oot that vera ʼoor. But her owners, seein that eke the hope oʼ their gains was thus far‐awaʼ, laid haud on Paul and Silas, and harlʼt them intil the merkit‐place to the rulers, And bringin them afore the magistrates, quoʼ they, “Thir men are an unco pest to oor citie — they bein Jews — “And are settin forth customs that are naither to be acceptit nor dune — we bein Romans.” And aʼ the thrang raise up again them: and the magistrates strippin aff their claes, gae orders to clour them wiʼ rods. And, layin on them mony  stripes, they cuist them intil the Toʼbooth, chairgin the jailer to keep them siccar. Wha, on siccan a chairge as this, cuist them intil the benmaist dungeon, and stellʼd their feet siccar iʼ the stocks. And aboot the midnicht, Paul and Silas war prayin, and hymnin God; and the prisoners war hearin them. And aʼ at ance cam a great yirdin, sae that the fundations oʼ the prison trimlʼt; and at ance aʼ doors unsteekit, and aʼ bonds war lowsed. Noo the jailer, raisʼd oot oʼ his sleep, and seein aʼ the prison‐doors unsteekit, drawin his blade, wad hae made awa wiʼ his sel, thinkin the prisoners aʼ fled. But Paul cryʼt oot wiʼ a lood voice, “Lat nae skaith come tʼye! for we are aʼ here!” And he caʼd for a licht, and rushed in; and trimlʼt, and fell doon afore Paul and Silas, And bringin them oot, said, “My Lords, what maun I be doin, that I may be savʼd?” And they said, “Hae faith in the Lord Jesus, and ye sal be savʼd; yersel and yere hoose!” And they spak to him the word oʼ the Lord, and to aʼ that war in his hoose. And, takin them wiʼ him, in that ʼoor oʼ the nicht, he weshʼd their stripes, and was bapteezʼt, he and aʼ his, on the spot. And feshin them intil his apairtments, he set a table afore them, and had unco rejoicin, wiʼ aʼ his hoosehauld — believin in God. But whan day cam, the magistrates sent to the officers, sayin, “Let gang thae men!” And sae the jailer tellʼt the words to Paul, “The magistrates hae sent that ye micht gang; sae noo, gaun forth, depairt in peace!” But Paul said, “They hae cloured us in public — and uncondemned — men that are Romans, and they hae cuisten us intil a dungeon; and noo dae they send us oot hidlins? No sae! but lat them come their sels and lead us oot!” Noo the officers took back to the magistrates thir declarations; and they war taen wiʼ fear, hearin they war Romans; And, comin, they besocht them; and, leadin them oot, they entreatit them to gang awa frae the citie. And they, comin oot oʼ the Toʼbooth, gaed to Lydia; and, seein the brethren, they consoled them; and gaed awa. Sae, gaun on throwe Amphipolis and Apollonia, they cam intil Thessalonica, whaur the Jews had a kirk. And Paul, eʼen as he aye did, gaed in to them; and for thrie  Sabbaths reasoned wiʼ them frae the word, Openin up and makin plain, that it was necessar for the Anointit Ane to suffer, and to rise frae amang the deid, and that “This vera Ane is the Anointit, eʼen Jesus, wham I am settin forth amang ye!” And a wheen frae ʼmang them war perswadit, and cuist in their lot wiʼ Paul and Silas; as weel as the devout Greeks vera mony, and a hantle oʼ weemen, eʼen the chief anes. But the Jews, ill pleased, and takin to theirsels the merkit‐men, ill‐deedie loons — and makin a bruilzie, set aʼ the city in an uproar; and, makin an onset on Jasonʼs hoose, they socht to gie them ower to the rabble. But no finding them, they harled Jason and a wheen ither brethren to the rulers, cryin oot, “Thae that hae thrawn aʼ the inhabited yirth intil a tulzie — the same hae come here! “And Jason has gien them welcome; and thir are aʼ contrar to the laws oʼ Cesar, sayin, ‘Thar is anither King, Jesus!’ ” And the rulers, and aʼ the folk, war unco putten‐aboot, whan they heard thae things. And, takin caution frae Jason and the lave, they loot them gang. And the brethren at ance, by nicht, sent aff baith Paul and Silas to Berea; wha, when they gat thar, gaed intil the Jewsʼ kirk. But thir men war nobler than the anes in Thessalonica, in that they welcomed the message wiʼ aefauld minds, day by day looking weel to the word, gin thir things war sae or no. And sae, a hantle oʼ them believed; and eke oʼ the Greek weemen oʼ gude estate, and oʼ men, a gey wheen. But whan the Jews oʼ Thessalonica cam to ken that the word oʼ God was preached by Paul in Berea, they cam thar as weel, steerin up the folk. And than the brethren sent oot Paul, to gang the lenth oʼ the sea; but baith Silas and Timothy bade thar still. Noo the men that airtit Paul, set him on the lenth oʼ Athens; and takin back wiʼ them word to Silas and Timothy to come to him as sune as they micht, they returned. But while Paul, in Athens, was looking for them, his heart lowed within him, perceivin that the citie was aʼ gien ower to eidols. Sae he was reasonin iʼ the kirk wiʼ the Jews and the devout anes; and iʼ the merkits ilka day wiʼ thae he met wiʼ. And some, eʼen amang the wyse anes oʼ the Stoics and Epicureans, stude up again him: and a wheen war sayin, “What, aiblins, micht this  gaberlunzie‐man be wantin to say?” Ithers spak, “He maun be a setter‐up oʼ foreign eidols;” for that he has giean oot the Blythe‐message oʼ Jesus and the Risin‐Again. And sae, layin haud oʼ him, they had him up to the Areopagus, sayin, “Can we no get to ken what this new teachin is that ye are speakin? “For ye are feshing in fremd things to our hearing: we wad ken, than, whatna things thir are?” Noo, aʼ Athenians, and the fremd folk biding thar, had leisure for nocht els, but to hear or to tell oʼ some new ferlie. And Paul, staunin in the mids oʼ the Areopagus, said, “Men! Athenians! In aʼ things how unco mindfuʼ ye are in  worship, I perceive. For as I gaed by, and took tent oʼ the objects oʼ yere worship, I lichtit on a shrine wiʼ this legend, ‘To a God no kent.’ What, than, ye adore unkennin, I mak plain to ye. “The God that made the warld, and aʼ things inʼt — he wha is Maister oʼ Heeven and yirth — no in haun‐made temples dwalls, as thoʼ he wantit ocht; “Nor wiʼ human hauns needs waitin on, sin he his sel gies aʼ their life and breath, and aʼ things. “He has made aʼ ane — ilka nation oʼ men — to bide on the face oʼ the yirth; spannin oot the seasons, and the limits oʼ their dwallin: “That they micht be seekin God; gin aiblins they micht graip eftir him, and finʼ him; thoʼ he be‐na far‐awa frae ony oʼ us. “For in him we leeve, act and exist; as eʼen thae amang yere ain bards hae said, ‘For his offspring, too, are we!’ “Bein than, Godʼs offspring, we soudna think that that whilk is Divine is like to gowd, or siller, or stane — carved wiʼ skill and device oʼ man. “The times oʼ ignorance God heedit‐na; noo, he chairges aʼ men, in aʼ places, to repent: “Inasmuckle as he has set a day, in whilk he sal judge the hail yirth in equity, by a Man that he has appointit; oʼ wham he has gien surety to aʼ men, in that he has raised him frae the deid.” But whan they heard oʼ the Risin‐frae‐the‐deid, a wheen geckʼt at him; but ither some, “We will hear ye again anent this.” Sae Paul gaed forth oot oʼ their mids. But some men wha joined theirsels to him, believed; amang them, eʼen Dionysius the Areopagite Judge, and a wumman by name Damaris, and ithers wiʼ them. Eftir thir things, leaʼin Athens, he cam to Corinth. And, lichtin on a particular Jew, by name Aquila, a Pontus man by nativity, late come frae Italy, and his wife Priscilla — for Claudius had gien orders for aʼ Jews to leaʼ Rome — he cam to them. And for that he was oʼ the same trade, he bade wiʼ them, and wrocht; for they war tent‐makers by trade. And he was reasonin iʼ the kirk ilka Sabbath; and perswadit Jews and Greeks. Than, whan baith Silas and Timothy cam doon frae Macedonia, Paul was led on in his preachin, demonstratin to the Jews that Jesus was the Anointit Ane. But as they set theirsels to oppose and revile, shakin oot his raiment, he said to them, “Yere blude be on yere ain heid; I am clear! Frae this oot I gang to the Gentiles!” And, flittin frae thence, he cam intil the hoose oʼ a man by name Titus Justus, devout toward God; whase hoose was neibor to the kirk. But Crispus, the kirk‐ruler, believed iʼ the Lord, wiʼ his hail hoosehauld. And a hantle oʼ the Corinthians, hearin, war believin, and war bapteezʼt. And the Lord said by nicht to Paul, in a vision, “Be‐na fleyʼt; and spare‐na to speak! “For I am wiʼ ye; and nane sal set upon ye, to do ye ill; for I hae a hantle oʼ folk iʼ this citie.” And he bade a year and sax month; teaching amang them Godʼs word. But when Gallio was Proconsul oʼ Achaia, the Jews made an onset on Paul, and had him up for trial. Sayin, “This ane is perswadin men to worship God, contrar to the law!” Noo, whan Paul was aboot to open his mouʼ, Gallio says to the Jews, “Gin it indeed had been a maitter oʼ stour and strife, and ill‐deedie wickedness, O Jews! I wad hae reason to thole wʼye: “But gin they be quastens anent words, and names, and laws oʼ yere ain — ye sal see to that yersels! Nae judge oʼ siccan things sal I be!” And he cuist them oot frae the coort. And they aʼ, grippin haud oʼ Sosthenes, the kirk‐ruler, cloured him iʼ the presence oʼ the coort. And Gallio  took nae heed oʼ thir things. But Paul, still bidin a gey wheen days wiʼ the brethren, than bade them fareweel, and sailed awa to Syria; and wiʼ him Aquila and Priscilla; he shavin his heid in Cenchrea, for he had made a vow: And than cam ower intil Ephesus; and he left them ahint thar; but he, his sel, gaed intil the kirk, and reasoned wiʼ the Jews. And thoʼ they war seekin to hae him bide langer, he didna consent: But bad them fareweel, sayin, “I wull come back tʼye, gin God wull!” and set sail frae Ephesus; And landin at Cesarea, and gaun up and salutin the kirk, he gaed doon to Antioch; And, takin some time, he gaed forth, gaun throwe aʼ thae pairts in order — Galatia and Phrygia — puttin heart intil the disciples. Noo, a Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian born, a man oʼ lear, cam doon to Ephesus, bein michtie iʼ the word. The same had been instruckit by hearin the way oʼ the Lord: and bein warm‐heartit, was speakin and teachin eidentlie aboot Jesus, kennin but the baptism oʼ John. He, too, begude to speak freely iʼ the Jewsʼ kirk. But Priscilla and Aquila, haein heard him, took him to them, and mair carefully exponed to him the way oʼ God. And he being ready to gang throwe intil Greece, the brethren wrate to the disciples to tak him in joyfully; wha, comin thar, helpit weel thae wha believed, wiʼ his gifts. For, wiʼ unco vigor, he publicly confoundit the Jews oot and oot, makin plain by the Word that Jesus was the Anointit Ane. And it cam aboot while Apollos was in Corinth, that Paul, gaun throwe the heigher pairts, cam intil Ephesus; and faund a wheen disciples, And to them quoʼ he, “Gat ye the Holie Spirit whan ye believed?” But they said, “On the contrar, we warna tellʼt thar was ony Holie Spirit!” And he said, “What, than, war ye bapteezʼt intil?” And quoʼ they, “Intil Johnʼs baptism.” And Paul said, “John bapteezʼt a bapteezin oʼ Repentance, sayin to the folk comin to him, that they soud pit faith in him comin eftir him, eʼen in Jesus.” Noo, hearin this, they war bapteezʼt intil the name oʼ the Lord Jesus. And Paul, pitten his hauns on them, the Holie Spirit cam doon on them, and they spak wiʼ tongues, and prophesyʼt. And they war aboot twal;  aʼ men. And he gaed intil the kirk, and spak openly for aboot thrie month; reasonin and perswadin anent Godʼs kingdom. But as a hantle oʼ them hardened theirsels, and wadna be perswadit, speakin ill oʼ “The Way” afore aʼ the folk — he left them, and set the disciples apairt, day by day discoorsin in the schule oʼ Tyrannus. Noo this gaʼed on for twa year; sae that aʼ folk dwallin iʼ the Province oʼ Asia heard the Lordʼs word; Jews and Greeks. And God did warks oʼ pooer, ayont the ordinar, by the hauns oʼ Paul. Sae that frae his body to the sick anes war carryʼt naipkins and aprons, and the illnesses gaed frae them: foul spirits eke gaed oot. But particular anes oʼ the gangrel Jews, exorcists, took on them to caʼ ower thae haeinʼ foul spirits, the name oʼ the Lord Jesus, sayin, “I depone tʼye by Jesus, preached oʼ Paul!” Noo, thar war seeven sons oʼ ane Sceva, a Jewish heigh‐priest, wha did sae. And the man wiʼ the foul spirit cryʼt, “Jesus I ken, and Paul I weel ken; but wha may ye be?” And the man the foul spirit was in, lap on them, and owercam them; sae that, disjaskit and cloured, they escapit frae that hoose. And this cam to be kent by aʼ, baith Jews and Greeks dwallin in Ephesus; and thar cam a fear on them, and the name oʼ the Lord Jesus was exaltit. And mony oʼ thae that believʼd cam, confessin openly, and turnin awa frae their practeeces. A gey wheen, too, oʼ thae that trokʼt in magical secrets feshʼt their buiks, and brunt them afore them aʼ; and they reckonʼt up what they cam to, and faund it fifty thousanʼ siller‐pieces. Sae, in sic pooer, was the word waxin and prevailin. Noo, eftir aʼ thae things, Paul had it in his heart, whan he had gane throwe Macedonia and Greece, to gang forrit tp Jerusalem; and quoʼ he, “Ance I hae been thar, it is necessar for me to see Rome as weel!” And, sendin aff into Macedonia twa oʼ thae waitin on him, Timothy and Erasus, he bade for a wee in Asia. But thar raise, at that time, an unco stour anent “The Way.” For ane, Demetrius by name, a sillersmith, makin siller shrines for Diana, was winnin for the tradesmen nae smaʼ patronage. Wham, bringin thegither, and them wha wrocht amang sic things, he said to them, “Men! ye ken weel that oot oʼ this trade we win oor gear. “And noo ye see and hear that no only at Ephesus, but nar‐haun in aʼ Asia, this Paul, perswadin, has turned awaʼ mony folk, sayin, ‘They bude be nae gods that are made wiʼ hauns.’ “And no only is thar danger that this oor trade may be ill spoken oʼ; but eʼen that the temple oʼ the great goddess Diana may be lichtlied, and aʼ her dignity puʼd down: till wham the hail oʼ Asia, and aʼ the warld gie worship!” Noo, hearin this, and bein fuʼ oʼ wrath, they made an unco cry, sayin, “Michtie is Diana oʼ the Ephesians!” And the citie was fuʼ oʼ the stour; and they panged theirsels wiʼ ae mind into the theatre, layin haud oʼ Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow‐traivellers oʼ Paulʼs. And Paul was mindit to gang in amang the thrang; but the disciples wadna lat him: And a wheen oʼ the Asiarchs  also, freends oʼ his, sent to him, entreating him no to gang into the theatre. And sae some cryʼt oot ae thing, and some anither; for the gatherin had come to be aʼ throwe‐ither, and the maist pairt kent‐na why they had forgatherʼt. And they heized up Alexander frae the mids oʼ the folk; the Jews puttinʼ him forrit; and Alexander, wavin his haun, wad hae made his defence to the folk. But whan they cam to ken he was a Jew, wiʼ ae voice they aʼ cryʼt oot, for the lenth oʼ twa ʼoors, “Michty is Diana oʼ the Ephesians!” But the Toon‐clerk, quatin doon the folk, said, “Men! Ephesians! wha oʼ men is thar that disna own that the Ephesian‐city is shrine‐keeper oʼ the great Diana, and oʼ that whilk fell doon frae Jupiter! “Thir bein things no to be gainsayed, it is needfuʼ that ye be quate, to begin wiʼ; and to do naething rash. “For ye brocht thir men — naither harryin temples, nor miscaʼin yere goddess. “Sae, gin Demetrius and the tradesmen wiʼ him, hae ony plea wiʼ ony ane, the Coort‐days are keepit, and thar are advocats; lat them implead ane anither. “But gin something mair ye seek, lat it be settled iʼ the lawfuʼ assembly. “For we are in danger oʼ bein wytit wiʼ riot and revolt, anent this day; seein we hae no a single cause to plead in giean an accoont oʼ this concoorse.” And whan thir things war said, he skailʼt the assembly. And whan the tulzie was ower, Paul sent for the disciples, and chairgin them, he quat them, and gaed oot till Macedonia. Gaun throwe thae pairts, and giean them muckle coonsel, he cam intil Greece. And haein spent thrie months, whan the Jews laid plots for him as he was gaun to sail awa till Syria, he made up his mind to gang back throwe Macedonia. And thar gaed wiʼ him the lenth oʼ Asia, Sopater oʼ Pyrrhus, a Berean; and Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius frae Derbe; and Timothy; and oʼ Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. Thir, gaun afore, war stoppin for us in Troas; While we sailed awa, eftir the days oʼ the Sad Breid, frae Philippi; and cam till them at Troas in fyve days, biding thar seeven days. And on the first day oʼ the week, whan we aʼ cam thegither to brek breid, Paul was discoorsin to them, bein ready to gang awa iʼ the morn, and spak on till midnicht. And thar war mony lichts iʼ the laft whaur we had forgatherʼt. Noo thar sat a lad, by name Eutychus, iʼ the winnock; and, as Paul was lang preachin, bein owercome wiʼ sleep, he fell frae the third laft, and was liftit up deid. But gaun doon, Paul fell on him, and pat his airms aboot him; and quoʼ he, “Be‐na makin a steer; for his life is in him!” And sae, gaun up, and brekin breid, and eatin a wee, he spak a gey while, eʼen till the dawin; and sae gaed on. And they brocht the lad leevin, and war muckle comfortit. Noo we, gaun forrit till the ship, sailed till Assos, frae thar to tak up Paul; for sae had it been trystit; he gaun on on fit. And sae whan we forgatherʼt wiʼ him at Assos, we took him up, and cam to Mitylene. And frae thar, sailin awa on the morn, we cam fornent Chios; and on the neist day we edged intil Samos; and on the neist again, we cam to Miletus. For Paul was mindit to gang by Ephesus, that he soudna aiblins spend time in Asia; for he hastit, gin it war possible for him, to be at Jerusalem again the Pentecost. Yet frae Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and socht to hae the Elders oʼ the Kirk. And whan they war come to him, he said to them, “Ye weel ken, frae the first day I set fit in Asia, hoo I was wʼye, the hail time; “Wiʼ service to the Lord in aʼ humbleness, and tears and toils, whilk cam on me by the doobleness oʼ the Jews; “And hoo I keepit naething hidlins, oʼ the things that war gude; tellin it ower tʼye, and teachin it in public, and frae ae hoose to anither. “Bearin witness baith to Jews and Greeks, anent repentance to God, and faith to oor Maister, Jesus Christ. “And noo, mark! I gang in bonds to the Spirit, journeyin to Jerusalem — kennin‐na what aiblins sal befaʼ me yonner; “But only this, that the Holie Spirit bears me witness, frae ae citie to anither, that shackles and sorrows are waitin for me. “Yet, on nae accoont, dae I haud my life loʼesome to mysel, gin sae I may end weel my coorse, and the darg gien me by the Lord Jesus; to testify to the Blythe‐message oʼ Godʼs favor! “And noo, tak tent! I ken that nae mair dae ye see my face! ye ʼmang wham I hae gane, proclaimin the Kingdom. “Sae, tak I yersels to witness, this vera day, that I am free frae the blude oʼ aʼ men. “For I keepit‐na back ocht, but spak aʼ Godʼs coonsel tʼye. “Tak tent, than, to yersels, and to aʼ the  hirsel, in whilk the Holie Spirit has set ye for bishops; to shepherd the Kirk oʼ the Lord, whilk he coft for his sel wiʼ his ain blude. “I ken, that whan I am gane, unco wolves sal come intil yere mids, devoorin the flock. “And frae amang yersels sal men rise up, speakin thrawn doctrines, sae as to wyle awa followers eftir them. “Sae tak ye gude tent; mindin, that for thrie year, by nicht and day, I gied mysel nae rest, admonishin ilka ane, wiʼ tears. “And noo, I gie ye ower to God, and to the word oʼ his gude favor; wha is strang to bigg ye up, and to gie you yere portion amang aʼ that are sanctifyʼt. “Frae nae ane wad I fain hae had siller, or gowd, or raiment. “Ye ken yersels, that thir vera hauns wrocht sair for my ain necessities, and for them that war wiʼ me. “In aʼ things I gied ye to ken that sae workin it behoves us to gie strenth to the feckless; and to keep in mind the words oʼ the Lord Jesus, whan he said, ‘Happy, raither, to gie than to get!’ ” And sayin thir things, he bowʼt his knees, wiʼ aʼ oʼ them, and prayed. And they aʼ grat sair, and faʼin on Paulʼs neck, they tenderly kissʼd him. Carin maist oʼ aʼ for what he had said, “Nae mair dae ye see my face!” And they set him on, the lenth oʼ the ship. Noo, rivin oorsels awa frae them, we set sail; and rinnin straucht on, we cam to Cos; and on the morn to Rhodes; and frae thar to Patara. And findin a ship gaun ower to Phenicia, we gaed on board and set sail. Comin in sicht oʼ Cyprus, and leaʼin it on oor left, we sailed to Syria, and pat intil Tyre; for thar was the ship to unlade. And, lichtin on disciples, we bade thar seeven days: wha war giean Paul warnin, by the Spirit, no to be gaun up till Jerusalem. And whan we had passed the days, gaun forth, we war takin up oor voyage; and they aʼ, wiʼ wives and weans, convoyed us as far as oot oʼ the citie; and we loutit doon on oor knees on the sands in prayer; And tore oorsels asunder: and we gaed intil the ship, and they turned back again tae their hames. And finishin oor voyage frae Tyre, we cam alang to Ptolemais; and salutin the brethren, we bade wiʼ them ae day. And on the morn, gaun on, we cam till Cesarea; and findin the hoose oʼ Philip the Evangelist, ane oʼ the Seeven, we bade wiʼ him. The same had fowr dochters, maidens, wha prophesyʼt. And still bidin a wheen days, ane cam doon frae Judea, a prophet, by name Agabus. And comin till us, he liftit Paulʼs girdle, and fankit his ain feet and hauns, and quoʼ he, “Thir things says the Holie Spirit, ‘The man whase aucht this girdle, sal the Jews sae binʼ in Jerusalem, and gie him intil Gentile hauns.’ ” And whan we heard thir words, we entreatit him — baith we and thae oʼ that same place — no to gang up till Jerusalem! Than answerʼt Paul, and quoʼ he, “Why wad ye be greetin, and brek my heart? for I staun ready no only to be bunʼ, but eʼen to dee, at Jerusalem, for the Lord Jesus Christ!” And sae — as he wasna to be perswadit — we quat, sayin, “The Lordʼs wull be dune!” And, eftir thae days, we packed oor luggage, and gaed up till Jerusalem. And thar gaed up wi us some oʼ the disciples oʼ Cesarea, and brocht us till ane Mnason, oʼ Cyprus, an auld disciple; whaur we war to lodge. And whan we cam till Jerusalem, the brethren war joyfuʼ to welcome us. And on the morn Paul wad gang in till James; and aʼ the Elders cam in. And, salutin them, he tellʼt them aʼ the things — ane by ane — that God had dune by him amang the Gentiles. And they, hearin, magnifyʼt God. And quoʼ they to him, “Ye see, brither, hoo mony myriads thar are amang the Jews wha believe; and they are aʼ — to begin wiʼ — unco fuʼ oʼ zeal for the Law. “Noo, they hae been tellʼt aboot ye, that ye teach a forsakin oʼ Moses, to aʼ the Jews that are ʼmang the Gentiles; sayin no to circumceese their bairns, nor walk by the auld customs. “What than wull it be? for they bude hear that ye are come. “Sae, do this we say: Fowr  men are wiʼ us, wiʼ a vow on them. “Tak ye thir wiʼ ye, and be purifyʼt wiʼ them, and gie something wiʼ them, and they sal shave their heids: and aʼ sal come to ken that the clash they heard aboot ye was naething; but that ye are keepin iʼ the ranks; mindin weel the Law. “But anent the Gentiles that believe, we hae gien oot and affirmed that they soud gaird their sels anent eidol‐sacrifeece, and blude, and frae stranglʼt, and frae lecherie.” Than Paul, takin wiʼ him the men the neist day, and bein purifyʼt wiʼ them, was gaun intil the Temple to signify the endin oʼ the days oʼ purification, till siccan a time as an offeran soud be offerʼt for ilka ane oʼ them. Whan than the seeven days war nar‐haun endit, the Jews frae Asia, seein him iʼ the Temple, made a tulzie amang the folk, and grippit him. Cryin oot, “Men! Israʼlites! coʼway and help! This is the man wha is speakin again the people, and the law, and this place everygate! Aye, and has eʼen brocht Greeks intil the Temple, and has profaned this holie place!” For afore this they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian, iʼ the citie wiʼ him; and they jaloused he had brocht him intil the Temple. And the hail citie was in a steer; and aʼ the folk ran thegither, and they harled Paul oot frae the Temple; and aʼ the doors war steekit fast. And as they ettled to slay him, news gaed to the chief officer that aʼ Jerusalem was in a tulzie. Wha at ance takin to him sodgers and captains, ran doon on them. And they, seein the officer and the sodgers, quat clourin Paul. Sae, comin on, the officer laid haud oʼ him, and orderʼt him to be bund wiʼ twa chains; and speirʼt wha he micht be? and what he had dune? But ane and anither was aye shoutin oot something els iʼ the thrang. Sae, seein he coudna get to ken for certain, on accoont oʼ the din, he orderʼt him intil the Castle. But whan they cam to the stairs, it behovʼt him to be heized up by the sodgers, sae sair was the onset oʼ the folk. For aʼ the thrang war comin eftir, and cryin oot, “Awaʼ wiʼ him!” And whan he was noo gaun intil the Castle, Paul says to the officer, “May I say something tʼye?” And he said, “Dae ye ken Greek? “Ye arena, than, yon Egyptian, that afore noo raise a revolt, and took intil the wilderness the fowr thousand men that war manslayers?” Paul said, “I am a man wha am a Jew, ane oʼ Tarsus in Cilicia; a citizen oʼ nae mean citie: and mair, I beg oʼ ye to let me speak to the folk.” And whan he had gien him leesence, Paul, staunin on the stairs, waved his haun to the thrang; and whan aʼ was quate, he spak to them iʼ the Hebrew tongue, sayin: “Men, brethren and faithers! Wull ye hear my defence afore ye, at this present?” And whan they heard that he spak to them iʼ the Hebrew speech, they keepit the mair whushʼt; and he said, “I am a man, a Jew, born in Tarsus oʼ Cilicia; but brocht up iʼ this citie, at Gamalielʼs feet, stricklie trained in aʼ the auld ways: bein frae the first fuʼ oʼ zeal for God, as aʼ ye are this day. “And I persecutit ‘The Way’ to the death, grippin and giean ower to dungeons baith men and weemen. “As eʼen the Heigh‐priest can witness for me, and aʼ the Elders: frae wham I get letters to oor brethren, and journeyʼt to Damascus, ettlin to fesh thae wha had gane thar, to Jerusalem, that they soud be dealt wiʼ. “And it cam aboot as I gaed on, and cam nar to Damascus, aboot noon, on a suddaintie, oot oʼ the lift, cam an unco licht aʼ aboot me. “And I fell to the yird; and heard a voice sayin to me, ‘Saul! Saul! why soud ye be pursuin me?’ “And I answerʼt, ‘Wha art thou, my  Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus oʼ Nazareth, that ye are pursuin!’ “And thae wiʼ me saw in fact the licht, but they kent‐na the words oʼ him speakin to me. “And I speirʼt, ‘What maun I do, my Lord?’ But the Lord said to me, ‘Up! and gae intil Damascus; and thar ye sal be tellʼt aʼ things ye hae to do!’ “And as I coudna see, for the glorie oʼ that licht, bein airtit by the haun oʼ thae that war wiʼ me, I gaed intil Damascus. “And ane Ananias, a worshippin man conform to the Law, weel‐spoken oʼ by aʼ the Jews bidin thar, “Comin in to me, and staunin ower me, says to me, ‘Saul! brither! look up!’ And I, that vera ʼoor, lookit up on him. “And he said, ‘Oor faithersʼ God appointit ye that ye micht ken his wull, and see the Richtous Ane, and hear words frae his mooth. “ ‘For ye sal be a witness for him, to aʼ men, oʼ the things ye hae seen, and did hear. “ ‘And noo why are ye delayin? Rise; be bapteezʼt, and wesh awa yere sins, prayin to his name!’ “And it cam aboot again, whan I cam back to Jerusalem, that I fell into a dwaum; “And he was sayin to me, ‘Haste ye, and gang oot frae Jerusalem; for they winna tak yere witness oʼ me!’ “And I said, ‘Lord, they ken that I pat in dungeons, and cloured iʼ the kirks, thae believin on thee! “ ‘And whan Stephen thy martyrʼs blude was shed, eʼen I mysel was staunin by, and approvin; and took chairge oʼ their cleedin what slew him.’ “But he said to me, ‘Awa! for I wull send ye oot far awa, to the nations!’ ” Noo they hearkened as far as this word; and than cryʼt aʼ oot, sayin, “Awa wiʼ siccan a ane frae the yirth! for it isna fit he soud leeve!” And as they made an ootcry, and rived their manteels, and cuist stoor intil the air, The officer gied orders to fesh him intil the castle; saying he was to be put to the test wiʼ rods, that he micht ken why they war in siclike shoutin again him. And as they war tyin him wiʼ the tows, Paul says to the captain that stude by, “Is it allooed to ye to clour a man, a Roman, and no condemned?” And whan the captain heard that, he gaed till the chief officer, sayin, “What are ye aboot? For this man is a Roman!” And the officer cam, and quoʼ he, “Tell me, are ye a Roman?” And he said, “Aye.” And the officer said, “I, wiʼ spendin muckle siller, gat this citizenship.” But Paul said, “I was born tillʼt.” Than at ance they gaed aff wha soud hae putten him to the test: and the officer was fleyʼt whan he faund he was a Roman, and that he had tied him up. And on the morn, wantin to ken till a certaintie why he was wytit by the Jews, he lowsed him frae his bonds; and orderin aʼ the Heigh‐priests, and aʼ their Cooncil, to come thegither, he feshʼt Paul doon, and set him in their mids. And lookin siccarlie at the Cooncil, Paul says, “Men! brethren! I, in a gude conscience, hae leevʼd on afore God, till this day!” And Ananias, the Heigh‐priest, gae orders to them staunin by, to clour him on the mouʼ. Than Paul said to him, “God sal clour you, ye whitit waʼ! For sit ye thar to judge me by the Law, and gar clour me, contrar to the Law?” But they staunin by said, “Dae ye speak ill oʼ Godʼs Heigh‐priest?” And Paul said, “I kent‐na, brethren, that this was the Heigh‐priest; for it is putten doon, ‘Oʼ the Ruler oʼ yere nation ye are‐na to speak ill.’ ” But whan Paul cam to ken that the ae pairt war Sadducees, and the tither pairt war Pharisees, he cryʼt oot iʼ the Cooncil, “Men! brethren! I am a Pharisee, and a bairn oʼ Pharisees! Anent the hope and Risin‐again oʼ the deid am I quaistenʼd this day!” Noo, whan he had said this, thar was a great faʼin‐oot atwixt the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the thrang was sinderʼt in twa. For the Sadducees say, “Thar is nae Risin‐again, nor ony Angel nor spirit;” but the Pharisees haud to baith. And thar raise a great cry: and a wheen oʼ the Writers oʼ the Phariseesʼ pairt raise, and contendit, sayin, “We finʼ naething wrang wiʼ this man: aiblins a spirit spak to him; or an Angel!” And whan a great thrivin took place, the chief officer, fleyʼt lest Paul soud hae been rived in blads wiʼ them, orderʼt the sodgers to gae doon and tak him wiʼ the strang haun, and fesh him intil the castle. But that nicht the Lord stude ower him, and said, “Be oʼ gude heart, Paul! for as ye did gie gude witness oʼ me in Jerusalem, sae maun ye in Rome testify for me!” And whan day cam, the Jews made a plot, and colleagued thegither under a ban, sayin they wad eat‐na and drink‐na till siccan a time as they had slain Paul. And thar war mair nor forty wha war trystit iʼ this plot. Wha, cominʼ to the  Heigh‐priests and Elders, said, “We hae putten oorsels under a great ban, that we wad eat‐na nor drink‐na till we hae slain Paul. “Noo, than, mak ye it appear to the chief officer — he bringin him doon to ye — that ye are wantin to speir oot some mair anent him: and we, or evir he comes nar, are waitin to kill him.” But Paulʼs nevoy heard oʼ their plot, and gaed, and cam intil the castle, and tellʼt it to Paul. And Paul, caʼin in ane oʼ the captains to him, said, “Tak ye this lad to the chief officer; for he has a thing to report to him.” He, than, takin him wiʼ him, led him intil the chief officer, and says, “Paul, the prisoner, caʼin me to him, wad hae me fesh this young lad to ye, as haein something to say tʼye.” And the chief officer, took him by the haun, and gaed aside, and speirʼt at him, “What isʼt that ye hae to report to me?” And he said, “The Jews seek that on the morn ye wad bring Paul doon to the Cooncil, as gin they wad speir oot something mair anent him. “But gie ye no in tae them! for thar are waitin oʼ them mair nor forty men, wha hae putten their sels under a great ban, to eat‐na and drink‐na till they hae killʼt him: and eʼen noo are they waitin, lookin for a promise frae ye.” The chief officer than demittit the lad, giean him chairge, “Lat nae man ken that ye hae tellʼt thir things to me!” And caʼin to him twa oʼ the captains, he said “Mak ready twa hunner sodgers, that they may gang the lenth oʼ Cesarea; and seeventy horsemen: and twa hunner spear‐men — by nine oʼclock. “And provide beass, that, pittin Paul tharon, they may bring him till Felix the Governor.” And he wrate a letter thus: “Claudius Lysias, to the maist excellent Governor Felix: gude wishes! “This man was grippit by the Jews; and wad hae been slain by them; than cam I doon wiʼ a force and rescued him, comin to ken that he was a Roman. “And, desirin to ken for what they war wytin him, I led him doon to their Heigh‐Cooncil: “And perceivʼt him to be wytit wiʼ things oʼ their ain law, but accusʼt oʼ naething wordie oʼ death or bonds. “And whan it was tellʼt me that thar was a plot again the man, to be cairryʼt oot by them, I sent him to you; telling his accusers that they micht speak afore you again him.” Sae the sodjers, as it was orderʼt them, took Paul, and brocht him iʼ the nicht till Antipatras. But on the morn, they gaed back to the castle, and loot the horsemen gang on wiʼ him. Wha, comin till Cesarea, and giean the letter to the Governor, presentit Paul to him. And he, haein read the letter, and speirʼt oʼ what Province he was, whan he kent he was oʼ Cilicia, “I wull hear ye,” quoʼ he, “whan yere accusers sal come”; giean orders he soud be keepit iʼ the palace oʼ Herod, under gaird. And, fyve days eftir, the Heigh‐priest cam doon, wiʼ a wheen oʼ the Elders; and a spokesman, ane Tertullus; and deponed again Paul afore the Governor. And whan he was caʼd, Tertullus begude to mak accusation, sayin, “Inasmuckle as by you we obteen great peace, and gude comes to this nation throwe yere wisdom, “We receive it aye, and in ilka place, maist excellent Felix, wiʼ aʼ thanks. “But, that I be‐na wearisome tʼye, I entreat ye to hear us, iʼ yere courtesie, for a wee wheen words. “For, findin this man a pest, and teachin treason amang aʼ the Jews iʼ the hale inhabited‐warld, and a heid ane oʼ the sect oʼ the Nazarenes; “Wha ettled to pollute eʼen the Temple: him we grippit, and wad hae tried conform to oor Law; “But the chief officer Lysias cam wiʼ muckle pooer, and tuik him oot oʼ oor hauns; “Orderin his accusers to come to you; frae wham ye yersel wull be able, on speirin anent aʼ thir things, to establish wiʼ accuracy, aʼ that we wyte him wiʼ.” And the Jews aʼ joined iʼ the chairge, threepin that thir things war sae. And whan the Governor had signed for him to speak, Paul answerʼt, “Inasmuckle as I ken ye hae been thir mony year judgin this nation, I dae wiʼ gude heart mak my defence, “Seein that ye may mak oot clearly, that nae mair days are gane nor twalʼ, sinʼ I gaed up till Jerusalem to worship, “And naither faund they me iʼ the Temple argle‐barglin wiʼ ony ane, or gaitherin a thrang, nor yet iʼ the kirks, nor iʼ the citie. “Nor can they lead prufe oʼ what they noo wyte me wiʼ. “But this muckle I confess tʼye, that, conform to ‘The Way,’ whilk they caʼ a Schism, sae dae I serʼ my faitherʼs God; hauding fast aʼ thae things that are putten doon iʼ the Law and iʼ the Prophets. “Haein a hope wiʼ God, whilk they theirsels haud, that thar sal be a Risin‐again baith oʼ the gude and the ill. “And oʼ this I am makin a task, to hae a gude conscience aye; baith toward God and man. “Noo, eftir a gude wheen years, I cam to fesh aumous to my nation, and offerans: “Amang whilk they faund me, purifyʼt iʼ the Temple; no wiʼ aʼ thrang, nor wiʼ ony steer; “But a wheen Jews frae Asia made the steer: wha sud hae been here, and makin accusation, gin they had ocht again me. “Or lat thir here tell what ill they faund in me, as I stude afore the Cooncil; “Gin it be‐na for this ae thing, whan I cryʼt oot, staunin amang them, ‘Anent the Risin‐frae the deid am I wytit afore ye this day!’ ” But Felix delayʼt them, to hae mair certain knowledge oʼ “The Way”; sayin, “Whan Lysias the chief officer sal come doon, I wull determine yere maitter.” Giean orders to the captain to keep him, and alloo proper freedom, and hinder nane oʼ his ain acquaintance frae comin to him. And eftir a wheen days, Felix cam wiʼ Drusilla his ain wife, a Jewess; and sent for Paul, and listened to him anent the faith in Christ. Noo, as he was reasonin oʼ justness, and self‐guidin, and a Judgment to come, Felix was terrifyʼt, and quoʼ he, “Gae yere ways enoo; but whan I fin a  fit time, I wull send for ye.” And he was lookin that siller micht hae been gien him by Paul: sae he sent for him aftener, and had converse wiʼ him. But whan twa year had gane by, Felix was succeedit by Portius Festus; and, to gain favor wiʼ the Jews, Felix left Paul a prisoner. And whan Festus was come intil the Province, eftir thrie days, he gied up to Jerusalem. Than the Heigh‐priest, and the heid‐men oʼ the Jews, deponed again Paul, and entreatit him, And socht for thirsels a favor again him; seekin that he wad send for him to Jerusalem; haein a plot to kill him on the way. But Festus answerʼt, that on the ae haun, Paul was keepit in ward in Cesarea; and on the ither haun, that he himself was gaun doon shortly. “Lat them, than,” quoʼ he, “wha hae pooer amang ye, gae doon wiʼ me, and wyte this man, gin thar be ony wrang in him.” And eftir he bade amang them no mair than aucht or ten days, he gaed doon to Cesarea; and on the morn, sittin in judgment, orderʼt Paul to be brocht. And whan he cam, the Jews that had come doon frae Jerusalem stude roond aboot, and led mony and sair chairges again Paul, that they coudna mak gude. While Paul defendit himsel: “Naither again the Jewsʼ Law, nor again the Temple, nor again Cesar, hae I dune wrang ava!” But Festus, willin to do the Jews a favor, answerʼt Paul, “Are ye ready to gang up to Jerusalem? thar, anent thir things, to be judged afore me?” But Paul said, “I am staunin fornent Cesarʼs judgment‐seat, whaur I soud staun; to the Jews I hae dune nae wrang; eʼen as ye canna but perceive. “For gin — on the ae haun — I be a wrang‐doer, or hae dune ocht wordie oʼ death, I am ready to dee: or — on the ither haun — gin the things they wyte me wiʼ are naething, nae man can grant me as a favor to them! I appeal tae Cesar!” Than Festus, whan he had speech wiʼ his Coonsellers, answerʼt, “To Cesar ye hae appealʼd; to Cesar ye sal gang!” And eftir a wheen days had gane by, Agrippa the King, and Bernice, cam doon to Cesarea, and salutit Festus. And as they bade thar a gude wheen days, Festus laid Paulʼs case afore the King; and quoʼ he, “Thar is a particular man left in ward by Felix; “Anent wham, whan I was at Jerusalem, the Heigh‐priests and Elders oʼ the Jews laid information; “To wham I made answer, ‘It isna the way oʼ the Romans to gie up a man as a favor, afore the accused hae the accusers face to face, and hae liberty to mak his defence for his sel, anent the wrang he is wytit wiʼ.’ “And sae, whan they war come here, wiʼ nae delay I sat on the tribunal, and orderʼt the man to be brocht. “Anent wham, whan his accusers stude up, they brocht forrit nae sic ill things as I was lookin for: “But some quaistens anent their ain worship; and oʼ ane Jesus, wha is deid; but wham Paul threepit was leevin. “And, seein I was dubious aboot sic quaistens, I speirʼt at him, ‘Gin he wad gang to Jerusalem, and thar be tried concernin the things?’ “But as Paul appealʼd to the hearin oʼ the Emperor, I commandit him to be keepit till sic time as I micht send him up to Cesar.” And  Agrippa says to Festus, “I am mindit to hear the man myself!” “The morn,” quoʼ he, “ye sal hear him.” Sae, on the morn, whan Agrippa was come, and Bernice, wiʼ unco display, and war enterʼt intil the place oʼ hearin, wiʼ baith captains oʼ thoosands, and the heid men oʼ the citie, at Festusʼ orders Paul was brocht oot. And Festus says, “King Agrippa, and aʼ men here convened, ye see this man, anent wham ane and aʼ oʼ the Jews made a plea wiʼ me, baith in Jerusalem and here, cryin oot that he soudna be allooʼd to leeve ony langer. “But I gaitherʼt that naething wordie oʼ death had he dune. But as this man himsel appealed to the Emperor, I determined to send him. “Anent wham I hae naething certain to write to my lord. Sae I hae brocht him afore you, and mair particularly afore thee, King Agrippa, to the end that frae the examination had, I micht hae something I could write: “For it disna seem reasonable to me, to send a prisoner, and no wiʼ him the chairges laid again him.” Than Agrippa said, “It is permittit ye to speak anent yersel. And Paul waved his haun, and answerʼt for his sel. “I coont mysel happy, King Agrippa, for that I may mak my defence afore you this day anent the things  Jews wyte me wiʼ. “And the mair, as I ken ye are weel‐acquant wiʼ aʼ things belangin to the Jews, baith oʼ customs and oʼ quaistens. Thus I entreat ye to hear me patiently. “The way oʼ my life, frae youth, whilk was at first amang my ain folk at Jerusalem, ken aʼ Jews. “Inasmuckle as they war takin tent to me frae the first — gin aiblins they war able to testify — that, accordin to the straitest sect oʼ oor religion, I leeved a Pharisee. “And nooʼ for a hope oʼ the promise God made to oor faithers, I am staunin to be judged. “To whilk promise, oor nation oʼ twal tribes, wiʼ intensitie oʼ service, nicht and day, hope to attain: anent whilk promise, O King, I am wytit by Jews. “What! is it no to be believʼd wiʼ you, that God raises the deid? “I indeed thocht within mysel that I soud do unco mony things contrar to the name oʼ Jesus oʼ Nazareth. “Whilk I did in Jerusalem; and mony oʼ the saunts barred I in dungeons, receivin authoritie frae the Heigh‐priests; and whan they war putten to deid, I gied my vote again them. “And, takin vengeance on them aften, in aʼ the kirks, I strave to mak them blaspheme; and bein uncolie enraged again them, I pursued them the lenth oʼ foreign cities. “And inasmuckle as I was gaun to Damascus, wiʼ authoritie and orders frae the Heigh‐priest, “At middle‐day, on the road, I saw, O King, frae the lift, aboon the splendor oʼ the sun, a licht that lowed roond aboot me, and them that gaed wiʼ me; “And whan we had aʼ faun to the yird, I heard a voice speakin to me iʼ the Hebrew tongue, ‘Saul! Saul! why are ye pursuin me? It is ill for ye to kick again the prods!’ “And I said, ‘Wha are you, my Lord!’ And he says, ‘I am Jesus, wham ye are pursuing! “ ‘But rise ye, and staun on yere feet; for to this end hae I appearʼt to ye; to fit ye to be a helper and a witness, baith oʼ what ye hae seen, and iʼ thae things I sal appear tʼye: “ ‘Deliverin ye frae amang the folk, and frae the nations, amang wham I am sendin ye forth. “ ‘To unsteek their een, that they may turn them aboot frae the mirk intil the licht, and frae Sautanʼs rule to God; that they may hae their sins forgiʼen, and hae their lot amang them wha are sanctifyʼt by faith in me.’ “Wharfor, King Agrippa, I wasna dour anent the heevenlie vision: “But made kent to aʼ thae in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and to aʼ the pairts oʼ Judea as weel, and to aʼ the nations, that they soud repent and turn to God, doin warks wordie oʼ their repentance. “On accoont oʼ thir things, Jews, grippin me iʼ the Temple, ettlʼt to slay me wiʼ their ain hauns. “Sae than, haein help oʼ God, to this day I staun, bearin witness baith to smaʼ and great; sayin nae ither word than thae things that baith the prophets and Moses said soud come; “That the Christ bude suffer, gin he (foremaist oʼ thae that soud rise frae the deid!) wad declare licht baith to the folk and to the nations!” But while he was sayin thir thing in his defence, Festus, cryin oot, says, “Ye are wud, Paul! Yere lear is garrin ye be dementit!” But quoʼ Paul, “I am‐na wud, maist noble Festus! but declarations oʼ truth and oʼ a soond mind am I settin forth! “For weel kens the King aboot thir things; afore wham eʼen wiʼ aʼ freedom am I speakin: for I am no perswadit that ony oʼ thae things hae escapit him; for this wasna dune hidlins. “Hae ye faith, King Agrippa, in the prophets? I ken ye hae faith!” And Agrippa says to Paul, “Wiʼ a wee fleechin think ye to mak me a Christian?” And Paul: “I wad pray to God, that wiʼ little or muckle, no only yersel, but aʼ that hear me this day, micht come to be sic sort as I am — barrin thir shackles!” And the King raise, and the governor, and Bernice as weel, and they that sat wiʼ them. And haein withdrawn, they spak among their sels, sayin, “This man dis naething wordie oʼ shackles or dungeon!” And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man coud hae been set free, gin he hadna appealed to Cesar!” And whan it was settlʼt that we war to sail to Italy, thay gied ower Paul and a wheen ither prisoners to a captain by name Julius, oʼ Augustusʼ band. And, gaun on board a ship oʼ Adramyttium, aboot to be sailin for the seaports oʼ Asia, we pat to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian oʼ Thessalonica bein wiʼ us. And on the morn we pat into Sidon; and Julius courteouslie treatin Paul, gied him liberty to gang to his freends and be enterteenʼd. And frae thar we pat oot to sea, and sailed to the lee oʼ Cyprus, for that the winʼ was contrar. And, sailin ower the sea aff Cilicia and Pamphylia, we cam to Myra, oʼ Lycia. And thar, the captain finʼin an Alexandrian ship gaun to Italy, pat us on board her. But, for a gude wheen days, gaun cannilie, and wiʼ some fash winnin fornent Cnidus — the winʼ no allooin us to reach thar — we sailed aneath the lee oʼ Crete, ower fornent Salmone. And wiʼ muckle wark coastin on, we cam till a particular place caʼd “Fair Havens,” nar whilk was a citie, Lasea. But a gude space oʼ time bein taen up, and sailin bein noo dangerous — for the Fast was eʼen noo gane by — Paul gied them advisement, Saying to them, “Sirs, I see that the voyage wull be wiʼ skaith and muckle loss, no alane to the lade and the ship, but eke oʼ our lives.” But the captain took mair tent to what the ship‐master and the owner said, than to the things spoken by Paul. And mair: the harbor no bein safe to winter in, the feck oʼ them gied advice to set sail oot, gin by ony means they micht aiblins mak Phenice; thar to winter: whilk is a harbour oʼ Crete, as ane looks  Sou?-?wast and Nor‐wast. Noo, a south win saftly blawin, thinkin they had gotten what they wantit, weighin the anchor, they sailed alang Crete, nar to the shore. But no lang eftir, thar struck her a winʼ, a tornado, caʼd “The East‐Norʼ‐Easter”; And the ship, bein flauchtit awa, and no bein able to look the win iʼ the face, we gied her up, and war carryʼt alang. And rinnin aneath the lea oʼ a smaʼ island caʼd Clauda, we war jimply able to secure the boat. Whilk haein taen up, they war usin helps, frappin the ship: and jalousin they micht be cuisten on the Great Quicksand, they loot the veschel gang; sae thae war carryʼt alang. But, bein uncolie tossed wiʼ the tempest, on the morn they begude to fling the ladin overboard; And on the third, the tacklin oʼ the ship. But naither sun nor starns blinkin on us for mony days, and an unco storm lyin on us, at the end aʼ hope oʼ bein deliverʼt was gane. But whan they had been lang wantin meat, Paul, staunin amang them said, “Sirs, ye soud hae listenʼt tae me, and no hae been settin sail frae Crete, to win this skaith and loss. “And, at this present, I coonsel ye to be oʼ gude heart; for loss oʼ life thar sal be nane amang ye; but the loss oʼ the ship. “For ane stude by me this nicht, an Angel oʼ God, whase I am, and to wham I pay service, “Sayin, ‘Fear‐ye‐na, Paul! Afore Cesar ye sal staun: and behauld! God has gien to ye aʼ them that sail wʼye.’ “Sae, be oʼ gude heart, Sirs! for I hae faith in God that sae it sal be — iʼ the way tellʼt to me: “Thoʼ on a particular island we man be wreckʼt.” But whan the fowrteenth nicht was noo come, as we war driven aboot in Adria, aboot the midnicht the sailors jaloused that some kintra was drawin nar‐haun. And soondin, they faund it twenty faddoms; and gaun a wee on, and soondin again, they faund fyfteen faddoms. And, dreidin they micht aiblins be wreckʼt in some rocky bit, they cuist fowr anchors oot oʼ the stern, and wishʼt for the day. But whan the sailors war seekin to escape oot oʼ the ship, and had loutit doon the boat intil the sea, as gin they wad tak oot anchors frae the bow, Paul says to the captain, and to the sodgers, “Gin thae bide‐na iʼ the ship, ye canna be deliverʼt!” Than the sodgers cast awa the tows oʼ the boat, and loot her faʼ aff. And till siccan a time as the dawin cam, Paul was entreatin them aʼ to tak meat, sayin, “A fowrteenth day, this day, are ye makin, wantin meat, and giean yersels naething; “Sae, I entreat ye, tak some meat; for this is for yere gude; for no a hair oʼ the heid oʼ ony oʼ ye sal perish!” And haein said thir things, he took a laif, and gied thanks to God afore them aʼ, and breckin it, begude to eat. And sae, takin up gude heart, they theirsels took meat. Noo we war — the hail number oʼ sauls iʼ the ship — twa hunner and seeventy‐sax. And whan they had eaten eneuch, they eased the ship, thrawin oot the wheat intil the sea. And whan the day cam, they didna ken the lanʼ, but takin tent oʼ a particular cove, wiʼ a strand, they war ettlin, gin it war possible, to drive the ship in. And, cuttin awa the anchors, they loot them gang intil the sea; and lowsin the lashin oʼ the rudders, and heizin up the foresail to the gale, they held for the strand. But, faʼin intil a place whaur twa currents met, they ran the ship a‐grunʼ: the bow remained fast, and was immovable; but the stern brak intil pieces wiʼ the onset oʼ the waves. Noo, the sodgers ettled to slay the prisoners, sae that nane oʼ them soud soom oot and get awa. But the captain, wha desirʼt to deliver Paul, keepit them frae their intention, and direckit thae that coud soom — pittin aff first — to get to the lanʼ; And the lave, some on deals, and some on ither things oʼ the ship. And sae it cam aboot, that aʼ war brocht safely throwe to the lanʼ. And whan we had gotten safely throwe, than we kent that the island was caʼd Melita. And the barbaric folk schawed us unco kindness; for they luntit a fire, and took us in, on accoont oʼ the rain that set in, and the cauld. But whan Paul had gaitherʼt some eldin, and had putten it on the fire, a viper cam oot wiʼ the heat, and grippit on his haun. And whan the folk saw the beasʼ hingin frae his haun, they said ane to anither, “To a certaintie this man is a murderer; and thoʼ he has escapit the sea, yet Justice suffers‐na to leeve!” Natheless, he sheuk aff the beasʼ intil the lowe, and gat nae skaith: Thoʼ they war lookin that he wad hae swalled, or faun doon deid. But whan they had waitit a lang time, and naething gaed wrang wiʼ him, they changed their minds, and quoʼ they, “He is a god!” Noo, iʼ thae pairts was the estate oʼ the heid man oʼ the isle, by name Publius; wha made us welcome, and enterteened us thrie days wiʼ aʼ courtesie. But sae it was, that Publiusʼ faither was ill oʼ a fivver and a bludie lax; and Paul, comin in, laid his hauns on him and prayed, and healed him. And whan this had taen place, the ithers wha iʼ the isle had illnesses, cam forrit, and war healed; Wha, too, wiʼ mony kindnesses favorʼt us; and whan we sailed awa, they pressʼt on us sic things as we micht need. And eftir thrie months we set sail in a ship that had been winterin iʼ the isle, an Alexandrian ship, wiʼ an ensign, “The Twin‐Brithers.” And caʼin in at Syracuse, we staid thar thrie days; And frae thar, wiʼ a sweep we cam roond to Rhegium; and eftir ae day a South win raise, and on the second day we wan to Puteoli; Whaur we faund brethren, and war entreatit oʼ them to bide seeven days; and sae toward Rome we gaed. And whan frae thar the brethren heard tell oʼ us, they cam oot to meet us the lenth oʼ “Appii Forum” and “Thrie Taverns”; and seein them Paul blessʼd God, and took heart. And whan we war enterʼt Rome, Paul had leesance to bide by himsel, wiʼ a sodger wha had ward oʼ him. And it cam aboot, eftir thrie days, he caʼd thegither to him the heid men oʼ the Jews; and whan they had forgatherʼt, he said to them. “Men! brethren! I, haeʼin dune naething contrar to oor folk, or the customs oʼ oor faithers, was gien up oot oʼ Jerusalem to the Romans. “Wha, examinin me, wad hae releasʼt me, for that thar was no a cause oʼ death in me. “But as the Jews protestit, I bude to appeal to Cesar — no as gin I had ocht again my ain nation. “And sae I hae sent for ye, to see and speak wiʼ ye; for it is for the Hope oʼ Israʼl this chain dae I bear!” But they said to him, “We oorsels naither had letters aboot ye frae Judea, nor did ony oʼ the brethren come and report ony ill oʼ ye. “But we wad ye soud gie us yere mind; for anent this Sect, it is kent to us that it is on every‐haun condemned.” Sae, haein set a day, a hantle oʼ them cam to him at his lodgin; and to them he exponed, testifyin oʼ the kingdom oʼ God, and perswadin them anent Jesus, baith frae Moses and the prophets, frae the dawin to the gloamin. And some war perswadit oʼ the things he spak; and ithers war dour. And ʼgreein‐na amang their sels, they retirʼt; Paul giean them ae word: “Weel said the Holie Spirit by Esaiah the Prophet to yere faithers, sayin: “ ‘Gang yere ways to this folk, and say, Wiʼ hearin ye sal hear, and no comprehend; and seein, sal ye see, and no behauld; “ ‘For gross has this folkʼs heart become; and wiʼ dour lugs they hear‐na; and their een hae they steekit; least they soud see wiʼ their een, and hear wiʼ their lugs, and wiʼ their heart understaun, and soud turn again, and I soud heal them.’ “Be it kent to ye, than, that this salvation oʼ God is offerʼt to the nations; and they wull hear it!” And whan he had said this, the Jews gaed awa, and had unco argle‐barglin amang their sels. And he was a hail  twa‐year in his ain hired dwallin, and welcomed aʼ that cam in to him. Settin forth the kingdom oʼ God, and exponin the things anent the Lord Jesus Christ, wiʼ aʼ freedom oʼ speech, nane hinderin him. Paul, a servitor oʼ Christ Jesus, a bidden Apostle, sutten apairt to Godʼs Joyfuʼ‐message, Whilk he promised afore, throwe his prophets iʼ the holie writins, Anent his Son, wha cam oʼ Dauvidʼs seed by the flesh, Wha was owned to be Godʼs Son wiʼ micht, eʼen as to the Spirit oʼ Holiness, by a Risin‐frae‐the‐deid   — Jesus Christ oor Lord: By wham we had gien till us tender love and Apostleship, toward lealness oʼ faith in aʼ nations, for his nameʼs sake: Oʼ wham are ye, as weel; bidden anes oʼ Jesus Christ; To aʼ thae that are in Rome, Godʼs beloved, bidden saunts; tender love till ye, and peace, frae God oor Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ! First, I am giean thanks to my God, by Jesus Christ, anent ye aʼ for that yere faith is made mention oʼ in aʼ the warld. For God is witness for me, him that I serʼ in my spirit, iʼ the Joyfuʼ‐message oʼ his Son, hoo constantly I am speakin oʼ ye; Aye in my prayers makin request, gin that by some means, eʼen noo at ony time I soud see a gate to gang, wiʼ the wull oʼ God, till ye. For I am fain to see you, that I may gie some spirit‐gift tʼye, that ye may be made siccar; That is, that we may hae a comfortin thegither by oor common faith — yours and mine. But I wadna ye war misleared, brethren, hoo that aft I ettled to come tʼye — but was hinderʼt, eʼen till noo — that I micht hae some frute amang you, eʼen as amang the lave oʼ the nations. Baith to Greeks and barbarians, baith to wyss and simple, am I debtor: Thus am I sae fain to gie oot the Joyfuʼ‐message, eʼen to you, that are in Rome. For I am na blate anent the Joyfu‐message; for it is Godʼs pooer to save ilka ane wha lippens; first to the Jew, and eke to the Greek. For the richtousness oʼ God, throwe faith, to thae that hae faith, is thus made plain, eʼen as it is putten doon, “The just sal leeve by faith.” For Godʼs wrath is made kent frae Heeven, again aʼ ungodliness and wickedness oʼ men, wha in wickedness haud the truth under: Inasmuckle as that whilk may be kent oʼ God is made plain amang them; for God has made it kenspeckle. For the invisible things oʼ him, eʼen frae the warldʼs creation, are made plain to be seen by the things that are creatit — eʼen his eternal pooer and Godheid; that they micht hae nae excuse: For, comin to ken God, they magnifyʼt him‐na as God, nor gied him thanks; but their reasons war feckless, and their doitit heart was mirk. Settin‐up to be wyss, they becam fules; And changin, they tint the glorie oʼ the incorruptible God in the form oʼ an image oʼ corruptible man, and birds, and fowr‐fittit beass, and crawlin things. Sae God eʼen gied them ower to vileness, iʼ the uncleanness oʼ their hearts; sae as eʼen to dishonour their ain bodies amang theirsels: Wha trokit awa Godʼs truth for a lee, and gied worship and service to what is made, raither than to the Maker — wha is blessed for aye; Amen! Sae for this, God gied them up to vile passions; for eʼen their weemen did change the natʼral use for what is contrar to natur; And eʼen sae the men, quattin the wumman, burned wiʼ desire ane to anither; men wiʼ men actin unseemly, and receivin in theirsels the reward oʼ their error as was due. And eʼen as they didna seek to keep God iʼ their mind, God gied them ower to a reprobate heart, to do things no fittin: Bein fuʼ oʼ aʼ unholiness, wickedness, selliness, malignity; fuʼ oʼ envie, blude, strife; twa‐faced; spitefuʼ; tale‐pyets; Backbiters, haters oʼ God, insolent, liftit‐up, boasters, inventors oʼ ill, risin up again parents, Wantin sense, breckers oʼ covenants, wantin natʼral affection, wantin kindness; Wha, kennin the holie sentence oʼ God, that they wha dae sic things are wordie oʼ death, no alane dae them, but are colleaguin wiʼ thae that sae practeese. Sae, ye are eʼen wantin aʼ excuse, O man! whasaever ye may be, that are condemnin; for whaur ye are condemnin anither, ye are condemnin yersel; for ye wha are wytin are siclike doin. But we ken that the judgment oʼ God is true, on thae practeesin sic things as thir. And are ye lippenin to this, O man! wha are condemnin thae that practeese sic things as thir, and yet are doin them, that ye sal escape the judgment oʼ God? Or, dae ye licthlie the unco kindness, and forbearin, and lang‐tholin oʼ God; no takin tent that Godʼs gudeness wad fain lead ye to repentance? But, wiʼ yere dour and unrepentin heart, ye are heapin up for yersel wrath in wrathʼs day, and the schawin‐forth oʼ Godʼs richtous condemnation: Wha will gie to ilk ane eʼen as his warks sal be; To thae, on the ae‐haun, wha by patient continuin in gude warks, seek for glorie, honor, and immortality — life eternal: To thae, on the ither haun, wha contend, and follow‐na the truth, but follow ill — anger and wrath. Dool and pain on ilka manʼs saul wha works oot ocht that is ill, baith to the Jew first, and eke to the Greek: But glorie, and honor, and peace, to ilka ane wha dis that whilk is gude; baith to the Jews first, and eke to the Greek. For thar is nae walin‐oot oʼ faces wiʼ God! For as mony as hae sinned, wantin the law, sal eke perish wantin the law; and as mony as hae sinned aneath the law, sal be condemned aneath the law. For it isna thae that hear the law that staun richt wiʼ God; but thae wha do the law sal be appruvʼd. For whan fremʼd folk, thae wha hae nae law, do by natur the warks oʼ the law — thir, wantin the law, are to thirsels a law: Wha in vera deed gie prufe oʼ the lawʼs wark, whilk is graven on their hearts; their conscience giean testimonie in their thochts, by excusin or else wytin them, In the day whan God sal judge aʼ the secrets oʼ men, throwe Jesus Christ, eʼen accordin to my joyfu‐message. But if ye, caʼin yersel a “Jew,” staun on “Law,” and boast in God, And ken his wull, and appruve the best things, and hae yere lear iʼ the Law, And are perswadit that ye are yersel a leader oʼ blinʼ anes, a licht to aʼ iʼ the mirk, A guide for ignorant anes, a teacher oʼ bairns, haein the shapin oʼ lear and truth in the Law: Ye, than, that tell anither! why dae‐ye‐na tell yersel? Ye that are sayin, “Ane soudna steal!” dae ye steal? Ye that bid men no to commit adultery; dae ye commit adultery? Ye that scunner at eidols, dae ye rob the temples? Ye that hae yere boast iʼ the “Law,” dae ye brek the Law, and dishonor God? For the name oʼ God, on yere accoont, is dishonored amang the nations; eʼen as it has been putten‐doon. For, on the ae‐haun, circumceesion is a gain, gin ye are keepin the Law; but, on the ither haun, gin ye be a breker oʼ the Law, than yere circumceesion has come to be uncircumceesion! Gin aiblins then, the uncircumceesed keep the holie biddens oʼ the Law, winna the uncircumceesion be coontit as circumceesion? And the uncircumceesion oʼ natur, gin it cairries oot the Law, sal condemn you, wha wiʼ the letter and circumceesion, brek throwe the law! For he isna the “Jew,” wha is but  ane ootwardly; nor is circumceesion whilk is seen iʼ the flesh, the “Circumceesion!” But he is the “Jew” wha is ane within; and true circumceesion is the circumceesion oʼ the heart — in spirit, no in name, whase acceptance isna oʼ men, but oʼ God. What way, than, is the Jew heigher? or what gets he oot oʼ his circumceesion? Muckle aʼ ways; first this, that they war gien the word oʼ God. For what gin some oʼ them had doots? Sal their doots mak in vain lippenin to God? Never! But lat God be true and ilka man a leear; eʼen as it is putten doon, “To the end thy words soud be uphauden, and thou soud prevail whan thou contends.” But gin oor wrang maks Godʼs truth shine, what sal we say? Is God wrang wha punishes? — I am speakin as a man: Far frae it! Or hoo soud God judge the warld? But gin Godʼs truth appeared greater, to his glorie, by reason oʼ my leean, am I ony mair, as a sinner, to be condemned? And why no? Juist as some slander us, and report us as sayin, “Lat us do ill, that gude may come!” whase condemnation is richt. Weel, what than? Are we beildin oorsels? No the least! for we hae already chairged baith Jews and Greeks oʼ bein aneath sin; Eʼen as it is putten doon: “Thar is nane holie; na, no ane! “Thar is nane wyss; thar is nane seekin oot God. “They are aʼ gane a‐gley; they are aʼthegither feckless; thar is nane schawin love, no sae muckle as ane. “Their hauss is like an open sheugh; wiʼ their tongues they hae used doobleness; the venom oʼ the asp is aneath their lips. “Whase mouʼ is fuʼ oʼ bannin and bitternesss. “Glegg are their feet to spill blude; “Destroyin and sorrowin are iʼ their way‐gaun; “And a way‐gaun oʼ peace hae they nevir kent. “Nae fear oʼ God is afore their een.” Noo we ken that whatsoeʼer the Law says, it says it to thae that are aneath the Law; sae that ilka mouʼ may be stoppit, and the hail warld may come aneath the judgments oʼ God. Inasmuckle as by warks oʼ Law, sal nae flesh be made richtous in his sicht; for throwe the Law is the unveilin oʼ sin. But noo, aʼthegither sindry frae the Law, a richtousness oʼ God has been set forth, bein uphauden by the Law and the prophets; Eʼen a richtousness oʼ God throwe faith in Jesus Christ, comin to aʼ wha hae faith; for aʼ are ane; For aʼ hae sinned, and aʼ fail oʼ the glorie oʼ God; Bein held richtous, freely, throwe his ain favor, by the redeemin oʼ Christ Jesus: Wham God sut forth as oor coverin‐ower, by faith in his blude; for the settin forth oʼ his richtousness to the passin‐by oʼ oor auld sins, To schaw the gudeness oʼ God, in his tholin at this time; to the end he micht be richtous his sel, while declarin richtous the man wha believes in Jesus. Whaur comes in gloryin, than? It is putten awa! On whatna principle? Oʼ warks? Nay! But throwe the principle oʼ faith. We are reckonin, than, that a man is held richtous by faith, sindry frae the warks oʼ the Law. Or, is God the God oʼ Jews only? no oʼ the Nations as weel? Aye! eke oʼ the Nations! Gin at least he be the God, wha wull justify the circumceesion for their faith, and the uncircumceesion by like faith! Are we, than, makin the Law naething? No sae! On the contrar, we are makin siccar the Law. Whatna than sal we say that Abrʼam oor faither iʼ the flesh has gotten? For gin Abraʼm, by his warks, was acceptit as richtous, he had fundation for gloryin: yet no afore God. For what is putten doon iʼ the buik? “Abrʼam lippened God; and it was set doon as richtousness.” But to him wha works, the reward isna coontit by way oʼ favor, but by way oʼ debt. While to him wha works‐na, but lippens him wha justifies the ungodly — the faith oʼ him is coontit as richtousness. Eʼen as Dauvid schaws the weel?-?bein oʼ the man to wham God coonts richtousness, sindry frae warks: “Happy they whase ill‐deedinesses are forgiʼen, and whase sins are happit ower! “Happy is the man whase sin the Lord disna haud again him!” Comes than this blessin on the circumceesion? or on the uncircumceesion as weel? For we are sayin that “faith” was coontit to Abrʼam as “richtousness.” Hoo than was it coontit? Whan in circumceesion? or in uncircumceesion? No in circumceesion, but in uncircumceesion! And he was gien the sign oʼ circumceesion, a seal oʼ the faith?-?richtousness he had in his  uncircumceesion: sae that he micht be the great heid oʼ aʼ wha hae faith while in their uncircumceesion, that richtousness soud be coontit to them; And the great heid oʼ circumceesion to them wha not only hae circumceesion, but wha follow the steps oʼ oor faither Abrʼam in his uncircumceesion. For it wasna throwe the Law that the promise was gien to Abraʼm or to his seed, anent bein the heir oʼ the warld; but throwe the richtousness oʼ faith. For gin they wha are oʼ “Law” war heirs, “faith” has failed; and the promise has come to nocht! For the law schaws wrath; but whaur thar is nae law, thar is nae brekin oʼt. Sae it is oʼ faith, that it may be by favor, in order that the promise may be siccar till aʼ the seed: no to that oʼ the law only, but eke to that oʼ the Abrʼam‐faith, wha is the great heid oʼ us aʼ; (Eʼen as it is putten doon, “The great heid oʼ mony nations hae I made thee,”) afore God wham he believed: eʼen him wha raises the deid, and caʼs things that are‐na eʼen as gin they war: Wha, whan hope was gane, on hope held fast, that he micht become faither oʼ mony nations; eʼen as it was spoken, “Sae sal be thy seed!” And mainteenin strang his faith, he lookit‐na on his ain body as bein deid — bein eʼen aboot a hunner‐year‐auld — nor Sarahʼs womb as deid; But lookin on the promise oʼ God, he becam strang in faith, and switherʼt‐na wiʼ unbelief, giean glorie to God; And siccar iʼ the belief that what he had promised he was strang to perform: And sae it was coontit to him for richtousness. But it wasna for him alane that this was sae coontit to him; But eke for oor sakes, to wham it was to be coontit; to us wha pit oor faith in him wha raised Jesus oor Lord frae the deid; Wha was deliverʼt up for oor sins, and was raised again for oor justifyin. Bein than coontit richtous by faith, lat us hae peace in God, by oor Lord Jesus Christ; By wham is the introducin we hae had, by oor faith, intil this favor in whilk we staun: and lat us rejoice iʼ the hope oʼ Godʼs glorie. And no this alane, but eʼen rejoice in oor troubles; kennin that troubles work oot lang‐tholin; And lang‐tholin, testin; and testin, hope; And hope maks‐na ashamed; for that Godʼs love has been shed abreid in oor hearts throwe the Holie Spirit gien to us. For, we yet bein feckless, Christ in due season deeʼt for the ungodlie. Far jimply wad ony ane dee for an upricht man; yet aiblins for a holie man ane micht eʼen daur death; But God commends his ain love to us, in that eʼen while we war yet in sin, Christ deeʼt for us. Muckle mair, than, bein noo coontit richtous throwe his blude, we sal be savʼt frae the wrath throwe him. For gif, bein faes, we war reconcilʼt to God throwe his Sonʼs death, hoo muckle mair — bein noo reconcilʼt — sal we be savʼt in his life? And no only sae, but, rejoicin in God, throwe oor Lord Jesus Christ; throwe wham, at this present, we receive the reconciliation. For this reason — Juist as sin cam intil the warld throwe ae man, and throwe sin death; and sae to aʼ men death cam, for aʼ sinned: For to the Law, sin was iʼ the warld (but sin isna coontit up, gin thar war nae Law); But death had pooer frae Adam doon to Moses, eʼen ower thae wha hadna sinned  like to the sin oʼ Adam — wha is a likeness oʼ the Comin Ane. But no as the faut, was the gift oʼ the favor: for gin by the faut oʼ ane, mony deeʼt; mair was the favor oʼ God, and the free gift; the favor oʼ the ae man, Jesus Christ, was mair sufficinʼ for the mony. And no as throwe ane that sinned is the free gift. For the judgment was to condemnation on accoont oʼ ae faut; whauras the lovin‐favor is by mony fauts to justification. For gin throwe the faut oʼ ane, death had pooer throwe that ane — muckle mair they wha receive the unco plenitude oʼ the favor, and hae gien to them the free gift oʼ richtousness, sal hae pooer in life throwe Ane — Jesus Christ. And sae — as throwe the ae faut, condemnation cam on aʼ men, sae throwe ae richtousness establishʼt, the free gift comes to aʼ men. For eʼen as throwe the disobedience oʼ ae man, the mony war coontit as sinners — sae throwe the obedience oʼ ane sal the mony be coontit richtous. But Law cam in, that the offence micht be seen to exceed: but whaur offences exceedit, the tender‐love muckle mair exceedit. That, eʼen as sin had pooer, in death, sae tender‐love soud hae pooer, throwe richtousness, to Eternal Life, throwe Jesus Christ our Lord. What, than, are we to say? Are we to gang on in sin, that mair tender‐love may be seen? Awa wiʼ it! Hoo sal we, wha deeʼt to sin, be leevin ony langʼr inʼt? Ken‐ye‐na that aʼ we wha war bapteezʼt intil Jesus Christ, war bapteezʼt intil his death? We wiʼ him war buryʼt, than, in oor bapteezin intil his death; sae that eʼen as Christ was raised up frae ʼmang the deid by the glorious pooer oʼ the Faither, sae we in the new life micht walk! For, gin we hae been ane wiʼ him iʼ the image oʼ his death, nae doot sae sal we be iʼ the image oʼ his Risin‐again. Tak tent oʼ this, that oor auld man was wiʼ him crucifyʼt, sae that the body oʼ sin micht perish, that we soud serʼ sin nae mair. For he that has deeʼt, is quat oʼ sin. Noo, gin we deeʼt wiʼ Christ, we threep that we sal eʼen leeve wiʼ him; Kennin, that Christ, bein raised up frae the deid, dees nae mair: death has nae pooer ower him. For the death that he deeʼt, he deeʼt to sin  ance for aʼ; but noo that he leeves, he leeves to God. And sae you yersels coont yersels as deid to sin, but leevin to God, in Christ Jesus. Dinna lat sin, than, hae pooer iʼ yere deein body, to gar ye mind its craikin; Nor gie ower yere pooers, as instruments oʼ wickedness, to sin; but gie ower yersels to God, as gin leevin frae amang the deid; and yere pooers as instruments oʼ holiness to God. For sin sal nae mair hae pooer ower ye; for ye are‐na aneath the Law, but aneath Free‐Favor. And what than? Are we to sin, for that we are‐na aneath the Law, but aneath Free‐Favor? Far frae that! Div ye no ken, that to the ane ye are giean yersels ower to obey as servants, servants dae ye become to wham ye gie obedience: whether aiblins it be oʼ sin, to death; or obedience, to holiness. But thanks to God! that haein been Sinʼs servants, ye gied obedience oot oʼ the heart to yon form oʼ lear intil whilk ye war shapit; And, bein set free frae sin, ye war made into servants to Holiness. I speak but as a man, for the wauffness oʼ yer flesh; for eʼen as ye gied ower yere pooers as servants to vileness, and lawlessness for lawlessness — sae, noo, gie ower yere pooers as servants to Holiness, for yere perfection! For whan ye war Sinʼs servants, ye had naither airt nor pairt in holiness. What frute had ye than, iʼ yon things ye are noo ashamed oʼ? for the end oʼ sic is death! But noo, bein set free frae sin, and made servants to God, ye hae frute to sanctification; and at the lang‐last, Eternal Life! For the fee oʼ sin is death; but Godʼs gree is Eternal Life, in Jesus Christ, oor Lord! Ken‐ye‐na, brethren (for to sic as are leal to the Law am I speakin), that the Law has pooer ower a man for siccan a time as the lenth oʼ his life? For the wumman mairryʼt to a husband is bund by law as lang as he leeves; but gin aiblins the husband dee, she has fuʼ libertie frae the rule oʼ her husband. And sae, her husband leevin, gin she become anither manʼs, she wad be caʼd “adulteress”; but gin aiblins the husband dee, she is free frae the rule, sae as to be nae adulteress, eʼen thoʼ she become anither manʼs. Sae than, my brethren, ye too war brocht to death throwe the body oʼ Christ; to the end ye micht become anitherʼs — his wha was raised frae the deid; that we soud bring forth frute to God. For whan we war in the flesh, thae passions oʼ sin, excited by the Law, wrocht in oor pooers, to bring forth frute to death. But noo we are dischairged frae the Law, bein deid as to that by whilk we war hauden siccar; sae that we micht gie service in a new spirit, and no in the auld formality. What, than, are we to say? that the Law is sinfuʼ? Far frae it! On the contrar, I had neʼer taen tent oʼ sin, gin it warna by the Law. For I hadna ony thocht oʼ covetin, gin the Law hadna said, “Ye sanna covet!” But sin, makin an occasion, wrocht in me throwe the commandment aʼ mainner oʼ covetousness. For, sindry frae the Law, sin was deid. I mysel was leevin ance, sindry frae the Law. But the commandment cam, and sin lap to life, and I deeʼt. And the commaunʼ — that whilk was to be for life — I faund to be, for me, death! For sin, makin occasion oʼ the commaunʼ, clean deceivʼt me, and by it slew me. Sae that, on the ae haun, the Law is perfete; and the commandment holie, and just and gude. Weel, than, did the gude become death to me? Far frae it! On the ither haun, it was sin, that it soud kythe as sin throwe that whilk was gude, workin oot death in me; that by the commandment, sin soud be seen to be unco sinfuʼ. For we ken that the Law is spiritual; but I am but a creatur oʼ flesh; sellʼt as to a maister, Sin! For that whilk I am workin oot, I appruve‐na; for what I wiss‐na that I pursue; but what I hate, that dae I! Gin, than, I dae what I wadna, I own that the Law is richt. And noo, it isna I wha am workin it oot, but it is the sin that dwalls in me! For I ken thar dwalls‐na in me — that is in my flesh — ae gude thing. For the desirin lies nar to me, but the workin‐oot oʼ gude disna! For it isna the gude I wiss for I dae: but raither the ill I wadna do I practeese. But gin I dae that whilk I wadna, it is nae mair I wha am workin it oot, but the sin dwallin in me. And sae, I fin thar is a principle,  that whan I wad dae gude, the ill lies nar me! For in my benmaist heart I joy in the Law oʼ God; But I see anither principle in my bodily pooers, fechtin again the principle oʼ my mind; and takin me prisoner by the principle oʼ sin that is in my bodily pooers. A waesome man am I! Wha sal rescue me oot oʼ the body oʼ this death? Noo, God be thankit! And sae I mysel, wiʼ my mind, am in service to the Law oʼ God; while wiʼ the flesh I serʼ the principle oʼ sin. Sae than, thar is nae condemnation for thae that are in Christ Jesus. For the principle oʼ the Spirit oʼ Life in Christ Jesus deliverʼt me frae the principle oʼ sin and death. For, what coudna be by the Law — in that it was feckless throwe oor flesh — God condemned sin iʼ the flesh, in sendin his ain Son iʼ the image oʼ oor flesh, and because oʼ sin. That the holy ends oʼ the Law micht be seen in us, wha walk conform to the Spirit, and no conform to the flesh. For they wha leeve conform to the flesh, wad raither hae the things oʼ the flesh; but they followin the Spirit, wad hae the things oʼ the Spirit. Sae, what the flesh prefers is but death; but what the Spirit prefers, is indeed life and peace. For what the flesh prefers is at enmity wiʼ God; seein it disna gie itsel ower to Godʼs law — nor in fact, can it sae dae. And they wha hae their bein iʼ the flesh, canna pleasur God. But ye haena yere bein iʼ the flesh, but iʼ the Spirit, gin Godʼs Spirit is bidin in ye: but gin ony ane hasna Christʼs Spirit, he isna oʼ his. But, gin Christ is in ye, the body is deid on accoont oʼ sin, but the Spirit is leevin on accoont oʼ holiness. And gin the Spirit, wha raised up Jesus frae amang the deid, dwalls in ye, he that raised up Christ Jesus frae amang the deid sal eʼen gie life to yere deein bodies, on accoont oʼ his indwallin Spirit in ye. Sae than, brethren, debtors are we — no to the flesh, conform to the flesh to leeve — For, gin conform to the flesh ye are leevin, ye are sure to be deein; but, gin iʼ the Spirit ye are slayin the deeds oʼ the body, ye sal leeve. For as mony as are  airtit by Godʼs Spirit, they are Godʼs bairns. For ye hadna putten in ye a spirit oʼ slavery, bringin ye back intil dreid; but ye had putten intil ye a spirit oʼ adoption, in whilk we cryʼt oot, “Abba! Faither!” The Spirit himsel is joint witness wiʼ oor spirit, that we are bairns oʼ God. But, gin bairns — than heirs as weel! Godʼs heirs, and joint‐heirs wiʼ Christ; gin at least we jointly suffer, that we may be jointly glorifyʼt. For I coont that what we dree iʼ this present, is no wordie to be mentioned alang wiʼ the glorie to come, whilk is to be made kent throwe us. For the fain‐lookit‐forrit oʼ the Creation is waitin for the revealin oʼ Godʼs bairns. For to vanity was Creation made subject — no oʼ its ain wull, but by him wha made it subject — In hope that the Creation itsel soud be deliverʼt frae the slavery oʼ corruptness, intil the liberty oʼ the glorie oʼ the bairns oʼ God. For we ken that aʼ creation is maenin thegither, and travailin thegither, in bearin‐pangs till noo; And no only sae; but eʼen we, wha hae the first‐frute oʼ the Spirit, eʼen we oorsels, within oorsels are maenin, fain‐waitin for adoption — the redeemin oʼ oor body. For in hope we are savʼt; but hope beheld isna hope! for what ane sees, why dis he “hope” for? But gin what we see‐na we hope for, than patiently we wait, fain to hae it. And in that vera way, the Spirit is giean us help in oor weakness; for eʼen what we soud be prayin for iʼ the way we soud, we ken‐na; but the Spirit himsel helps oor intercessions, wiʼ fainness oʼ desire no to be utterʼt. And he wha redds oot the heart kens what the Spirit appruves, for it is conform to God he pleads, on behauf oʼ the saunts. But we div ken that to them wha love God, aʼ things work thegither for gude; to thae wha are bidden anes, conform to his purpose. For wham he afore appruved, he afore appointit, conform to the likeness oʼ his Son; that he micht be First‐born oʼ mony brethren. And wham he afore appointit, the same anes he bade; and wham war bidden, the same anes he appruved; and wham he appruved, the same he declarʼt richtous; and wham he declarʼt richtous, the same he made glorious. Than what sal we say to thir things? Gin God be on oor side, wha is again us? He wha hained‐na his ain Son, but gied him up for us aʼ, sal he no wiʼ the gift oʼ him, gie us aʼ things in his lovin favor? Wha sal wyte Godʼs chosen anes? God, wha declares them richtous? Wha condemns? Christ? wha deeʼt (na, wha raither was raised again), wha is at Godʼs richt haun, and pleadin in oor behauf? Wha sal sinder us frae Christʼs love? Sal trouble, or dool, or persecution, or famine, or nakitness, or skaith, or sword? Eʼen as it is putten doon, “For thy sake are we gien ower to death the hail day lang; we are coontit as sheep for the slauchter.” But, in aʼ thir things we are victorious — and mair nor victorious — by him wha loved us. For I am perswadit that no life, and no death, nor Angels, nor heigh pooers, Nor heigh things, nor laigh things, nor ony ither creatit thing, sal hae pooer to sinder us frae Godʼs love, whilk is in Christ Jesus oor Lord! The truth I say in Christ — I am‐na speakin fause — my conscience bein witnessin, alang wiʼ mysel in the Spirit, That thar is muckle dool to me, and constant sorrow iʼ my heart, For I mysel could hae wissʼt mysel  devotit by Christ, for my brethrenʼs sake, my kin eftir the flesh; Wha truly are Israelites; whase are the adoption, and glorie, and covenant, and law, and services, and promises; Whase are the patriarchs; and oʼ wham accordin to the flesh is the Christ; he wha is heigher than aʼ, God blessed for aye! But, no in sic mainner as thoʼ the promises oʼ God had failed. For no aʼ wha are oʼ Israʼl are truly Israʼl. Nor yet, gin they be a seed oʼ Abraʼm, are they aʼ bairns: but, “In Isaac sal thar be coontit thee a seed!” Thus: no the bairns oʼ the flesh are bairns oʼ God: but the bairns oʼ the promise are coontit as the seed. For this word is ane oʼ promise: “At this time sal I come, and thar sal be to Sarah a son.” And no only sae; but whan Rebecca had conceivʼt by ane, eʼen by oor faither Isaac — For they no bein yet born, nor had dune gude or bad, that the purpose oʼ God conform to choice soud remain; no oʼ warks, but oʼ him wha invitit — It was said to her, “The elder sal serʼ the younger.” Eʼen as it is putten doon, “Jaucob I loʼed; Esau I appruvʼd‐na.” What, than, sal we say? Is ony wrang‐doin wiʼ God? Far frae it! For to Moses he says. “I wull hae mercie on whamsoeʼer I can hae compassion!” Sae than, it is naither oʼ him that wad hae it, nor oʼ him that rins forʼt, but oʼ God wha gies mercie. For the Scriptur says to Pharaoh, “For this vera thing I raisʼt thee up, that I micht schaw in thee my pooer; sae as my name soud be kent in aʼ the yirth.” And sae, he  has mercie on wham he pleases, and wham he wull he gars harden. Ye may say to me, than, “Hoo, than, dis he wyte? for wha can staun again his wull?” Na, O man! wha are ye to be answerin God again? Sal the thing made say to him wha made it, “Why did thou mak me sae?” Or, hasna the potter a richt ower the clay, oot oʼ the same dadd to mak ae pot to honor, but anither to a want oʼ honor? What thoʼ God, desirin to schaw his angʼer, and to mak kent his pooer, tholed wiʼ unco patience the veschels oʼ wrath that had become fit for destruction? And that he micht mak kent his rich glorie on veschels oʼ mercie he had afore preparʼt for glorie; Wham he had bidden; eʼen us, no only frae amang Jews, but frae amang the nations as weel. Eʼen as he says by Hosea, “I wull caʼ her that wasna my folk ‘my folk!’ and her that wasna weel‐belovʼd, ‘my weel‐beloved.’ ” And, “It sal be, iʼ the place whaur it was said, ‘Ye are‐na my folk!’ eʼen thar sal they be caʼd, ‘Bairns oʼ the Leevin God!’ ” And Esaiah, too, cries oot aboot Israʼl, “Eʼen gin the number oʼ Israʼls bairns be as the sand oʼ the sea, a wheen left sal be saved; “For a perfete and close reckonin wull the Lord mak on the yirth.” Eʼen as Esaiah said afore, “Gin the Lord oʼ Hosts hadna left us a seed, we wad hae been as Sodom, and wad hae been like to Gomorrah.” What, than, are we to say? This: that the nations, thae wha warna cairryin on richtousness, nane‐the‐less laid haud oʼ a richtousness; a richtousness aʼ the same that it was by faith — Whilst Israʼl, thoʼ cairryin on a rule oʼ richtousness, didna win their way to that rule. And why? Juist this, that they war cairryin it on, no by faith, but as it war by warks. They stumblʼt at that stane oʼ stumblin; Eʼen as it is putten doon, “Behauld! I set in Zion a stane oʼ stumblin, and a rock oʼ offendin; and he wha lippens thar‐till sal no be putten to shame!” Brethren! the fain desire oʼ my heart, and its prayer to God on their behauf, is for their salvation! For I gie witness to them, that thay hae a zeal for God, but no conform to wisdom. For, no takin to them Godʼs richtousness — and aye seekin to up‐bigg their ain richtousness, they didna gie in to the richtousness oʼ God. For Christ is what the Law ettles  at, iʼ the way oʼ richtousness, to ilka ane wha has faith. For Moses has putten doon, anent the richtousness whilk is by the Law: “The man wha dis them sal leeve by them.” Whauras, the richtousness oʼ faith speaks like this: “Ye maun‐na say iʼ yere heart, ‘Wha sal speel up intil Heeven?’ ” (that is, for to fesh Christ doon;) “Or, ‘Wha sal lowt doon intil the abyss?’” (that is, for to raise up Christ frae amang the deid;) But what says it? “That whilk is spoken oʼ is nar‐haund ye; in yere mooth, and in yere heart”: that is, the thing oʼ the faith spoken oʼ; whilk thing we mak kent — That gin ye confess wiʼ yere mouʼ that Jesus is Lord, and hae faith iʼ yere heart that God raised him frae amang the deid, ye sal be saved. For in the heart ane has faith for richtousness, and the confession oʼ aneʼs mouʼ to salvation. For sae says the Scriptur, “Nane that trust in him sal be putten to shame.” For thar is nae differ atween Jews and Greeks; for the same Lord oʼ aʼ is bountifuʼ to aʼ that cry to him. For ilka ane — aʼ and every — wha may caʼ on the name oʼ the Lord sal be saved! Hoo than soud they caʼ on ane on wham they haena lippened? And hoo sal they lippen ane they haena heard‐tell oʼ? And hoo wull they hear, gin‐na some ane publishes? And hoo sal they publish, gin they warna sent oot? Eʼen as it is putten doon, “Hoo bonnie are the feet oʼ thae bringin us a Joyfu‐message o gude things!” But they didna aʼ meekly hear the Joyfuʼ‐message. For Esaiah says, “Lord! wha lippens what we proclaim?” And sae faith comes oot oʼ what is heard; and hearin comes by the word that is anent Christ. But say I, Did they no hear? Aye indeed! “Intil aʼ the yirth gaed their voice, and to the ends oʼ the inhabitit‐warld what they spak.” Again, say I, Didna Israʼl come to ken? First, quoʼ Moses, “I wull mak ye to be jealous ower a Nae‐Nation; and anent a glaikit nation wull I gar ye be angʼry.” But Esaiah is ventursome, and quoʼ he, “I was fund oʼ thae wha socht‐me‐na; I cam to be kent oʼ thae wha speirʼt‐na eftir me!” But anent Israʼl he says, “The hail day lang raxʼt I oot my hauns to a dour and thrawart‐speakin folk!” I speir than, Has God cuisʼen awa his folk? Far frae it! I mysel am an Israʼlite, oʼ Abraʼmʼs seed, oʼ Benjaminʼs tribe. God disna cast awa his folk he had afore appruvʼd. Wat ye na — anent Elijah — what the Scriptur says, as he pled wiʼ God again Israʼl? “Lord! thy prophets hae they slain; and thy altars hae they dung doon; and I am left allenar; and they seek for my life!” But what says the answer to him? “I hae keepit for mysel seeven thoosand men, wha hae‐na loutit a knee to Baal!” Sae than, eʼen at this present, thar is a wee wheen left, by way oʼ a favorin choice. But gin it be by favor, it is nae mair oʼ warks; else the favor isna favor. Weel, what? That whilk Isʼral socht eftir, the same they forgatherʼt?-?na wiʼ; but the chosen anes forgatherʼt wiʼt; whauras the lave war blearʼt, and saw na. Eʼen as it is putten doon: “God gae them a spirit that was sleeperie; een that they see‐na wiʼ, and lugs they hear‐na wiʼ, till this vera day.” And Dauvid says, “Be their buird a snare, and a girn, and a stumbling, and an ill‐return to them! “Be their een blearʼt, that they may‐na see; and their back be aye loutit doon!” But I say, Stumblʼt they to the end they micht faʼ? Far frae it! But throwe the ill‐daen oʼ them, salvation cam to the nations, to steer them up to be jealous. And noo, gin their ill‐daen was like muckle gear to the warld, and their loss like muckle gear to the nations — hoo muckle mair their abundance? But to you am I sayin this — you oʼ the nations; inasmuckle as I am an Apostle to the nations; my office I mak muckle oʼ. Gin, by ony means, I may steer up to be jealous my ain flesh, and save some frae ʼmang them. For, gin the castin‐awa oʼ them was a warldʼs bringin‐in, what sal the acceptin oʼ them be but like life frae the deid? And gin the first frute was holie, the book oʼt maun be holie as weel; and gin the rute was holie, eʼen sae the branches. And gin some oʼ the branches war taʼen awa — while ye (bein a wild olive) war graftit in amang them — and was made wiʼ them to share oʼ the rute — oʼ the fatness oʼ the olive — Haud‐na yere heid aboon the branches! But gin ye boast, ken that ye bear‐na the rute, but the rute you! Ye may say, “The branches war taen awa, that I micht be graftit in!” Weel! throwe their want oʼ faith they war broken; and ye by yere faith are staunin: look‐na at lofty things, but hae fear! For gin God spared‐na the nateral branches, tak tent that he spare‐na you! Gie tent, than, to Godʼs kindness and rigor; upon thae that fell, rigor; but upon you Godʼs kindness, gin aiblins ye bide aye in the kindness: else eʼen ye sal be cuttit oot. And eʼen they (except aiblins they still bide in their lack oʼ faith) sal be graftit in; for God can graft them in again. For gin ye war cuttit‐oot frae the nateral wild‐olive, and, ayont natur war graftit intil a gude olive! hoo muckle mair sal thir, the nateral branches, be graftit intil their ain olive tree! For I wadna hae ye no to ken this mystery, brethren, least ye be ower wyss in yere ain een, that a bleartness to a degree has come on Israʼl, till the abundance oʼ the nations sal come in: And sae, aʼ Israʼl sal be saved; eʼen as it is putten doon, “The Deliverer sal come oot oʼ Zion; he wull pit awa the ungodliness oʼ Jaucob! “And this is my covenant wiʼ them, iʼ the day that I tak awa their sins.” Anent the Joyfuʼ‐message, they are contrar tʼye; but as to the Choosʼn, they are weel looed for the faithersʼ sake. God never rues his biddin or his gifts! For eʼen as ye war at ae time dour toward God, but at this time hae gotten mercie by their dourness; Sae, thir war dour, that by yere mercie they too may win mercie. For God has coontit them aʼ dour, that he soud hae mercie on them aʼ. O, deepness oʼ Godʼs riches, and wisdom, and knowledge! hoo unfathomable his judgments! and his ways unsearchable! “For wha kent the Lordʼs mind? or wha becam his coonsellor?” Or wha first gied to him, and has it returned again? For, by him, and throwe him, and for him, are aʼ things! To him glorie for aye! Amen! I entreat ye, than, brethren, by the mercies oʼ God, that ye render yersels as a leevin, holie, weel‐pleasin offeran to God — a proper, rational service. And no to be conform to this warld, but to be transformed by the renewin oʼ yere mind, that ye may pit to the prufe what is Godʼs gude, and perfete, and acceptable wull. For, say I, by the favor gien to me, to ilka ane amang ye, no to be thinkin ower muckle oʼ his sel, ayont what he soud think oʼ his sel, but to think oʼ his sel discreetly; eʼen as God gied to ilka ane his portion oʼ faith. For, eʼen as in ae body we hae mony pairts, but aʼ oʼ the pairts hae?-?na the same duty, Sae we, the mony, are aʼ ae body in Christ; but allenarlie are pairts ane oʼ anither. Noo, haein gifts by favor, and gifts differan accordin to the favor gien to us — gin it be prophecie, lat it be iʼ the proportion oʼ faith; Or service, iʼ the service; or he that teaches, iʼ the teachin; Or an exhorter, iʼ the exhortin: he wha gies, lat him gie in aefauldness; he that leads, to lead tentilie; he that schaws mercie, to do it blythely. Love withoot hypocrisy, scunnerin at aʼ that is evil; haudin fast to aʼ that is gude. In britherly love schaw tender affection ane to anither; in giean honor, surpassin ane anither. In yere  actions no slothfuʼ; in yere spirit fervent; to the Lord fuʼ oʼ service; In hope rejoicin; in trouble lang‐tholin; in prayer perseverin; Wiʼ the needs oʼ saunts haein fellowship; in hospitality aye active. Gie blessins to persecutors — blessins, and no curses. Rejoice wiʼ the rejoicin, and greet wiʼ the tearfuʼ. Ilk ane to anither seek the same thing; no seekin heigh things, but forgatherin wiʼ lowly things. Be‐na wyss iʼ yere ain conceit. Return ill for ill to nane; provide things honorable afore aʼ men. Gin it be possible, as far as it lies in you, wiʼ aʼ men be at peace. No seekin vengeance, beloved; but gie place to angʼer; for it is putten doon, “To me belangs vengeance; I wull repay, says the Lord. “Gin yere enemy hungʼer, feed him; gin he be drouthie, gie him drink; for, sae doin, ye sal heap coals oʼ fire on his heid.” Be‐na owercome wiʼ ill; but owercome ye ill wiʼ gude. Lat ilka saul submit itsel to the protection oʼ the public authoritie. For thar is nae authoritie but by God; thae existin, exist by God. Sae he that sets his sel again the authoritie sets his sel again the ordinance oʼ God: and they that oppose sal receive condemnation. For rulers are‐na a fear to gude warks, but to the ill. But wad ye no be fleyʼt oʼ the authoritie? Dae ye that whilk is gude, and ye sal hae praise oʼ the same. For he is Godʼs servant tʼye, for that whilk is gude. But gin aiblins ye are doin ill, hae fear; for he disna cairry the sword for nocht. For Godʼs servant is he, punishin wiʼ wrath him wha practeeses ill. And sae thar is a need oʼ submittin yersels, no only on accoont oʼ the wrath, but eke on accoont oʼ conscience. For sae pey ye tribute as weel: for Godʼs ceevil servants are they, takin tent to this vera thing. Render, than, to aʼ their  dues; tribute to wham tribute; tax to wham tax; fear to wham fear; honor to wham honor. Awe nae man ocht, save love to ane anither; for he wha loʼes the ither fills up the Law. Thus: “Ye canna commit adultery; Ye sanna commit murder; Ye sanna steal; Ye sanna covet”; and gin thar be ony ither commandment, it is summed up iʼ this word, namely: “Ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yer sel!” Love to aneʼs neebor works nae ill; love tharfor, is the pith oʼ the Law. And, kennin the time, that it is an ʼoor eʼen noo for us to wauken oot oʼ sleep: for noo is oor salvation narer‐haun than whan we first believed: The nicht is far gane; the dawin comes on. Pit we awa, than, the warks oʼ darkness, and lat us tak the wapins oʼ licht! Lat us work, honorably, as in the licht oʼ day: no in bruilzies and druckenness, no in lewdness and wantonness, no in castins‐oot and envyin. But pit ye on the Lord Jesus Christ; and hae nae trokin wiʼ the flesh and its corrupt desires. And forby: ane that is weak iʼ the faith tak ye in, and no for the sake oʼ doots and disputes. Ane, indeed, in his faith can eat aʼ things; anither, wha is weak, eats what is vegetable. Lat‐na the eatin ane despise him that eats‐na; and lat‐na him that eats‐na condemn him that eats; for God receives him. Wha are ye that are judgin a fremʼd aneʼs servant? he sall staun or faʼ till his ain maister; but he sal be made to staun; for God is strang to up‐haud him. Ane, indeed, thinks mair oʼ ae day nor anither; whauras anither thinks muckle oʼ ilka day — lat ilk ane be well‐perswadit in his ain mind. He that regairds the day, regairds it to the Lord; and he that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gies thanks to God: and he that eats‐na, to the Lord he absteens, and gies thanks to God. For no ane oʼ us leeves to his ain sel; and no ane oʼ us dees to his ain sel. For baith, gin aiblins we leeve, we leeve to the Lord; and gin aiblins we dee, we dee to the Lord; sae than, gif we leeve, or gif we dee, we are the Lordʼs. For, ettlin thus, Christ baith deeʼt and raise again, that he micht hae the lordship ower the deid and the leevin. But ye, why soud ye condemn yere brither? Or ye, why soud ye lichtlie yere brither? For we sal aʼ present oorsels at Godʼs Judgment‐seat. For it is putten‐doon: “As I leeve, says the Lord, ‘To me sal lout ilka knee, and to God sal ilka tongue confess!’ ” And sae ilka ane oʼ us sal for himsel gie an account to God. Sae, nae mair lat us be judgin ane anither, but this discern ye raither — no to pit a stumblin‐clog afore yere brither; or a girn. I ken, and hae become perswadit by the Lord Jesus, that  naething is unclean oʼ itsel; only till him wha is reckonin onything to be unclean, till him it bude be unclean. Noo, gif ower your meat yere brither is grieved — nae mair are ye gangin in love — dinna wiʼ yere eatin destroy that ane for wham Christ deeʼt! Lat na yere gude be ill‐spoken oʼ. For Godʼs kingdom isna eatin and drinkin, but holiness and peace, and rejoicin in Holie Spirit. For ane that is sae doin service to Christ, is weel‐pleasin to God, and acceptit oʼ men. The things oʼ peace, than, are we pursuin; and the things that are for oor common up‐biggin. For the sake oʼ meat, be‐na undoin Godʼs wark. Aʼ things, indeed, are clean; but it is ill for the man wha eats wiʼ cause oʼ stumblin. It is a grand thing no to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do onything whaurin yere brither is gart to stumble, or is snared, or is made feckless. And ye, what faith ye hae, hae it to yersel afore God! Weel is he wha condemns‐na his ain sel in what he appruves. But he that maks a distinction atween meats is condemned gif he eat, for it wasna oʼ faith; for what isna oʼ faith is sin. We that are strang soud be cairrying the burdens oʼ thae that are‐na strang, and no be pleasin oorsels: But ilk ane pleasur his neebor in that whilk is gude, wiʼ a view to his strenthenin. For eʼen Christ pleased‐na himsel; but as it is putten doon, “The ill‐words oʼ thae that ill‐caʼd thee fell on me!” For as mony things as war putten doon afore‐haun, war putten doon for oor lear, that throwe tholin and the consolation oʼ the Scripturs we soud hae hope. Noo the God oʼ aʼ tholin and consolation gie ye to tak tent to the same thing ane wiʼ anither, accordin to Jesus Christ. Sae that, wiʼ ae mind, and ae voice, ye may be magnifyin the God and Faither oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ. And sae help ye ane anither, eʼen as Christ helpit you, to Godʼs glorie. For I threep that Christ becam a servant oʼ circumceesion, in behauf oʼ the truth oʼ God, that he micht mak siccar the promises gien to the faithers. That the nations, on the ither haun, micht magnify God for his mercie; eʼen as it is putten doon: “For this cause wull I confess to thee amang the nations; and to thy name wull I sing psalms.” And again he says: “Be joyfuʼ, ye nations, wiʼ his folk!” And ance mair: “Gie ye praise, aʼ ye nations, to the Lord! and dwall on his praises, aʼ ye folk!” And again, Esaiah says, “A rute sal thar be oʼ Jesse; and he wha is risin to rule the nations: on him sal the nations hope.” Noo the God oʼ hope fill ye wiʼ aʼ joy and peace in believin, to the end ye may hae rowth oʼ hope, and pooer oʼ the Holie Spirit. And I mysel, my brethren, am become perswadit oʼ ye, that ye yersels are filled wiʼ gudeness, fuʼ oʼ aʼ knowledge, and fit to coonsel ane anither. Nane‐the‐less, I wrate the mair bauldly in pairt to ye, steerin up yere memories, because oʼ the favor oʼ God gien to me. To the end I soud be a public servant oʼ Jesus Christ to the nations, giean service in the Joyfuʼ‐message oʼ God, that the offeran oʼ the nations micht be weel‐pleasin, made holie by the Holie Spirit. I hae, than, the roosin oʼ mysel in Christ Jesus, as to the things oʼ God; For I winna daur to speak oʼ deeds whilk Christ wrocht‐na oot for himsel by me, to the obeyin oʼ the nations, in word and deed: In rowth aʼ signs and ferlies, in pooer oʼ the Holy Spirit, sae that I frae Jerusalem and in a great sweep the lenth oʼ Illyricum, hae deliverʼt fully the Joyfuʼ‐message oʼ Christ. But in sic mainner am I strivin to preach the Joyfuʼ‐message — no whaur Christʼs name was kent; that I bigg‐na on anitherʼs foundation; But, eʼen as it is putten doon: “They that warna tellʼt aboot him sal see; and they wha hae‐na heard sal understaun.” For whilk thing I was, a gey wheen times, hinderʼt frae coming to ye; But noo, haein nae mair place in thir pairts, and haein a strang desirin a gude wheen year to see ye, Whaneʼer I micht be gaun intil  Spain, I am in hope, whan gaun throwe, to see ye, and by you to be sutten forrit on the way, gin aiblins wiʼ you first I am in pairt satisfeeʼt. But e‐noo I am gaun to Jerusalem, to serʼ the saunts. For Macedonia and Achaia war weel‐pleased to mak a certain gift for the poortith oʼ the saunts at Jerusalem. They war sae pleased — and their debtors are they. For, gin in their spiritual things the Gentiles had a share — they soud iʼ their temporal things share wiʼ them. Haein than completit this, and haein made siccar to them this frute, I wull come back, by you, to Spain. I ken too, that whan I dae come, I sal come iʼ the abundance oʼ the blessin oʼ Christ. But I entreat ye, brethren, throwe oor Lord Jesus Christ, and the love oʼ the Spirit, to warsle thegither wiʼ me, in prayers for me, to God; That I may be rescued frae the unbelievin in Judea; and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saunts: And that joyfully I may come tʼye, throwe Godʼs wull, and may be refreshed wiʼ you aʼ. Noo the God oʼ aʼ peace be wʼye aʼ. Amen! Forby, I commend tʼye Phebe oor sister, as bein ane that serʼs the kirk in Cenchrea, That ye may gie her a welcome iʼ the Lord, wordie oʼ saunts, and may uphaud her whaur she may hae need oʼ ye; for eʼen she hersel up?-?haudit mony, and me mysel. Salute  ye Prisca and Aquila, my marrows in Christ Jesus; Wha for my life offerʼt their ain necks; to wham no only I gie praise, but aʼ the kirks oʼ the Gentiles. And salute the gaitherin iʼ their hoose. Salute Epanetus, my dear ane, wha is first frute oʼ the Province oʼ Achaia to Christ. Salute Mary, wha wrocht muckle for us. Salute Andronicus, and Junias, my kin, and my fellow‐captives, wha are notit amang the Apostles; wha indeed war in Christ suner than myselʼ. Salute Ampliatus, a dear ane in the Lord. Salute Urban, oor comrade in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. Salute Apelles, ane appruvʼd oʼ Christ. Salute thae oʼ Aristobulusʼ family. Salute Herodian, my kinsman. Salute thae oʼ the family oʼ Narcissus, that are in the Lord. Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, wha toil in the Lord. Salute Persis, the weel‐loved ane, wha indeed toiled muckle in the Lord. Salute Rufus, chosen oʼ the Lord, and his (and my) mither. Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren wiʼ them. Salute Philologus and Julias, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and aʼ the saunts wiʼ them. Salute ane anither wiʼ a sacred kiss. Aʼ the kirks oʼ Christ salute you. But I entreat ye, brethren, to tak tent oʼ thae that mak the diveesions and offences, contrar to the lear ye war learned, and turn awa frae them. For sic as thir ser‐na our Lord Jesus Christ, but their ain wame; and, by their fleechin words and flatterin speeches, deceive simple aefauld hearts. For yere obedience has come to be kent oʼ aʼ; ower you, than, I rejoice; but I wad hae ye to be wyss to that whilk is gude, and innocent oʼ that whilk is ill. But the God oʼ peace sal ding Sautan aneath yere feet sune! The tender‐love oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ be wʼye! Timothy, my marrow, salutes ye, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen. I, Tertius, wha penned this Epistle, salute ye iʼ the Lord. Gaius, the enterteener oʼ mysel and oʼ the hail kirk, salutes ye. Erastus the City Treasurer salutes ye; and Quartus oor brither. The kindly love oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ wiʼ ye aʼ! Amen! Noo to him wha has pooer to dar ye siccarlie staun, conform to my Joyfuʼ‐message, eʼen the preachin oʼ Jesus Christ, accordin to the revealin oʼ the mystery, in by‐gane ages keepit close, But is make kent e‐noo, throwe the prophecies oʼ the Scripturs, conform to the wull oʼ the everlastin God, until obedience oʼ faith, to aʼ the nations made plain, To the only wyss God, throwe Jesus Christ — to him be glory, for ever mair! Amen. Paul, caʼd as an Apostle oʼ Jesus Christ, by the wull oʼ God; and the brither Sosthenes; To the Kirk oʼ God, sanctifyʼt in Christ Jesus, whilk is in Corinth, caʼd as saunts; wiʼ aʼ that caʼ on the name oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ in aʼ places, their Lord and oors; Tender love be to ye, and peace, frae God oor Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I am thankin my God aye, anent ye, for the favor oʼ God gien to ye in Christ Jesus, That in aʼ things ye had rowth in him, in aʼ word and knowledge, Eʼen as the  testimonie oʼ Christ was made siccar amang ye. Sae that ye faʼ ahint in nae gift oʼ grace; fain‐waitin for the revealin oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ; Wha sal eʼen mak ye siccar throwe aʼ, unblameable iʼ the day oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ. Leal and faithfuʼ is God, by wham ye war caʼd intil a ane‐ness wiʼ his Son Jesus Christ oor Lord. But I entreat ye, brethren, by the name oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, that ye aʼ speak as ane, and that thar be‐na amang ye diveesions; but raither that ye be perfetely joined thegither iʼ the same mind, and the like conclusions. For it has been signifyʼt to me, anent ye, my brethren, by thae oʼ Chloe, that strifes are amang ye. But this, say I, that ilk ane oʼ ye says, “I am oʼ Paul;” and “I am oʼ Apollos;” and “I oʼ Peter;” and “I oʼ Christ.” Has Christ been sinderʼt? Was Paul crucifyʼt in yere behauf? Or intil Paulʼs name war ye bapteezʼt? I gie thanks to God that nane oʼ ye I bapteezʼt, gin it warna Crispus and Gaius; That nane micht say I bapteezʼt in my ain name. Howbeit, I bapteezʼt too the family oʼ Stephanas: mair nor thir I kenna whether I bapteezʼt ony. For Christ sent‐me‐na to bapteeze, but to gie oot the Joyfuʼ‐message; no in wisdom oʼ speech, least the cross oʼ Christ soud be made less oʼ. For the message oʼ the cross is but havers to thae wha perish: hoobeit, to thae wha are rescued, eʼen to us, it is the pooer oʼ God. For it is putten doon: “I destroy the wisdom oʼ the wyss anes, and set aside the discernment oʼ the discernin anes.” Whaur is a wyss ane? Whaur a writer? Whaur a disputer oʼ this warld? Has‐na God made the wisdom oʼ the warld witlessness? For, seein that iʼ the wisdom oʼ the warld, the warld kent‐na God throwe its wisdom, it was Godʼs gude pleasur, throwe the witlessness oʼ preachin, to save them that hae faith. For baith Jews for ferlies are speirin, and Greeks for wisdom are seekin: Whauras we proclaim a Messiah wha has been crucifyʼt; to the Jews, indeed, a stumblin‐clog; but to the Greeks folly; Nane‐the‐less, to the bidden anes theirsels, baith Jews and Greeks, a Messiah; the pooer oʼ God, and the wisdom oʼ God. For the “folly” oʼ God is wysser nor men; and the “weakness” oʼ God michtier nor men. For look at yere bidden, brethren; that no mony wyse accordin to the flesh, no mony oʼ pooer, no mony heigh anes war chosen; On the contrar, God chose the witless things oʼ the warld, that he soud shame thae that are wyss; and the weak things oʼ the warld God waled, to shame the things that are michty; And the laigh things oʼ the warld, and the geckʼt‐at things God waled — things no existin — that existin things micht be brocht to nocht. Sae as nae flesh soud boast in Godʼs presence. But oʼ him are ye in Christ Jesus, wha has made wisdom frae God to us, and richtousness, and santification, and redemption: Sae, as it is putten‐doon, “He that boasts, lat him boast iʼ the Lord.” And I, whan I cam to ye, brethren, cam‐na iʼ the way oʼ speech or wisdom that excelled, bringin to ye Godʼs testimonie. For I set doon my fit to ken naething amang ye, but Jesus Christ, and him as ane that had been crucifyʼt. And I cam, in fecklessness and shrinking, and wiʼ muckle fear, to be wiʼ ye; And my speech and my message warna wiʼ wheedlin words oʼ the wyss, but in demonstration oʼ spirit and pooer. Sae that yere faith need‐na staun in menʼs wisdom, but in Godʼs pooer. Wisdom, nane‐the‐less, we speak — amang experienced anes: wisdom hoobeit, no oʼ this warld, nor oʼ the great men oʼ this warld — wha are to be aʼ putten‐by; But we speak Godʼs wisdom in a riddle, the knowledge that had been keepit hidlins, whilk God designed aforehaun, afore aʼ time, for oor glorie, That no ane oʼ the great anes oʼ this warld has come to ken; for had they come to ken, they wadna iʼ that case hae crucifyʼt the Lord oʼ Glorie! But, eʼen as it is putten doon, “What‐na things the ee  saw‐na, and the ear heard‐na, and manʼs heart conceivʼt‐na — sae mony things has God prepared for thae that loʼe him!” To us, nane‐the‐less, has God revealʼt them, by the Spirit; for the spirit kens aʼ things, eʼen the deep things oʼ God. For wha oʼ men kens manʼs things, but manʼs spirit that is in him? Sae, nane kens the things oʼ God, but Godʼs Spirit. But we gat, no the warldʼs spirit, but the Spirit that is oʼ God, sae as we soud ken the things God gies to us by his favor; Whilk things eke we speak, no in man‐taught words oʼ lear; but in words spirit‐taught to spiritual men, spiritual things exponin. But a man oʼ flesh taks‐na in the things oʼ Godʼs Spirit; for they are daftness to him, and he canna get to ken them, for that they are to be spiritually redd oot. But the spiritual man speirs oot aʼ things; but he his sel is speirʼt oot by nane. For wha cam to ken the Lordʼs mind, that he micht gie him lear? But we haʼe Christʼs mind. And I, brethren, could only speak to ye as men oʼ flesh, as bairns in Christ; and no as to spiritual men. Wiʼ milk I fed ye, and no wiʼ meat; for ye war‐na yet able forʼt: nay! eʼen yet ye are‐na able! For ye are yet fleshly; for whaur thar are amang ye jealousy and strife, are‐ye‐na fleshly, and gaun‐on as men? For whan ane says, “I, in sooth, am oʼ Paul!” but anither, “I am oʼ Apollos!” are ye no fleshly men? Wha, than, is Apollos? and wha is Paul? Juist servants, throwe wham ye believʼt: eʼen as the Maister gied to ilk ane. I plantit, Apollos watirʼt; but God maks to growe. Sae, than, naither he that plants is onything, nor he that watirs, but God that maks to growe. And he that plants, and he that watirs, are baith ane: hoobeit, ilk ane sal hae his ain reward, eʼen as his labour sal be. For we are Godʼs fellow‐workers; and ye are Godʼs mailin, Godʼs biggin. Eʼen as the favor oʼ God was gien me, as a wyss biggin‐maister I lay a fundation, and anither biggs onʼt. But lat ilk ane tak tent hoo he biggs tharon! For ocht ither fundation nane can lay but that whilk is laid, that is Jesus Christ. But gin ony ane is up‐biggin on the fundation, wiʼ gowd, siller, precious gems, wud, gerss, stibble — Ilk aneʼs wark wull be made plain; for the day wull set it forth: and the lowe wull try ilk aneʼs wark, oʼ whatna sort it is. Gin ony aneʼs wark whilk he has biggit tharon stauns, he sal hae his meed: Gin ony aneʼs wark sal be brunt up, he sal  hae skaith; hoobeit, he his sel sal be savʼt; yet as throwe the fire. Ken‐ye‐na that ye are a temple oʼ God, and Godʼs Spirit is dwallin in ye? Gin ony man destroy Godʼs temple, him wull God  destroy; for the temple oʼ God is holie; whilk in sooth are ye. Lat nae ane delude his sel: gin ony ane thinks he is wyss amang ye iʼ this warld, lat him become witless, in order that he may become wyss. For the wisdom oʼ this warld is daftness wiʼ God. For it is putten‐doon, “He snares the wyss wiʼ their ain pawkiness.” And ance mair: “The Lord taks tent oʼ the reasonins oʼ the wyss, that they are havers.” Sae, lat nane boast oʼ men; for aʼ things are yere ain, Gin aiblins it be Paul, or Apollos, or Peter, or the warld, or life, or death, or things wiʼ us, or things to be — aʼ are yere ain; But ye are Christʼs: but Christ is Godʼs. Sae lat a man pit us doon as actin for Christ; as awmoners oʼ Godʼs secret things. And here, too, it is necessar that awmoners be fund honest. But wiʼ me, it is a smaʼ thing that I soud be judged by you, or on  manʼs day; aye! I am‐na eʼen judgin mysel. For I ken nocht to wyte mysel wiʼ; but this disna mak me richtous. But he wha judges me is the Lord. And sae, judge nocht ower?-?sune, till the time the Lord comes, wha wull baith mak plain the hidlin things oʼ the mirkness, and wull schaw the thochts oʼ the hearts: and than, ilk aneʼs commendin sal come frae God. But thir things, brethren, I hae (sae to speak), taen to mysel and Apollos, for yere sakes; sae as in us ye micht learn the lear, no to gang ayont what is putten‐doon: that ye soudna be swallin yersels up, ilk ane again anither. For wha maks a differ atween ye? And what hae ye that ye didna receive? Noo, gin ye received it, why soud ye swall up yersel as gin ye didna receive it? Eʼen noo hae ye become stawʼd; eʼen noo hae ye become rich: allenarlie, and sindry frae us, ye hae gotten to be kings! and I wad ye war kings, that eʼen we micht reign alang wʼye. For sae it seems to me; God has set forth us, the Apostles hinmaist; as gien ower to the deid: for a spectacle are we made to the warld — to Angels and to men. We are made fules for the name oʼ Christ: but ye are wyss in Christ: we are feckless, but ye are strang: ye are honored, but we dishonored. Eʼen to this ʼoor, we hae hungʼer, and drooth, and nakitness; are clourʼd, and cuisten‐oot; We toil, workin wiʼ oor ain hauns; whan miscaʼd, we bless; whan persecutit, we thole it. Whan defamed, we entreat; we are made as the midden‐heap oʼ the warld; the dightins and orts oʼ aʼ things, eʼen to this day. No to shame ye dae I say thir things; on the contrar, I admonish ye as my weel‐loʼed bairns. For it may be that ye hae ten thoosand teachers in Christ, yet surely no mony faithers — for in Christ Jesus I becam yere faither iʼ the Joyfuʼ‐message. I entreat ye, than, that ye be as I am. For this reason, I send to ye Timothy, wha is my bairn, belovʼd, and faithfuʼ iʼ the Lord; wha wull gar ye to caʼ to mind my ways whilk are in Christ, eʼen as I teach, in aʼ places, in ilka kirk. But some are swalled‐up, as gin I warna comin to ye. But I wull come tʼye, sune; gin it please the Lord; and I sal get to ken — no the words oʼ thae that are swalled‐up — but the pooer. For the Kingdom oʼ God isna in words, but in pooer! Whatna oʼ them wad ye hae? Soud I come tʼye wiʼ a rod? or in love and the spirit oʼ meekness? It is the common clash that thar is uncleanness amang ye; and sic uncleanness as is no eʼen to be heard oʼ amang the nations; that ane soud hae his faitherʼs wife. And ye hae been swalled‐up, and didna raither lament, that he micht be taen oot oʼ the mids oʼ ye, wha did sic wark. For I, absent in body, but present in spirit, hae gien judgment, as gin I war present, on him that has dune this thing. Iʼ the name oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, ye bein forgatherʼt — and my spirit — wiʼ the pooer oʼ the Lord Jesus Christ, That ye gie ower siccan a ane  to Sautan, for the destroyin oʼ the flesh, that the spirit may be savʼt iʼ the day oʼ the Lord Jesus. Yere roosin oʼ yersels is unseemly. Ken‐ye‐na, that a wee barm wull leaven the hail melder. Pit awa, than, the auld leaven, that ye may be a new lump, accordin as ye are unleavened; for oor Paschal?-?Lamb has been slain: Christ. Lat us than keep festival, no wiʼ auld leaven, naither wiʼ leaven oʼ vice and wickedness, but wiʼ the unleavenʼd breid oʼ aefauldness and truth! I wrate to ye in my epistle, no to be nar‐freends wiʼ unclean anes; Yet no avoidin aʼ‐thegither the unclean anes oʼ this warld; or the covetous, or extortioners, or eidol‐lovers; for than ye bude gang oot oʼ the warld: But noo I send tʼye, no to be makin nar‐freends, gin ony ane caʼd a brither be unclean, or covetous, or an eidol‐lover, or a mis‐caʼer, or drucken, or an extortioner: wiʼ siccan a ane no eʼen to eat. For what hae I wiʼ judgin thae oot‐by? Isʼt no for ye to judge thae within? But thae oot‐by disna God judge? Sae pit oot the ill‐deedie man frae amang yersels. Daur ony oʼ ye, haein a plea wiʼ his neebor, gang to the coort afore the unrichtous, and no gang afore the saunts? Or ken‐ye‐na that the saunts sal judge the warld? And gin by you the warld is judged, are ye unfit for the smaʼest tribunal? Ken‐ye‐na that we sal judge Angels? hoo muckle mair, than, things oʼ this life? Gin than, ye hae to judge things oʼ this life, wad ye hae thae to judge that ye esteem‐na iʼ the kirk? I speak this to shame you. Sae! is it possible thar isna amang ye a discernin man, ane fit to gie a judgment atween his brethren? But brither has a plea wiʼ brither, and that afore unbelievers! Nay, eʼen noo are ye  cuisten in yere plea! to hae law‐pleas ane wiʼ anither. Why div‐ye‐na raither tak wrang? Why div‐ye‐na raither thole defraudin? Nay, but eʼen ye yersels do wrang, and defraud; and that yere ain brethren! Ken‐ye‐na that the ill‐deedie sanna come intil Godʼs Kingdom? Dinna be misleared; naither unclean, nor eidol‐lovers, nor adulterers, nor miscaʼers, nor Sodomites, Nor thieves, nor sellie, nor the drucken, nor thae that curse, nor extortioners, sal come to possess the Kingdom oʼ God. And sic war some oʼ ye; but ye had them weshed awa, but ye war made pure, but ye war declarʼt richtous — iʼ the name oʼ the Lord Jesus Christ, and iʼ the Spirit oʼ oor God. Aʼ things are allooʼt to me but aʼ things wadna profit me; aʼ things are allooʼt to me, but I winna be behauden to ony. Meats for the stammack, and the stammack for meats; but God wull bring to nocht baith it and them. The body isna for uncleanness, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. God baith raised‐again the Lord; and wull raise us throwe his pooer. Ken‐ye‐na that aʼ yere pairts are pairts oʼ Christ? Takin than the pairts oʼ Christ, sal I mak them the pairts oʼ a harlot? Or ken‐ye‐na that he that joins his sel to a harlot is ae body? (“For,” says he, “the twa sal be ae flesh.”) But he that joins his sel to the Lord is ae spirit. Flee frae uncleanness! Ilka sin that a man may do is unco to his body; whauras, he wha commits uncleanness feshes sin intil his ain body. Or ken‐ye‐na that yere body is a temple oʼ the Holie Spirit within ye, that ye hae frae God? and that ye war‐na yere ain? In vera deed, ye war coft wiʼ a price; sae, magnify God in yere body. But, anent what ye wrate to me: It is gude for a man no to be bund to a wumman. Yet, because oʼ uncleanness, lat ilk man hae his ain wife, and ilk wumman her ain man. Lat the husband render to the wife what is due; and in siclike mainner, the wife as weel, to the husband. The wife hasna authoritie ower her ain body, but the husband; and in siclike mainner the husband hasna authoritie ower his ain body, but the wife. Defraud‐ye‐na ane the ither, unless aiblins it may be for a wee, by consent, that ye may hae mair time for prayer: and forgather again, lest Sautin tempt ye wiʼ incontinence. This, hoobeit, I am saying by permission, and no oʼ commandment. I coud wuss a man to be like mysel; but ilka ane has his ain gift frae God; ane this, and anither that. Nane‐the‐less, say I to the unmarryʼt and to weedows: Weel for them gin aiblins they bide eʼen as I am. But, gin they haena continency, lat them mairry: for better isʼt to mairry than to be ower fain. To the mairryʼt hoobeit, I gie chairge — yet no I, but the Lord — that a wife gang‐na awa frae her husband. But gin aiblins she eʼen be sinderʼt, lat her bide unmairryʼt, or else be reconcilʼt to her husband; and lat‐na a husband pit awa a wife. And to the lave say I (no the Lord), Gin a brither hae a wife, and she believes‐na, and gin she hersel is weel‐pleased to dwell wiʼ him — lat him no send her awa. And a wife wha has a husband that believes‐na, gin he his sel is weel‐pleased to dwall wiʼ her — lat her no lea her husband! For the misbelievin husband is sanctifyʼt in the wife, and the misbelievin wife is sanctifyʼt in the husband: itherways, as the case is, yere  bairns war unclean; but noo are they holie. Hoobeit, gin the misbelievin husband is unyoking his sel, lat him be unyokin his sel! the brither or the sister hasna come into bondage in sic like: but God has enjoined upon us peace. For hoo ken ye, O wife! but ye may save yere husband? Or hoo ken ye, O husband! but you may save yere wife? But whether sae, ilk ane, as the Lord has portioned oot to him, ilk ane as God has fund him and caʼd him, sae lat him be walkin; and sae enjoin I in aʼ the kirks. Haein been circumceesed whan ane was caʼd, lat him no be uncircumceesed. In uncircumceesion was ony ane caʼd? Lat him no become circumceesed! Circumcession is naething, and uncircumceesion is naething: but the keepin oʼ Godʼs commandments is aʼ?-?thing. Ilk ane, in the mainner oʼ life in whilk he was caʼd, sae abide. A thirlman war ye whan caʼd? Lat it no fash ye! but gin ye hae choice to be free, tak it. For he that in the Lord was caʼd, whan a thirlman, is emancipate iʼ the Lord; in siclike, he wha was caʼd as a free man, is a bondman in the Lord. Ye war coft wiʼ a price: become‐na servants oʼ men. Lat ilk ane, in that state in whilk he was caʼd, abide wiʼ God. But, anent thae that are maidens, I hae nae commauns oʼ the Lord; but I gie ye my mind, as ane that has had mercie frae the Lord to be true and leal. This than, I wad say is seemlie iʼ the case, by stress of existin things, that it is weel for a man sae to be. Hae ye become bund to a wife? Seek‐na to be lowsed. Are ye lowsed frae a wife? Seek‐na a wife. But gin ye eʼen mairry, ye hae?-?na sinned: and gin a maiden mairry, she hasna sinned. Nane‐the‐less, sic wull hae tossins‐aboot iʼ the flesh. But I spare ye. But eʼen this say I, brethren; the time is wearin dune; lat them wiʼ wives be as gin they had nane; And them greetin, as gin they grat‐na; and them rejoicin, as gin they rejoiced‐na; and them buyin, as gin they obteenʼd‐na; And them usin the warld, as no bund‐up inʼt; for the form oʼ this warld is passin awa. Moreover, I wad ye war free frae carkin care. The man no mairryʼt is tentie aboot the Lordʼs things, hoo he may pleasur the Lord; Whauras, the man mairryʼt, is tentie aboot his wifeʼs maitters, hoo he may pleasur his wife, and sae is dividit. And thar is a differ atween a wife and a maiden: she that is no mairryʼt, is tentie aboot the Lordʼs things, sae as she may be holie in body and spirit; whaur‐as she that is mairryʼt is tentie anent the warldʼs things, hoo she may pleasur her husband. This speak I, wiʼ an ee to yere ain gude; no that I wad cast a snare ower ye; but wiʼ an ee to what is seemly, and that ye may wait on the Lord untrammlʼt. But gin ony man thinks he disna weel by his maiden, gin she pass the flooer oʼ her age, and need be, lat him do as he wad; he isna committin sin; lat them wed. Nane‐the‐less, he that stauns siccar in his heart, no bein under necessity, but has pooer as anent his ain wull; and has made it up in his ain heart to keep his maiden, dis weel. Sae, baith he wha gies in mairriage his ain maiden dochter dis weel; and he wha disna gie in mairriage dis eʼen better. A wife is bund as lang as her husband leeves; but gin aiblins her husband is faun asleep, she is free to mairry wham she wull: only in the Lord. But happier, gin she thus abide, in my judgment; and mair, I think I hae the Spirit oʼ God. Noo, anent eidol‐sacrifeeces: “We ken that we aʼ hae knowledge.” Knowledge swalls up, but love up‐biggs. Gif ony man thinks he kens a thing, he hasna yet gotten to ken onything as he soud ken. But, gif ony man loeʼs God, the same man is appruvʼt oʼ God. Anent eidol‐sacrifeeces:— we ken weel that an eidol is naething iʼ the warld, and that thar is nae God but ane. For eʼen gin thar be sae‐caʼd gods, gin they be in heeven or yirth — eʼen as thar are “gods” mony and “lords” mony; But to us thar is ae God, the Faither, by wham are aʼ things, and we for him; and ae Lord Jesus Christ throwe wham are aʼ things, and we throwe him. Hoobeit, that lear is no in aʼ; but some, trokin  wiʼ the eidol, eʼen till noo, wiʼ the eidol as a sacrifeece, eat; and their conscience, bein unco waff, is defiled. But meat will‐na gar us win ben to God; naither, gin aiblins we eat‐na, div we faʼ short; nor aiblins gin we eat, div we excel. But tak ye tent, that by nae means this freedom is made a stumbling clog for the weak. For gin aiblins ane soud see you, wha has knowledge, sittin in an eidolʼs temple, at meat, wull‐na his weak conscience be made bauld to eat the eidol‐sacrifeeces? Sae, than, the weak ane — the brither Christ deeʼt for — is brocht to ruin by yere knowledge! But in sae sinnin again the brethren, and clouring their conscience whilk is weak, ye are sinnin again Christ! Sae, in ony case ava, whaur meat is a snare to my brither, Iʼse in naewise eat flesh for evermair, that I mak‐na my brither to stoiter. Walk I no at liberty? Am I no an Apostle? Hae I no seen Jesus Christ oor Lord? Are ye no yersels my wark iʼ the Lord? Gin to ither anes I am‐na an Apostle, yet nae doot I am to you: for the seal oʼ my apostleship are ye iʼ the Lord! My defence to thae wha quaisten me is this: Hae‐we‐na richt to eat and drink? Hae‐we‐na richt to be leadin aboot a wife wha is a believer, as weel as the lave oʼ the Apostles, and the Lordʼs brethren, and Peter? Or hae only I and Barnabas no the richt to lay doon wark? Wha gies service as a sodger, at his ain expense at ony time? Wha plants a vine‐yaird, and eats‐na oʼ the frute? or wha herds a flock, and taks‐na oʼ the milk oʼ the flock? Am I sayin thir things as a man wad say? Or isna the Lord sayin the same? For iʼ the law oʼ Moses it is putten doon, “Ye sanna muzzle the threshin ox.” Isʼt for the owsen God has care? Or, wasʼt for  oor sakes aʼ thegither he said it? Aye! for oor sakes wasʼt putten doon: sae that hopin, the pleughman soud pleugh: and hopin to hae, ane soud thresh. Gin we sawed for you spiritual things, isʼt a muckle thing gin we reap oʼ yere fleshly things? Gin ithers use the richt ower ye, soudna raither we? But we grippit‐na this richt, but raither happit‐up things, that naething soud hinder the Joyfuʼ‐message oʼ Christ. Ken‐ye‐na that they wha serʼ in holie things eat oʼ the things oʼ the holie place? and they wha at the altar staun, wiʼ the altar share? Eʼen sae has the Lord ordeened, that they that declare the Gude‐word, sal hae their breid oʼ the Gude‐word. Hoobeit, I haena taen ony oʼ thir things: and mair, I spak‐na oʼ thae things, that sae it soud be done to me; for I wad suner dee than that ony ane soud mak feckless my gloryin. For, gin I declare the Joyfuʼ‐message, it isna for me a cause oʼ gloryin: for a necessity is lyin on me; for wae is me! gin aiblins I be‐na declarin the Joyfuʼ‐message. For gin I follow this thing oʼ mysel, I hae my meed; but gin it isna oʼ mysel, than it is a factorship I hae been lippenʼd wiʼ. And what, than, is my meed? this: That in declarin the Joyfuʼ‐message, I may mak it free, and withoot cost; that I may‐na ower muckle use my richt iʼ the Joyfuʼ‐message. For eʼen free as I am frae aʼ, I am thirlman to aʼ, that I micht win the mair. To the Jews becam I as a Jew, sae as I micht win the Jews: to thae aneath the Law, as aneath the Law (no bein mysel ʼneath the Law) that I soud win thae under the Law. To thae no haein the Law, as no haein the Law (no bein withoot law to God, but aneath Christʼs Law), sae as I micht win thae no haein the Law. I becam to the weak, as weak mysel, that I soud win the weak; to aʼ men hae I become aʼ things, that by aʼ thir means I micht save some! But aʼ things div I for the sake oʼ the Joyfuʼ‐message, that a partaker oʼt wiʼ you I micht become. Ken‐ye‐na that they wha rin in a coorse aʼ rin, but that ane wins the gree? Sae be rinnin, that ye may win! But ilka ane strivin iʼ the games, is self‐governin in aʼ things. They do it to obteen a fadin croon; but we, ane unfadin! And sae I am rinnin, as no at a ventur: sae fecht I, as no baffin the air: But I am haudin my body under, and garrin it do service; least in onywise, haein proclaimed the Joyfuʼ‐message to ithers, I mysel soud be cuisten aside! For I wadna hae ye unkennin, brethren, hoo oor forebears war aʼ aneath the clud, and aʼ gaed throwe the sea; And war aʼ bapteezʼt intil Moses iʼ the clud and iʼ the sea. And aʼ did eat like spiritual breid; And aʼ did drink like spiritual drink; for they drank oot oʼ a spiritual rock that followʼt them: the Rock, natheless, was Christ. Hoobeit wiʼ mony oʼ them was God ill‐pleased: and he dang them ower iʼ the wilderness. Noo in thir things they becam lessons to us, that we soudna glaum at ill things, as eke they glaumʼd. Nor worship eidols, as some oʼ them: juist as it is putten doon, “The folk sut doon to eat and drink, and raise up to mak sport.” Naither lat us do uncleanness, as some oʼ them did uncleanness, and fell in ae day thrie‐and‐twenty thoosand. Naither lat us tempt the  Lord, eʼen as some oʼ them tempit, and perishʼt wiʼ the serpents. Naither lat us yammer, as some oʼ them yammerʼt, and perishʼt wiʼ the destroyer. But thir things cam to them for examples. And they war puttin‐doon for oor warnin, to wham the hinner‐end oʼ time has come. Sae, lat him wha thinks he stauns, tak tent that he faʼ‐na! Nae trial has come to ye but a human ane; and God is leal and true, and winna lat ye be tryʼt aboon what ye are fit to thole; but wull mak wiʼ the trial a gate oʼ escape, that ye may be able to haud oot. Whaur‐for, my loved anes, flee frae eidol‐worship! As to discernin men I speak; judge ye what I am sayin. The cup oʼ blessin, we bless, isʼt‐na the sharin oʼ the blude oʼ Christ? The laif that we brek, isʼt‐na the sharin oʼ the body oʼ Christ? Seein that we, thoʼ mony, are aʼ ae laif — ae body; for we aʼ oʼ the ae laif partak. Look again at Israʼl accordin to the flesh: are‐na they wha eat the sacrifeeces sharin wiʼ the altar? Yet am I sayin that an eidol‐sacrifeece is onything? or that an eidol is onything? On the contrar: “What things the nations sacrifeece, to the demons do they sacrifeece, and no to God!” and I wadna hae ye to become marrows wiʼ demons. Ye canna be drinkin the Lordʼs cup, and demonsʼ cup; ye canna be sharers oʼ the Lordʼs table, and demonsʼ table. Wad ye provoke the Lord to jealousie? Are we sterker than he? Aʼ things are allooʼt, but aʼ things are‐na for profit: aʼ things are allooʼt, but aʼ things strengthen‐na. Lat nae ane be seekin allenarlie eftir his ain things; but that whilk is his neeborʼs. Whatsaeʼer is sellʼt iʼ the merkits, eat; speirin‐nane on behauf oʼ conscience. “For the hail yirth is the Lordʼs, and aʼ its ootcome!” Gin ony oʼ the misbelievin bid ye, and ye think to gang, eat whateʼer is set afore ye, speirin‐nane on behauf oʼ conscience. But gin aiblins ane say tʼye, “This is a holie sacrifeece!” eat‐na, for the sake oʼ him wha said sae, and for conscience sake; “Conscience,” say I; no yere ain, but the itherʼs. For hoo soud my liberty be evened by anither manʼs conscience? Gin I gratefully am partakin, why am I to be spoken again anent that whilk I am giean thanks ower? Sae, gin ye be eatin, or drinkin, or doin ocht, be doin aʼ to the glorie oʼ God! Be ye free frae offence, baith to Jews and to Greeks, and to the Kirk oʼ God. Accordin as I too am pleasin aʼ men; no lookin for my ain gain, but the gain oʼ the mony, that they may be savʼt. Be ye like me, eʼen as I follow Christ. I gie ye praise that in aʼ things ye hae mind oʼ me; and eʼen as I gied to ye the precepts, ye are haudin them siccar. But I wad hae ye ken that the heid oʼ ilka man is Christ; and the heid oʼ a wumman is the man; and the heid oʼ Christ is God. Ony man prayin or preachin, haein ocht on his head, pits his heid under shame; But a wumman, prayin or preachin wiʼ her heid unveilʼt, pits her heid to shame: for it is as gin she had been shaven. For gin a wumman disna cover hersel, lat her hair eke be shorn. But gin it be shamefuʼ in a wumman to be shorn or shaven, lat her be coverʼt. For a man soudna cover his heid, inasmuckle as he is Godʼs image and glorie; but the wumman is manʼs glorie. For the man is no oʼ the wumman, but the wumman oʼ the man. For naither was man made for the sake oʼ the wumman, but wumman for the sake oʼ the man. For sae soud the wumman wear this permission on her heid; conscious oʼ the Angels. Hoobeit, naither is the man wantin the wumman, nor the wumman wantin the man, in the Lord. For eʼen as the wumman is oʼ the man, sae is the man throwe the wumman: but aʼ things are oʼ God. Think for yere ain sels:— Isʼt seemly for a wumman, uncoverʼt, to be prayin to God? Disna eʼen natur tell ye, that a man, gin aiblins he has lang hair, it is a discredit to him? Whaur‐as, a wumman, gin aiblins she hae lang hair, it is a glorie to her? For the lang hair has been gien to her for a coverin. Gin, hoobeit, ony ane thinks to be contrar, nae sic custom as this hae we, nor yet the kirks oʼ God! But I gie ye this chairge, no to praise ye ava; for that ye are‐na comin thegither for the better, but for the waur. For to begin: thoʼ ye div indeed come thegither iʼ the kirk, I am tellʼt that factions amang ye are springing up; and I somewhat believe it. For pairties amang ye thar maun be; that they that are acceptit amang ye may be schawn. And sae, though ye come thegither intil ae place, it isna to eat the Lordʼs Supper: For ilk ane has his ain supper afore eatin; and sae ane is hungʼry, and anither is steghʼt What? hae‐ye‐na hooses to eat and drink in? Or, div ye belittle Godʼs kirk, and shame thae that hae nocht? What am I to say tʼye? Am I to compliment ye? I compliment‐ye‐na! For I had frae the Lord what I eʼen tellʼt to you, that the Lord Jesus, that nicht in whilk he was betrayʼt, took a laif; And giean thanks, brak it, and said, “This is my body that is gien for you; this do, in memory oʼ me.” And in like mainner the cup too, eftir the takinʼ oʼ supper, sayin, “This cup is the New Covenant in my blude: this div ye, eʼen as aft as ye may drink oʼt, for the remembrance oʼ me.” For, sae aften as ye may be eatin this laif, and drinkin this cup, ye are setting forth the death oʼ the Lord, till whatna time he may come. Sae, whasoeʼer may be eatin the laif, or drinkin the cup oʼ the Lord, in an unwordie way, sal be hauden for the body and the bluid oʼ the Lord. But lat a man pit his sel to the test; and in sic mainner lat him eat oʼ the laif, and drink oʼ the cup. For he that is eatin and drinkin, is eatin and drinkin condemnation to himsel, gin he be‐na  consecratin the body. And sae thar are amang ye, a hantle weak and pinin, and a gude wheen faʼin asleep. Gin, hoobeit, we had been consecrating oorsels, we wadna iʼ that case hae been comin aneath condemnation. But, bein brocht aneath judgment by the Lord, we are chastenʼt, that we soudna be condemned wiʼ the warld. And sae ye, my brethren, whan ye come thegither to eat, wait ye ane for anither. Gin ony man hungʼer, lat him eat at hame, least ye but come thegither for condemnation: and for the lave oʼt, whan I come, I wull set aʼ in order. Noo, anent the “spiritual,” brethren, I wadna hae ye iʼ the mirk. Ye weel ken that whan ye war Gentiles, ye war led to their dumb eidols, hoosoeʼer ye micht be airtit. And sae, I gie ye to ken that nane, speakin wiʼ Godʼs Spirit, maks oot Jesus to be  accurst; and that nae ane can mak oot Jesus to be Lord, but wiʼ the Holie Spirit. But braidlie‐scatterʼt gifts thar are, yet the ae Spirit: And braidlie‐scatterʼt service, yet the ae Lord: And braid‐scatterin oʼ inward wark thar is; and aye the ae God, wha works inwardly aʼ things in aʼ men. But to ilk ane is gien this schawin‐forth oʼ the Spirit, to work whateʼer is best. For to ane is gien indeed throwe the Spirit, a word oʼ inner wisdom; to anither, the word oʼ ootward knowledge, by the same Spirit. To anither, faith, by the ae Spirit, but to anither gifts for healin by the same Spirit. To anither ane, wunner‐warks and pooers; to anither, speakin for God; to anither, discernin oʼ spirits; to anither, mony tongues; but to anither, interpretin oʼ tongues. But aʼ thir dae that ae and the self‐same Spirit work inwardly, giean oot to ilk ane, allenarlie eʼen as he wull. For eʼen as the body is ane, and has a hantle oʼ members, but aʼ the members oʼ the body, mony as they may be, are ae body, sae eʼen in Christ. For in ae Spirit, are we aʼ in ae body bapteezʼt, aither Jews or Greeks, aither bond or free; and war made to aʼ drink oʼ ae Spirit. For the body isna ae member, but mony. Gin aiblins the fit soud say, “For that I am‐na the haun, I am‐na oʼ the body,” isʼt than no oʼ the body? And gin aiblins the lug soud say, “For that I am‐na an ee, I am‐na oʼ the body,” isʼt than no oʼ the body? Gin the hail oʼ the body war ee, whaur the hearin? or gin the hail hearin, whaur the smellin? But noo, God plantit the members, ilk oʼ them, iʼ the body, juist as he pleased. Gin hoobeit, aʼ had been ae member, whaur the body? Whaur‐as, noo, a hantle oʼ members — yet indeed but ae body. Forby, the ee canna say to the haun, “I hae nae need oʼ you!” nor yet the heid to the feet, “I hae nae need oʼ you!” But, on the contrar, muckle mair the members oʼ the body, seemin maist feckless, are needfuʼ; And the pairts oʼ the body we may deem to be wantin in honor, we pit on the mair honor; and oor less favorʼt pairts we busk the mair. Whaur‐as, oor weel‐faurʼd pairts are no in want. But God has mouldit the body weel; giean mair tender care to the pairt that was wantin. That thar soud be nae sedition in the body; but the members hae like care ane ower anither. And gin ae member dree ill, aʼ the members dree wiʼt; or gin ae member be magnifyʼt, aʼ the members are blythe wiʼ it. Noo, ye are Christʼs body; and allenarlie, members: Wham, indeed, God plantit iʼ the Kirk; first oʼ aʼ Apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; helpers; airtins; kinds oʼ tongues. Are aʼ Apostles? aʼ prophets? aʼ teachers? aʼ workers oʼ ferlies? Hae aʼ healin? Div aʼ speak wiʼ tongues? Div aʼ interpret? But desire ye the chief gifts: and noo I airt ye till a better gate forʼt. Gin aiblins I be speakin wiʼ aʼ the tongues oʼ men and oʼ Angels, and want love, I am nae mair nor dunnerin brass, or a jinglin cymbal. And gin I hae the gift oʼ foretellin, and ken aʼ hidden things, and aʼ lear; and gin I hae aʼ faith, sae as to gar mountains flit, but hae‐na love, I am naething. And gin I morsel‐oot aʼ I hae intil hungʼry monʼs, and gie up my body to the lowin fire, and hae‐na love, I am nane the better! Love tholes lang; is kind and cannie: love isna sellie, love vaunts?-?na itsel, isna sune upliftit; Demeans itsel discreetly; seeks‐na her ain: isna gien to flytin; casts nae by‐ganes. Joys‐na ower wrang, but alang wiʼ truth is blythe: Tholes aʼ things, lippens aʼ things, looks forrit to aʼ things, drees aʼ things. Love bides aye. But gin thar be  foretellins, they sal be endit; gin thar be tongues, they sal cease; gin thar be lear, it sal dwine awa. For we ken but in pairt, and we prophesie but in pairt. But whan the perfete is come, than aʼ that is in pairt sal be laid doon. Whan I was a bairn, I spak like a bairn, I esteemed things like a bairn, I thocht like a bairn; but noo, bein a man, I hae putten‐awa bairn‐like things. For noo we see but in a keekin‐gless, aʼ dimly; but than, clearly, face to face: noo, in pairt I ken; but than sal I ken, eʼen as I mysel hae been clearly kent. But noo, firm bides Faith, Hope, and Love, thir thrie; but Love is boonmaist oʼ them aʼ. Follow ye eftir Love: yet be ye fain to hae spiritual gifts; but amang them aʼ, that ye may prophesy. For he that speaks wiʼ anither tongue, isna speakin to men, but to God; for nane listens to him; still, iʼ the Spirit he is speakin deep things. But he that is prophesying is speakin to men for their strenthenin, exhortation, and comfort. He that speaks wiʼ a tongue is strenthenin his sel; but he that prophesies is strenthenin the Kirk. Hoobeit, I desire ye to be speakin wiʼ tongues, but mair that ye may prophesy; for heigher is he that prophesies than he wha speaks wiʼ tongues — unless indeed he expone it, that the Kirk may be strenthened. And noo, brethren, gin I come to ye speakin wiʼ tongues, what better sal ye be, gin I divna speak to ye aither by revelation, or wiʼ wisdom, or by preachin, or by exponin? And sae eʼen things no leevin, giean oot a soond, be it pipe or harp, gin they dinna mak a differ in the notes, hoo sal it be kent what is piped or what is harped? For gin the trumpet gie a wafflin soond, wha wull pit on his graith for the fecht? And sae ye, gin ye gie‐na speech weel‐kent, hoo sal it be up‐taen? for ye wull be speakin to the air. Thar may be an unco‐mony tongues in the warld, and no ane wantin sense. Gin than I ken‐na the meanin oʼ the tongue, I sal be to him wha is speakin like ane fremd; and he that is speakin, fremd to me. Sinʼ than ye be fain to hae Spirit‐gifts, seek that ye may be forrit in strenthenin the Kirk. And sae, lat him wha speaks wiʼ a tongue, pray that he may expone it. For gin I be prayin in a tongue, my spirit is prayin, but my mind isna nourishʼt. What than? I wull pray in the spirit, but I wad eke pray wiʼ the understandin: I wull praise wiʼ the spirit, but I wad eke praise wiʼ the understandin! Els, gin aiblins ye be blessin iʼ the spirit, hoo sal he that is wantin in gifts say the “Amen,” at yere giean oʼ thanks? sinʼ he kens‐na what ye are sayin! For ye are indeed giean thanks weel, but the ither isna strenthenʼt! I gie thanks to God that I speak wiʼ tongues mair nor aʼ oʼ ye. But in the Kirk I wad raither speak fyve words wiʼ my understaunin, that I micht gie ithers lear, than myriads oʼ words in a tongue! Brethren, be‐na bairns in yere understaunins: but in aʼ that is base be ye bairns, while in yere understaunins be ye men. Iʼ the Law thar is putten‐doon, “Wiʼ ither tongues and ither lips, speak I to this folk; and no eʼen sae wull they listen to me, says the Lord.” Sae that tongues are for a testimonie, no to thae that hae faith, but to thae wantin faith: but prophecie isna for thae that are wantin faith, but for they wha hae faith. For gin the hail Kirk come thegither for the ae thing, and aʼ be speakin wiʼ tongues, and thar come in men ungiftit, or wantin faith, wull they no report ye are wud? But gin aiblins aʼ are prophesyin, and thar come in ane wantin faith, or wantin gifts, he is convictit by aʼ; he is pruvʼd by aʼ; the secrets oʼ his heart are made kent; And, faʼin doon on his face, he wull adore God, declarin that God is in ye indeed! Hoo, than, isʼt, brethren? Whaneʼer ye come thegither, ilk ane has a psalm, or an exhortation, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation: lat aʼ things be dune for up‐biggin. Gin it be in a tongue, lat it be wiʼ twa, or at maist by thrie, by turns; and lat ane be exponin. But gif thar be nane to expone, lat him be quate iʼ the kirk: to himsel lat him be speakin — and to God. And as to the prophets, lat twa  speak, or thrie, and lat the ithers discern. But gin aiblins to anither a revelation is made as he is sittin, lat the first be quate: For ane by ane ye can aʼ prophesy, that aʼ may learn, and aʼ hae consolation. And the spirits oʼ the prophets are ruled by the prophets. For God isna a God oʼ tulzies, but oʼ peace; as in aʼ the kirks oʼ the saunts. As for the wives, lat them be quate iʼ the kirks; for it isna allooʼd them to be speakin, but lat them be in submission, eʼen as says the Law. But gin they wad fain learn onything, lat them speir at their ain husbands at hame; for it isna seemly for a wife to be speakin iʼ the kirk. Wasʼt frae you that the word oʼ God gaeʼd oot? or to you allenarlie did it come? Gin ony ane judges he is a prophet, or spiritual, lat him say that the things I am writing to ye are the Lordʼs words. But gin ony ane is ignorant anent this, lat him bide ignorant. Sae than, brethren, be fain to prophesy, and forbid‐na to speak wiʼ tongues; But lat aʼ things be dune decently and in order. Noo, I mak kent tʼye, brethren, the Joyfuʼ‐message whilk I mysel spak to ye, whilk eke ye received, and in whilk eke ye staun. And throwe whilk ye are saved, gin ye haud siccar the word I tellʼt ye, in whilk I spak to ye the Joyfuʼ‐message; gin ye hae‐na lippened in vain! For I deliverʼt to ye, the first thing, hoo that Christ deeʼt for oor sins, as said iʼ the Scripturs; And that he was buryʼt; and that he has been raised — on the third day, as said the Scripturs; And that he schawed his sel to Peter; eftir, to the Twalʼ. Eftir that he schawed his sel to mair nor fyve hunder brethren at ance; the feck oʼ them remainin till noo, but a wheen are faun asleep. Eftir that he schawed his sel to James; and eftir, to aʼ the Apostles; And last oʼ aʼ, as to the untimely birth — eʼen to me! For I am but the least oʼ the Apostles, wha am‐na fit to be caʼd an Apostle, for that I persecutit the Kirk oʼ God. But by Godʼs favor I am what I am: and his favor to me wasna made vain; but, mair aboundin than they aʼ was I in toil: hoobeit, it wasna I, but Godʼs favor wiʼ me. Sae, gin it be I or they, sae we preach, and sae ye lippenʼd. Noo, gin Christ be proclaimed, as bein risen frae ʼmang the deid, hoo say a wheen amang ye that “Thar is nae Risin‐frae‐the‐deid?” But, gin “Risin‐frae‐the‐deid thar be nane,” than no eʼen Christ has been raised! And gin Christ hasna been raised, oor preachin, at last, is vain; and yere believin is aʼ vain! And mair: we are schawn to be fause‐witnesses oʼ God; for we bure witness oʼ God that he raised Christ; wham he raised‐na, gin the deid be‐na raised! For gin the deid are‐na raised, Christ raise‐na! And gin Christ raise‐na, yere faith is aʼ in vain; ye are yet in yere sins! And thae too, wha fell asleep in Christ, perishʼt! Gin we hae but hopit in Christ in this life alane, we are oʼ aʼ men maist to be pitied! But noo, Christ has been raised frae ʼmang the deid, a first‐frute oʼ thame wha are faun asleep! For sin, throwe a man cam death, throwe a man comes eke the Risin‐frae‐the‐deid. For as in Adam aʼ dee, sae in Christ sal aʼ be made leevin. But ilk ane followin in his proper place: Christ, a first‐frute; than they wha are Christʼs, at his comin: Eftirhaun, than the end — whaneʼer he delivers up the Kingdom to God the Faither; whan aʼ rule and authoritie is dune awaʼ wiʼ. For he maun rule till whatna time as he has putten aʼ his faes aneath his feet. The last fae that is dune awaʼ wiʼ, is Death. “For aʼ things are to be putten aneath his feet.” But whaur ane says, “Aʼ things hae been putten aneath,” it is plain that thar is an exception oʼ the Ane wha pat aʼ things aneath him. But, whan aʼ things are putten aneath him, than sal the Son his sel become subject to the Ane wha made aʼ things subject to him — that the Godheid may be aʼ in aʼ! Or else, what is for them that are bapteezʼt for the  deid? Gin the deid be‐na raised ava, why than are they bapteezʼt for the deid? And why soud we be rinnin intil danger ilka ʼoor? Ilk day I am deein, brethren — by aʼ the gloryin whilk I hae ower you in Christ Jesus oor Lord! Gif, like a man, I battled wiʼ wild beass in Ephesus, what is the profit to me? Gif the deid are‐na to be raised, “Lat us eat and drink! for the morn we dee!” Dinna be taen‐in: “Ill company corrupts gude conduct.” Wauken ye to soberness, richtously; and sin‐na; for a hantle ken‐na God. To yere shame speak I. But some may speir, “Hoo are the deid to be raised? and in whatna body are they to appear?” Doitit ane! what seed, eʼen ye saw, isna made leevin till it dee: And what ye saw — no the bouk that sal come to be dae ye saw — but a bare pickle: be it wheat, or ony oʼ the lave. Hoobeit, God gies it a bouk eʼen as he has been pleased; and to ilk oʼ the seeds its richt bouk. Aʼ flesh isna ae kind oʼ flesh; but ane is flesh oʼ men, anither flesh oʼ beass, anither flesh oʼ fowls, and anither oʼ fishes. And thar are heevenly bodies, and yirthly bodies. But ae kind oʼ glorie is the heevenly, and anither kind that oʼ the yirthly. Thar is ae glorie oʼ the sun, and anither kind oʼ glorie oʼ the mune, and yet anither glorie oʼ the starns. Nay, thar is a differ, starn frae starn! And sae iʼ the Risin‐frae‐the deid. It is sawn in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; It is sawn in abasement, it is raised in glorie; it is sawn in fecklessness, it is raised in pooer. It is sawn a nateral body, it is raised a spiritual body. Gin thar is a nateral body, thar is eke a spiritual body! And sae it is putten doon, “The first man, Adam, becam a leevin bein.” But the last Adam, a life‐giean Spirit. Hoobeit, the spiritual cam‐na first, but the nateral: eftir that the spiritual: The first man, oʼ the yirth, yirthly; the second man oʼ heeven. Like as the yirthly ane, siclike are they that are yirthly; and like as the heevenly ane, siclike are they that are heevenly. And eʼen as we bure the likeness oʼ the yirthly ane, we sal eʼen bear the likeness oʼ the heevenly ane. But I say this, brethren, that flesh and blude canna inherit Godʼs Kingdom; nor is corruption to inherit holiness. Tak tent! I unfauld to ye a riddle: We sanna aʼ faʼ asleep; but aʼ sal be cheenged, In a moment, in a blink, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet sal soond, and the deid sal be raised, incorruptible; and weʼse be cheenged. For this corruptible‐man maun needs cleed itsel wiʼ incorruption, and this mortal cleed itsel wiʼ immortality. Sae whaneʼer this corruptible has cleedit itsel wiʼ incorruption, and this mortal has cleeded itsel wiʼ immortality, than sal come aboot the word putten‐doon, “Death was victoriously swallowʼd up!” “Whaur, O Death! is yere victory? Whaur, O Death, is yere sting?” Noo, Deathʼs sting is sin; and sinʼs pooer the Law: But God hae thanks, wha gies us victory throwe oor Lord Jesus Christ! Sae than, brethren beloved, be aye abidin, no to be moved; unco aboundin iʼ the Lordʼs wark aye; kennin yere toil isna in vain in the Lord. Noo, anent the siller for the saunts, eʼen as I gae orders to the Kirks oʼ Galatia, sae eʼen do ye. On the first day oʼ the week, lat ilk ane oʼ ye lay‐by by himsel, gaitherin up, whatsoeʼer he may be prosperʼt wiʼ; least, whan I come, collections may be still gaun on. But, whan I come, whaeʼer ye may appruve, them wull I send wiʼ letters, to cairry yere bounty to Jerusalem. And, gin it be needfuʼ that I gang as weel, they sal gang wiʼ me And I wull come to ye, at siclike time as I gang throwe Macedonia: for I div gang throwe Macedonia. And wiʼ you, aiblins, I may stop, or eʼen winter; and ye sal set me forrit on my journey. For I divna desire to see ye e‐noo, juist in passin; for I am in hope to stop a gey while wiʼ ye, gin the Lord wull. But I wull stop in Ephesus till Pentecost; For a door has been unsteekit for me, great and effectual; and thar are a hantle adversaries. But gin Timothy come, see ye that he may be wiʼye withoot dreid; for, eʼen as I, he is workin the Lordʼs wark. Lat nae ane lichtlie him; but set him forrit in peace, sae as he may come to me; for I am lookin for him wiʼ the brethren. Anent oor brither Apollos: I entreatit him muckle that he wad gang to ye wiʼ the brethren, but his mind wasna to gang noo; but he wull gang whan he sal hae fit opportunity. Tak tent: haud ye fast iʼ the faith; be ye men; be sterk. Lat aʼ things be carryʼt on in love. And I entreat ye, brethren — ye ken the hoose oʼ Stephanus, a first‐frute oʼ Greece, and that they hae set theirsels to a service oʼ the saunts — That ye submit yersels to siclike as thae, and to ilk ane that is helpin in the wark, and toilin. But I am blythe ower the comin oʼ Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus; for they made up for yere want. For they gied rest to my spirit and yours. Be ye, than, ownin sic as thae. The Kirks oʼ Asia salute ye. Aquila and Prisca, wiʼ the meetin in their hoose, salute ye muckle in the Lord. Aʼ the brethren salute ye. Salute ye ane anither wiʼ a sacred kiss. The salutation oʼ me, Paul, wiʼ my ain haun. Gin ony ane loeʼs‐na the Lord, lat him be accursed;  Maran‐atha! The tender love oʼ the Lord Jesus be wiʼye. My love be wiʼye aʼ, in Christ Jesus. Paul, an Apostle oʼ Jesus Christ, by Godʼs wull, and Timothy oor brither, to the Kirk oʼ God whilk is in Corinth, wiʼ aʼ the saunts iʼ the hail oʼ Greece: Lovin‐favor to ye, and quateness, frae God oor Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blest be the God and Faither oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, the Bestower oʼ aʼ mercies, and the God oʼ aʼ comfort, Wha comfortit us in aʼ oor troubles, that we may eʼen be able to comfort thae wha are in trouble, by the comfort we oorsels are comfortit, in God. For eʼen as the sufferans‐oʼ‐Christ are unco mony wiʼ us, sae throwe Christ oor comfort is unco great. But, gin we be in trouble, it is the mair for yere consolation and salvation, whilk is workin to yere tholin the same as we are eʼen noo tholin; and oor hope is siccar on yere behauf. Or, gin ye be comfortit, it is aʼ for yere consolation and salvation. Kennin, that as ye are partakers oʼ the sorrow, sae sal ye eʼen be oʼ the comfort. For we wadna hae ye unkennin, brethren, oʼ oor trouble that befel us iʼ the Province oʼ Asia: hoo that in an unco mainner, ayont oor pooer, war we dung doon, sae that we eʼen gied up the hope oʼ life. But we cairry the sentence oʼ death in oorsels, that we soudna hae confidence in oorsels, but in God wha raises the deid. Wha oot oʼ sae unco a death rescuit us, and wull rescue; on wham we hae turned oor hope that he wull again rescue. Ye also, joinin thegither in prayer for us, that the gift granted to us by the prayers oʼ many, may be thankfully acknowledged. For oor consolation is, the witness oʼ conscience, that in purity, and aefauldness afore God, no in wisdom oʼ man, but by Godʼs favor, we sae leeved iʼ the warld — and mair owerflowin toward you. For we are pittin doon nae ither things than what ye did read and own; and I trust ye wull aye own; Eʼen as ye did eʼen own us in a degree, that we war yere rejoicin, eʼen as ye sal be oors iʼ the day oʼ the Lord Jesus. Noo, in this mind I was gaun to come to ye, that ye micht hae a second joy. And to gang throwe you intil Macedonia; and to come back to ye, and by you to be set on forrit to Judea. And this, was I gaun to do wiʼ levity oʼ mind? or siccan things as I decide, dae I decide conform to the flesh, that wiʼ me thar soud be the “aye, aye!” or the “na, na.” But as God is true, oor word to ye isna “aye” or “na.” For Godʼs Son, Jesus Christ, wha was proclaimed amang ye throwe us, throwe me, and Silas, and Timothy, wasna “aye” and “na,” but it becam “aye” in him! For, hoo mony Godʼs promises may be, in him it is “aye,” and in him it is “Amen,” for the glory oʼ God throwe us. But he wha maks us siccar (alang wiʼ you) for Christ, and wha anointit us, is God. Wha eke sealʼt us for his sel, and gied the first‐frutes oʼ the Spirit in oor hearts. But I tak God as a witness on my saul, that by way oʼ sparin ye, I keepit  frae comin to Corinth. It isna that we hae rule ower yere faith, but are raither helpers oʼ yere joy: for by yere faith ye are staunin. But I determined to mysel, no to come tʼye again wiʼ sorrow. For gin I mak ye wae, wha is he that is to mak me blythe, savin him that I mak wae? And I wrate this vera thing, least whan I cam I micht hae had sorrow frae thae ower wham I soud hae had grund oʼ rejoicin; haein assurance anent ye aʼ that my joy is eʼen the joy oʼ ye aʼ. For ooten oʼ muckle fash and pain oʼ heart I wrate ye, wiʼ mony tears: no that ye soud be made wae, but that ye micht come to ken the unco love I bear sae greatly tʼye. Gin, than, ony ane has made sorrow, no to me has he made it; but — that I press‐na ower strangly on ye — in pairt to ye aʼ. Eneuch for siccan a ane was the rebuke gien by the mony; Sae that, on the contrar, it is raither for you to forgie and comfort; least by his  unco sorrow sic a ane soud be swallowʼt up. And sae I entreat ye to mak siccar your love to him; For eʼen to this end I wrate, sae as I soud hae prufe oʼ you; gin, in aʼ things, ye war obedient. Noo, to ane ye forgie ocht, I too! for eʼen I — what I hae forgien — whaur I forgie ocht — for your sakes I forgie it, afore Christ. Sae as we be‐na oot‐matched wiʼ Sautan; for we are‐na ignorant oʼ his deceits. Forby, whan I cam to Troas, for Christʼs Joyfuʼ‐message, and a door was unsteekit to me in the Lord, I had nae comfort in my saul, at no finding my brither Titus; but, biddin them God‐speed, I gaed oot intil Macedonia; But, to God be praise, wha at aʼ seasons gars us triumph in Christ, and maks the sweet savor oʼ his knowledge kent in ilka place throwe us, That we are a sweet savor oʼ Christ to God, in thae that are saved, and in thae that are tint; In thir, soothly, a savor oot oʼ death, death‐like; but in thae, a savor oot oʼ life, life‐like: and for thir things, wha is aiqual? For we are‐na, as a hantle are, corruptin the word oʼ God; but in aʼ aefauldness, as oʼ God, in the sicht oʼ God, we speak oʼ Christ. Are we to begin again to roose oorsels? Or hae we need, as a wheen ithers, oʼ letters oʼ commendation to ye, or frae ye? Yere ain sels are oor letter, written in oor hearts, kent and read oʼ aʼ men: Schawin yersels that ye are a message oʼ Christ, deliverʼt by us, inscrivit no wiʼ ink, but wiʼ Spirit oʼ the Leevin God; no in tablets oʼ stane, but in tablets, in hearts, oʼ flesh. And siccan certaintie as this hae we, throwe Christ, toward God. No as we war oʼ oor ainsels able, sae as to reckon onything oʼ oorsels; but oor ability is oʼ God. Wha eʼen made us able to be messengers oʼ a new Covenant, no oʼ letter, but oʼ Spirit; for the letter slays, but the Spirit maks leevin. But gin the message oʼ death, inscrivit in stane, cam amid glorie, sae that the children oʼ Israʼl warna fuʼ able to look intil Mosesʼ face, for the glorie oʼ his face — whilk glorie was to come till an end — Hoo soudna raither the message oʼ the Spirit be in glorie! For gin the message oʼ condemnation was in glorie, muckle mair the message oʼ richtousness is fuʼ oʼ glorie. For, in sooth, that whilk was made glorious had nae glorie in comparison, on accoont oʼ the  greater glorie — For gif that whilk was to pass awa cam wiʼ glorie, muckle mair that whilk is to bide has glorie! Haein, than, siccan a hope, we use unco plainness oʼ speech; And no like Moses, wha pat a veil ower his face, sae that the children oʼ Israʼl soudna fuʼ‐look to the end oʼ that whilk was passin awa. But their minds war drumlie. For eʼen to this vera day, the same veil remains at the readin oʼ the auld Covenant, noʼ taen awa; for to be taen awa in Christ. But to this day, whaneʼer Moses is read, a veil ower their hearts is lyin. Hoobeit, whansoeʼer a heart may turn toward the Lord, the veil is to be liftit aff. Noo the Lord is the Spirit; and whaureʼer the Lordʼs Spirit is thar is liberty. But we aʼ, wiʼ unveilʼt face, receivin and reflectin the glorie oʼ the Lord, are cheenged intil the self‐same image frae glorie on to glorie, as frae the Lord the Spirit. And sae, haein this message, eʼen as we had mercie gien us, we didna gie aʼ up; But we disowned the secret things oʼ shame, and gang‐na in deceit, nor in a twafauld way dealin wiʼ the word oʼ God; but by the schawin oʼ the truth, seekin favor oʼ ilk manʼs conscience iʼ the sicht oʼ God. But gin aiblins oor Joyfuʼ‐message has onyway come till ye veilʼt — to them wha war perishin it cam to be veilʼt; In wham the god oʼ this warld made drumlie their perceptions, least they soud discern the brichtness oʼ Christʼs Joyfuʼ‐message oʼ glorie, wha is the image oʼ God. For we proclaim‐na oor ain sels; but Christ Jesus as Lord, and oorsels as yere servitors for Jesusʼ sake. For God, wha said, “Oot oʼ the mirk lat licht shine!” has lichtit‐up oor hearts, to gie the licht oʼ the knowledge oʼ God iʼ the face oʼ Christ. But we hae this treasur in veschels oʼ clay, that the owermasterin oʼ the pooer may be oʼ God, and no oʼ us. On ilka side pressed sair, but no helpless; switherin, but no lackin escape; Pursued, but no abandoned; dung doon, but no made an end oʼ; Aye bearin aboot iʼ the body the putten‐to‐deid oʼ Jesus; that sae eʼen the life oʼ Jesus micht be schawn in oor body. For evermair, we, the leevin, are deliverʼt up tae death, for Jesusʼ sake, that Jesusʼ life micht be schawn in oor mortal flesh. Sae that death is wrocht in us, inwardly; but life in you. Hoobeit, we hae the same spirit oʼ faith, conform to what is putten‐doon, “I had faith, thar‐for spak I;” sae we hae faith, and thar‐for spak: Lippenin that he wha raised up the Lord Jesus, wull also wiʼ Jesus raise us, and wull present us wiʼ you. For aʼ things are for yere sakes, sae that, wiʼ grace aboundin throwe the mony, it may mak the praise to abound the mair, to the glorie oʼ God. Thar‐for we are‐na faint‐heartit; but eʼen thoʼ oor ootward man dwines awa, yet oor inward man is ilka day renewin. For the wee bit passin sorrow that we hae, is workin oot for us, aye mair and mair, a mair excellent and eternal wecht oʼ glorie; Sae lang as we look‐na for things seen, but for things unseen: for the seen things are but for a time, but the things no seen are for aye. For we ken, that gin aiblins oor yirdly sheilin be taen doon, we hae a biggin oʼ God, a dwallin no made wiʼ hauns, eternal iʼ the Heevens. For truly, in this behauf we maen, unco fain to hae spread ower us oor hoose whilk is oʼ heeven; Gin sae that bein coverʼt, we sanna be fund nakit. And vera truly, we that are iʼ the sheilin dae maen, bein hauden doon: yet we are‐na fain to be uncoverʼt, but raither to cover oorsels ower; that what is mortal micht be swallowʼt up in immortality. Noo, he wha wrocht us oot for this vera thing is God, wha eʼen gied to us the first‐frutes oʼ the Spirit. Haein gude heart at aʼ times; kennin that whiles bidin iʼ the body, we are awa frae the Lord; For we are gaun on by faith, and no by oor ain een. We hae gude heart nane‐the‐less, and are pleased raither to gang frae oot the body, and to come ben to the Lord! And sae we are unco fain — be we at hame, or awa frae hame — to pleasur him. For we maun aʼ be made seen at the bar oʼ Christ, that ilk ane may hae conform to the things dune iʼ the body, eʼen as he has dune, be they gude or ill. Kennin than the dreid oʼ the Lord, we perswad men; but to God we are weel‐kent; and I wad hope that eʼen in yere consciences we hae been made weel‐kent. We dinna commend oorsels again to ye, but gie ye opportunity to commend us; that ye may hae something for thae wha boast oʼ their ootward things, and no in heart. For eʼen gin we war daft, it was for God; or are douce and grave, it is for you. For Christʼs love rinks us in; for we sae judge, that gin ane deeʼt for aʼ, than in consequence aʼ deeʼt; And he deeʼt for aʼ, that the leevin soud leeve nae langʼer to their sels, but for him wha on their behauf deeʼt and raise again. Sae that we, frae this oot, ken nae man, conform to the flesh; eʼen gin we hae — conform to the flesh — kent the Messiah, yet noo, frae this oot, in siclike ken we him nae mair. Sae than, gif ony man is in Christ, thar is a new creation! auld things hae gane by; lo! aʼ things are made new! But they are aʼ oʼ God, wha reconcilʼt us to himsel throwe Christ, and gied to us the message oʼ reconciliation; Hoo that God, in Christ, was reconcilin the world to his ain sel, no coontin up to them their sins; and did pit in us the message oʼ the Reconciliation. For Christ, than, are we Envoys, as gin God war entreatin throwe us: we beseech, for Christ, “Be ye reconcilʼt to God!” Him that kent nae sin has he made for us to be as  sin; that ye micht come to be a richtousness oʼ God. Workin thegither wiʼ him, we entreat ye no to receive the tender‐love oʼ God in vain! For he says, “At a favorable time I heard ye, and in a day oʼ salvation I befreendit ye.” Tak tent! Noo a favorable time; lo! noo a day oʼ salvation! Giean nae occasion oʼ stumblin in onything, that oor ministration be‐na wytit: But in aʼ things commendin oorsels as Godʼs servitors; in muckle patience, in dool, in needs, in stretts, In stripes, in imprisonments, in bruilzies, in toilins, in waukrifeness, in fastins, In continence, in knowledge, in lang‐tholin, in unco kindness, in the Holie Spirit, in aefauld love, In the truthfuʼ word, in the pooer oʼ God, by the wapins oʼ richtousness iʼ the richt haun and the left; Throwe glorie and shame, throwe ill‐report and gude‐report, as imposters and yet aefauld; As fremd and yet weel‐kent; as deein, and lo! we are leevin; as cloured, and no killed; As in dool, yet aye rejoicin; as in poortith, yet makin mony rich; as haudin naething, yet haudin siccar aʼ things; O Corinthians! oor mooth is open tʼye; oor heart is enlairged! Ye are‐na held‐in in us, but ye are held‐in in yer ain affections. Noo for a return to ye (as to my ain bairns I speak) be ye enlairged as weel! Be‐na  yokin yer sels thrawartlie wiʼ misbelievers; for whatna ane‐ness hae holiness and iniquity; or hoo can licht marrow wiʼ mirkness? Or what‐na ane‐ness has Christ wiʼ Belial! or what is atween a believer and a mis‐believer? Or what‐na ane‐ness has a temple oʼ God wiʼ eidols? For ye are a temple oʼ God, wha is a leevin God; eʼen as God said, “I wull dwall in them, and gang in them, and wull be their God; and they sal be my folk. “Whaur‐for, come ye oot oʼ their mids, and be ye allenar,” says the Lord, “and touch‐na the unclean thing; “And I wull tak ye in, and be a Faither to ye, and ye sal be to me for sons and dochters, says the Lord Almichty.” Haein than thir promises, belovʼd anes, lat us mak oorsels free frae uncleanness oʼ flesh and saul, makin holiness perfete iʼ the fear oʼ God. Gie us a place in yere hearts! We wrangʼd nane, we corruptit nane, we defraudit nane! I am‐na sayin this to wyte ye; for, as I hae said afore, ye are in oor hearts to leeve and dee wiʼ you. An unco freedom oʼ speech hae I tʼye; unco boastin hae I oʼ ye: I am fuʼ oʼ comfort, I am unco filled wiʼ joy in aʼ oor troubles. For eʼen whan we cam intil Macedonia, oor flesh had nae rest, but in aʼ ways war we in a tulzie: ootwardlie fechts; inwardlie switherins. But he wha comforts the humble anes, comfortit us, eʼen God; by the comin oʼ Titus. And no allenar by his comin, but by the comfort whaur‐by he was comfortit on yere accoont, whan tellin us oʼ yere fain desire, yere lamentation, yere zeal for me; sae that I rejoiced the mair. For, gin eʼen I made ye wae wiʼ the letter, I am‐na regrettin, thoʼ I did regret; for I see that yon letter made ye wae — eʼen gin it was but an ʼoor. But noo I am blythe — no that ye war made wae, but that ye war made wae to repentance; for ye war made wae accordin to God, that ye micht hae damage frae us in naething. For dool accordin to God works repentance to salvation; no to be regrettit. But the dool oʼ the warldʼs‐kind works oot death. For behauld! this vera thing — the makin wae accordin to God: what unco tentiness it wrocht in ye; what judgin oʼ yer sels; what sair indignation, what fear, what fain desire, what zeal, what repayin! In aʼ things ye hae schawn yersels to be pure in this maitter. And sae, eʼen gin I wrate tʼye, it wasna for his sake that did the wrang, nor for his sake wha dreeʼd the wrang, but that oor care on yere behauf micht be made kent tʼye, in Godʼs sicht. And on this accoont we hae been comfortit; but mair — we did rejoice uncolie iʼ the joy oʼ Titus, that his heart was refreshʼt by ye aʼ. Sae, gin I hae boastit onywise oʼ you to him, I wasna made to be shamed; but as we tellʼt ye aʼ things truly, sae oor boastin afore Titus was seen to be true. And his tender‐love is aʼ the mair toward ye, whan he caʼs to mind the obedience oʼ ye aʼ, and hoo wiʼ fear and trimlin ye received him. I joy than that in aʼ things I can lippen ye. Forby, we mak kent tʼye, brethren, the favor oʼ God schawn to the Kirks oʼ Macedonia, That in a great trial oʼ sorrow, the rowth oʼ their joy aboundit intil a rich liberality. That, accordin to their pooer, aye eʼen ayont their pooer, oʼ their ain accord, They prayed us wiʼ entreaty, as to takin pairt in the giean to the saunts. And far  ayont oor hopes; giean their ain sels first to the Lord, and to us by Godʼs wull. Sae that we exhortit Titus, that as he had made a beginnin, he soud also perfete in you this favor as weel. And sae, as in aʼ things ye abound, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and diligence, and in love to us — ye micht abound too in this grace. No by way oʼ commaun div I speak; but for pittin the quality oʼ yere love to the test, on accoont oʼ ithersʼ readiness. For ye understaun the love oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, in that he made his sel puir for yere sakes (thoʼ he was rich!) that ye, throwe his poortith, micht be made rich. And in this I gie ye my mind! for this is weel for you, wha indeed begude a year syne, no only to do, but also to wull. And noo, perfete the doinʼ oʼt: that eʼen accordin to the readiness to wull, thar may be the cairryin oot oʼ what ye hae. For gin the readiness to wull is set forth accordin to what a man has, it is appruvʼt; and no accordin to what he has no. For I dinna say that ithers soud hae ease, and ye be burdened. But by an aiqual‐sharin, yere rowth enoo soud be for their want; that their rowth soud eʼen come to be for yere want; that thar may be aiquality. Eʼen as it is putten doon, “He that gaitherʼt the mair had nane ower muckle, and he that gaitherʼt the less lacked‐na.” But God be praised, wha pat the same anxiety in the mind oʼ Titus anent ye. For thoʼ he acceptit the exhortation, yet bein his sel unco diligent, he gaed till ye oʼ his ain wull. And we joined wiʼ him the brither, whase praise in the word is throwe aʼ the Kirks. And no only sae, but wha was deputit by the Kirks to travel wiʼ us in this behauf, whilk is serʼd by us to the Lordʼs glorie, and to schaw oor zeal. Haein it sae, that nae ane soud wyte us in this bounty we are awmoners oʼ. Providin honorable things, baith in the sicht oʼ the Lord, and afore men. And we hae jointly sent wiʼ them oor brither wham we hae testit in mony things, at aʼ times, and fund diligent; but noo, muckle mair sae, wiʼ the unco confidence he has toward ye. Whether is it onything aboot Titus? A pairtner oʼ mine, and a fellow‐worker wiʼ you. Or aboot oor brethren? They are Apostles to the Kirks, and the glorie oʼ Christ. Ye did schaw, tharfor, afore the Kirks, the exhibition oʼ yere love, and oor boastin on yere behauf tae them. For anent the service for the saunts, it is needless for me to write to ye. For I ken yere readiness oʼ mind, for whilk I roose ye afore them oʼ Macedonia, that Greece was ready a year syne; and yere zeal has steered up the lave. But I hae sent the brethren, least oor boast on yere behauf soud be in vain in this respect; that, as I said, ye micht be preparʼt. Least, gif aiblins Macedonians cam wiʼ me, and faund ye no ready, we (that we may‐na be sayin “ye,”) soud be putten to shame iʼ this confidence. Sae I thocht it necessar to exhort the brethren that they soud gang forrit till ye, and mak up afore‐haun yere promised liberality, sae as it micht be ready, as a gift gien, and no a thing extortit. But as tae this: He wha saws sparely, sal eʼen reap sparely; and wha saws wiʼ blessins sal eʼen reap wiʼ blessins. Ilk ane sae, eʼen as he had it in his heart; no oʼ sweirness, nor oʼ necessity; for “God loʼes a cheerfuʼ giver.” But God has pooer to mak aʼ favor to abound wiʼ unco rowth, toward ye! sae that in aʼ things and at aʼ times, haein a sort oʼ plenty oʼ yere ain, ye may abound mair and mair in aʼ gude warks. As it is putten doon: “He disponed abreid; He gied to the puir; His richtousness bides for aye.” Noo he wha gies “seed to the sawer, and breid for eatin,” sal supply and mak lairge yere seed sawn, and mak to flourish the ootcome oʼ yere richtousness; In aʼ things bein made rich to aʼ liberality; whilk is workin oot praise to God. For the cairryin‐oot oʼ this public service isna only makin up for the lack oʼ the saunts, but is  frutefuʼ oʼ mony praises to God. For that mony, throwe this workin‐oot oʼ this service, are magnifyin God for the obedience oʼ yere confession to the word oʼ Christ, and for the aefauldness oʼ yere gifts for them and for aʼ; They their sels, wiʼ prayers on yere behauf, are unco fain, for the wonderfuʼ favor oʼ God to ye. Praise be to God for his unmeasurable bounty! Noo I Paul, mysel, entreat ye by the meekness and canniness oʼ Christ; wha ootwardly to the een am lowly amang ye, but as awa am bauld toward ye; I entreat, hoobeit, that bein present, I may‐na be bauld wiʼ the bauldness I wad hae again a wheen wha look on us as gin we gaed accordin to the flesh. For thoʼ we are walkin iʼ the flesh, we are‐na battlin conform to the flesh. For the wapins oʼ oor warfare are‐na fleshly, but strang wiʼ God for dingin doon stranghaulds, Puʼin doon lofty thochts, and ilka heigh thing that wad heize up itsel contrar to the knowledge oʼ God; and takin captive ilka motive intil subjection to Christ. And haudin oorsels ready to avenge aʼ disobedience, whansaeʼer yere obedience may be seen. Are ye lookin at things accordin to their appearance? Gin ony man thinks he is Christʼs, lat him think thus again till his selʼ, that eʼen as he is Christʼs, sae are we Christʼs. For gif indeed muckle mair I soud boast a wee oʼ oor poor, whilk the Lord gaʼe for up‐biggin, and no for dingin ye doon, I sanna be putten to shame. That I maun‐na seem as gin aiblins I wad gliff ye wiʼ a letter. For “his letters,” says ane, “are vera true, wechty, and oʼ pooer; but his bodily presence is waff, and his  discoorse oʼ nae account!” But lat siccan a ane ken, that oʼ whatna sort we are in oor letters whan we are awa, sae sal we be whan present, in oor wark. For we are‐na bauld to even oorsels wiʼ some wha speak weel oʼ their sels. But they, measurin their sels amang their sels, and evenin their sels wiʼ their sels, are wantin in gude understaunin. We, hoobeit, no as regairds unmeasurʼt things, wull boast oor sels; but by the rule God has measurʼt to us, to extend eʼen to the lenth oʼ you. For it isna as gin we raxʼt‐na the lenth oʼ you, or war raxin oor sels unduly; for eʼen the lenth oʼ you war we aforehaun, wiʼ the Gude‐word oʼ Christ. No as boastin oʼ unmeasurʼt things, in ither menʼs labors; but haudin a hope by yere strang faith, oʼ bein enlairged accordin to oor measur, for mair abundance, Intil the districts ayont ye, to cairry the Gude‐word; and no by ony ithersʼ rule oʼ things made ready, to boast. But wha may boast, lat him boast iʼ the Lord; For it isna the ane that speaks weel oʼ his sel the Lord is pleased wiʼ, but the ane the Lord speaks weel oʼ. I wad that ye coud thole me in a wee fulishness: indeed ye are tholin me. For I am jealous ower ye wiʼ the jealousy oʼ God: for I espoused ye to ae husband, that I micht gie ye ower as a pure maiden to Christ. But I fear least in onywise, eʼen as the serpent beguiled Eve wiʼ his craft, sae yere minds soud be airtit awa frae the aefauldness and purity that are for Christ. For gin ane comin brings ye anither Jesus, wham we brocht‐na, or ye receive anither Spirit wham ye hae‐na received, or anither Gude‐word that ye hae‐na welcomed — ye micht weel  thole him. For I reckon to hae come nane short oʼ the maist pre‐eminent Apostles. But, gin I war  plain in my speech, yet no wantin in lear! but in aʼ ways we made it kent in aʼ things to you. Or, did I do wrang in loutin doon mysel that ye micht be heizʼt up, in giean to ye the Gude‐word for nocht? I took frae ither kirks, takin fees frae them that I soud serʼ you. And bein wiʼ you, and wantin, I wasna a burden tae ony man; for my lack the brethren frae Macedonia made up. And in aʼ things I keepit mysel frae bein a burden, and sae wull I keep mysel! Eʼen as the truth oʼ Christ is in me, iʼ this boastin I sanna be stoppit in aʼ the land oʼ Greece! Whaurfor? for that I loʼe‐ye‐na? God kens better! But, as I am doin, I wull do, that I may sned aff occasion frae thae wha seek for occasion; that in what they glorie they be fund eʼen as we are. For sic men are fause apostles, deceitfuʼ workers, cheengin theirsels intil Apostles oʼ Christ. And nae ferlie, for Sautan his sel is cheengin his sel intil an Angel oʼ licht. Nae unco ferlie, than, gin his servants, too, are cheengin theirsels as servants oʼ richtousness: whase end sal be eʼen as their warks are. And mair: lat nae ane tak me to be glaikit; but eʼen sae, as a glaikit ane bid me come ben, that I too may boast mysel a wee. What I am sayin I am‐na sayin eftir the Lord; but as in havers, in this confidence oʼ boastin. Sinʼ mony boast theirsels iʼ the flesh, I wull boast as weel. For ye thole fules withoot murmurin, bein wyss yersels. For ye thole ane wha is makin bondmen oʼ ye — wha is devoorin ye, wha is reivin frae ye — wha is magnifyin his sel — wha is baffin ye on the face. I speak by way oʼ lichtliean, as gin we war feckless. But whaur ony ane is bauld (I am speakin in a haverin way) I am bauld too! “Hebrews” are they? I as weel! “Israʼlites” are they? I as weel! “Servitors oʼ Christ” are they? (As ane daft I am talkin,) I eʼen mair! In toils mair abundant; in imprisonments muckle mair abundant; in stripes ayont coontin; in deaths aft. Frae Jews, fyve times did I hae the “forty‐save‐ane.” Thrice was I cloured wiʼ rods; ance staned; thrice ship‐wrackʼt; a day and a nicht hae I spent iʼ the deep: In journeyins aft; in perils oʼ rivers; in perils oʼ robbers; in perils frae my ain folk; in perils ʼmang fremʼd folk; in perils iʼ the citie; in perils iʼ the desert; in perils iʼ the sea; in perils ʼmang fause brethren. In labor and distress; in watchins aft; in hungʼer and drouth; in fastins aft; in cauld and nakitness. And forby the things left oot, that whilk comes on me day by day — to tent aʼ the Kirks. Wha is weak, and am‐na I? Wha is bein snared, and am‐na I burnin? Gin ane maun boast, oʼ the things I am weak in wull I boast. The God and Faither oʼ the Lord Jesus — he wha is blessed for aye — kens that I speak‐na fausely. In Damascus, the native Governor ʼneath Aretas the king, was gairdin the citie oʼ the Damascenes to grip me. And throwe a winnock was I loutit doon in a creel  by the waʼ, and escapit his hauns. To boast may be needfuʼ thoʼ it has nae profit; sae I wull come to visions and revelations oʼ the Lord. I ken a man in Christ, wha fowrteen years syne (and gin he was in the body, or oot oʼ the body, I ken‐na — God kens), was claught up, siccan a ane as this, the lenth oʼ the third Heeven, And I ken sic a man as this (gin he was iʼ the body, or oot oʼ the body, I ken‐na — God kens), That he was claucht up into Paradise, and heard unutterable things, whilk it is‐na for a man to speak. For sic a ane as this wull I boast, but for mysel I winna boast but in my ain weaknesses. For eʼen soud I be fain to boast, I sanna be a fule; for I wull speak truth. But I lat be, that nae ane soud think oʼ me aboon what he sees me to be, or hears frae me. And whaur‐for, least by the unco greatness oʼ the revelation I soud be ower muckle upliftit, thar was giʼen to me a stog iʼ the flesh, a messenger oʼ Sautan that he micht baff me. In this behauf, I thrice entreatit the Lord, that it micht gang frae me. And he said to me, “My tender love is eneuch for thee; for my strenth is  perfited in weakness!” Maist blythely, than, wull I boast mysel raither iʼ my weaknesses, that the pooer oʼ Christ may be ower me, and around me. Sae, than, I am content in weaknesses, in skaithins, in necessities, in persecutions, in stretts — on behauf oʼ Christ; for whan I mysel am weak, than am I stieve! I hae become glaikit; ye hae compelled me! For I micht weel hae been commendit by you; for I am naething short oʼ the maist pre‐eminent Apostles — eʼen thoʼ I be naething! Truly, the tokens oʼ an Apostle war wrocht amang ye, in aʼ lang‐tholin; in signs, and ferlies, and pooers. For in whatna way war ye made inferior to the lave oʼ the Kirks, exceptin that I mysel wasna burdensome to ye? Forgie me this wrang! Tak tent! the third time I am haudin mysel in readiness to come to ye; naither wull I be burdensome; for I seek‐na yours, but you! For the bairns are na to be layin up gear for the parents, but the parents for the bairns. For, unco blythely wull I spend and be aʼ spent in behauf oʼ yere sauls: thoʼ, the mair I loʼe ye, the less am I loʼed. But, be it sae! I didna burden ye. But bein pawkie, I tuik ye wiʼ guile! Was thar ony ane oʼ thae I sent tʼye, by wham I tuik advantage oʼ ye? I entreatit Titus, and I sent him wiʼ the brethren: surely Titus didna take advantage oʼ ye? Wasʼt no iʼ the same spirit we walkit? wasʼt no iʼ the same fit‐prints? Ye think, aʼ this time, we are makin apology tʼye! Afore God, in Christ, are we speakin. But aʼ things, beloved, are for yere up‐biggin. For I am in fear, least in ony way, haein come, I soudna finʼ in ye sic as I wad desire; and that I soud be fund oʼ you sic as ye wadna. Least by ony means strivins, envies, belchins oʼ wrath, diveesions, ill‐speakins, swallins, tulzies, be fund. Least, haein come again, my God sal humble me amang ye, and I sal hae to mak maen ower mony oʼ thae wha had afore sinned, and hae‐na repentit oʼ the uncleannesses, and lechery, and wantonness they war guilty oʼ. This third time am I come tʼye! “At the mooth oʼ twa witnesses, or thrie, sal ilka word be made siccar!” I tellʼt ye afore‐haun, and div tell ye afore‐haun, as gin I war wʼye the second time, to aʼ thae wha sinned, and to the lave — that gin I come again, I wull‐na spare! Sinʼ ye are seekin a prufe oʼ Christ speakin in me, who isna feckless toward ye, but is michty amang ye; For he was crucifyʼt oot oʼ weakness; nane‐the‐less he leeves wiʼ Godʼs pooer: for eʼen we are weak in him, but we sal leeve wiʼ him, oot oʼ Godʼs pooer toward ye. Try yersels, gin ye be iʼ the faith: pit yersels to the prufe. Or ken‐ye‐na oʼ yere ain sels gin Jesus Christ be in you! except, aiblins, ye be outerlins. But I trust ye sal ken we are‐na orts nor outerlins. But we pray God ye do nae evil: no that we may seem acceptit, but that ye may do what is bonnie, eʼen thoʼ we be as outerlins. For we hae nae pooer contrar to the truth, but only on the truthʼs side. And we joy whaneʼer (we bein weak) ye are strang: and for this thing we pray, yere perfection. Sae for this reason I tell ye thir things, bein absent; that bein wʼye I mayna need to deal snelly, accordin to the pooer the Lord gaʼe me — no for puʼin doon, but for up‐biggin. But noo iʼ the end, brethren, rejoicin, restore yersels to order; be consoled; be oʼ the ae mind; leeve thegither in peace; and the God oʼ love and peace sal be wiʼ ye! Greet ye ane anither wiʼ a sacred kiss. Aʼ the saunts salute ye. The favor oʼ the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love oʼ God, and the indwallin oʼ the Holie Spirit, be wiʼ ye aʼ! Paul, an Apostle, no frae men nor throwe men, but throwe Jesus Christ, and God the Faither wha raisʼt him frae amang the deid, And aʼ the brethren wiʼ me, to the Kirks oʼ Galatia: The peace and gude favor oʼ God the Faither tʼye, and oor Lord Jesus Christ, Wha gied his sel for oor sins, that he micht deliver us oot oʼ this present warld, whilk is an ill ane; conform to the wull oʼ oor God and Faither, To wham be glorie for evir and evir. Amen! I ferlie that thus sae sune ye are changin frae him wha perswadit ye intil Christʼs love, intil some ither “Gude‐word,” Whilk indeed isna  anither Gude‐word! But that are some wha are fashin ye, and wad damage the Gude‐word oʼ Christ. But eʼen aiblins it soud be we, or an Angel frae Heeven, wha soud bring ye anither Gude‐word, differin frae what we gied tʼye, lat him be accursʼt! As said we syne, sae say I noo again, Gin ony ane gies ye a “Gude‐word” differin frae what ye gat, lat him be accursʼt! For, at this time, div I perswad men, or dis God? Or div I seek to please men? If aye I am pleasin men, Christʼs servant am‐I‐na! For I mak kent tʼye, brethren, as to the Gude‐work whilk was tellʼt by me; that it isna conform to men; For naither did I frae man obteen it, nor was I learned it by man, but throwe a revealin oʼ Jesus Christ. For ye heard, as anent my mainner oʼ life at ae time, in Judaism, that in an unco way I persecutit the Kirk oʼ God, and laid it waste; And was gaun on in Judaism ayont my marrows amang my ain folk, bein unco zealous for the traditions oʼ my forebears. But wham it pleased God (wha took me sindry frae my mitherʼs womb, and invitit me by his grace), To reveal his Son in me, that I soud deliver the Gude‐word regairdin him amang the heathen, at ance I coonsellʼt‐na wiʼ flesh and blude, Nor gaed I up to Jerusalem to them that war Apostles afore me; but I gaed awa intil Arabia, and cam back again to Damascus. Than, thrie years eftir, I gaed up to Jerusalem, to get acquant wiʼ Peter; and bade wiʼ him fyfteen days. But oʼ the lave oʼ the Apostles saw I nane, but James, the brither oʼ the Lord. Noo, as to whatna things I am tellin ye, tent ye! in presence oʼ God, I am‐na speakin fause. And syne, I gaed intil the kintra oʼ Syria and Cilicia. Forby, I wasna kent by face to the Kirks oʼ Judea whilk are in Christ. Only they war hearin, “He wha was persecutin us at ae time, is noo preachin the Joyfuʼ‐message oʼ the faith that ance he laid waste!” And they magnifyʼt God in me. Than, in the coorse oʼ fowrteen year, I gaed up again to Jerusalem, wiʼ Barnabas; takin Titus as weel. And I gaed up by revelation; and laid afore them the Gude‐word whilk I preach amang the nations; to their sels, privately, hoobeit, wiʼ thae oʼ distinction,  least by ony means I soud run, or had been rinnin in vain. And no eʼen Titus, wha was wiʼ me, thoʼ he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumceesed. And this was on accoont oʼ fause brethren, secretly brocht in; wha cam in but to spy oot oor liberty whilk we hae in Christ Jesus, that sae they soud bring us intil bondage; To wham, no eʼen for an ʼoor, gied we place by siccan a submission; that the truth oʼ the Gude‐word micht still bide wiʼ you. But frae thae held to be in repute — (whatsoeʼer they war at ae time is naething to me, God accepts nae manʼs face) — thae oʼ repute addit naething to me. But on the contrar, seein I was entrustit wiʼ the Gude‐word to the uncircumceesion, eʼen as Peter was to the circumceesion, For he that wrocht in Peter for an apostleship oʼ the circumceesion, wrocht eʼen in me for the heathen. And seein the favor whilk was gien to me, James and Peter and John, wha war reputit pillars, gied to me and Barnabas a richt haun oʼ britherhood, that we soud gang to the heathen, and they to the circumceesion. Only, that we “soud be mindfuʼ oʼ the puir;” as to whilk, I was eʼen fuʼ oʼ zeal, this vera thing to do. But whan Peter cam to Antioch, I stude up again him to his face, for that he was to be wytit. For, afore certain anes cam frae James, he did eat wiʼ the Gentiles; but whan they cam, he held back, and keepit his sel allenar, in fear oʼ thae oʼ the circumceesion. And the lave war usin this doobleness wiʼ him, sae that eʼen Barnabas was cairryʼt awa wiʼ their deceit. But whan I saw they warna gangin upricht iʼ the truth iʼ the Gude‐word, quoʼ I to Peter afore them aʼ, “Gin ye — bein a Jew to begin wiʼ — leeve in a Gentile way, and no in a Jewish mainner, hoo div ye gar Gentiles to be Judaizin? “We, Jews by natur, and no sinners frae amang Gentiles, “Kennin that a man isna justifyʼt by warks oʼ Law, but only throwe faith in Christ Jesus, eʼen we pit oor faith in Christ Jesus, that we soud be justifyʼt by faith in Christ, and no by warks oʼ Law: for by warks oʼ Law sal nae flesh be justifyʼt. “Gin, hoobeit, thoʼ seekin for justification in Christ, eʼen we oorsels are fund sinners, is Christ than a bringer‐in oʼ sin? Far frae it! “For gin I bigg up again whatna things I puʼ doon, I schaw mysel to be guilty. “For I, throwe Law, deeʼt to the Law, that I soud leeve to God! “I hae become crucifyʼt wiʼ Christ: nay, I leeve allenar nae langʼer, but Christ is leevin in me; and the life I noo hae iʼ the flesh, I leeve iʼ the faith oʼ the Son oʼ God, wha loʼed me, and gied his sel up on my behauf. “I am‐na settin aside the grace oʼ God; for gin throwe Law is richtousness, Christ maun hae deeʼt in vain!” O glaikit Galations! wha cuist glamour ower ye, afore whase vera een Jesus Christ was clearly schawn as a crucifyʼt Ane? I wad but ken this frae ye, Wasʼt by the warks oʼ the Law that ye hae gotten the Spirit, or by the hearin oʼ faith? Are ye sae glaikit? Eftir makin a beginnin iʼ the Spirit, are ye noo gaun to be perfitit iʼ the flesh? Tholed ye sic things for nocht? (gin it yet be for nocht.) He than that supplyʼt to ye the Spirit, and wrocht ferlies amang ye, did he it by warks oʼ the Law, or by hearin oʼ faith? Eʼen as Abraʼm lippened God, and it was reckoned to him as richtousness. Ken, than, that they oʼ faith, eʼen they are bairns oʼ Abraʼm. And the Scriptur, lookin forrit to God justifyin the heathen throwe faith, announced aforehaun the Gude‐word to Abraʼm: “They sal be blest in thee; eʼen aʼ the Nations!” Sae than, they oʼ faith are haein a blessin alang wiʼ faithfuʼ Abraʼm. For as mony as are oʼ Law‐warks, are ʼneath a curse; for it is putten doon, “Accurst is ilka ane wha gangs‐na on in aʼ things iʼ the Buik oʼ the Law, to do them!” But that in Law, nae ane is hauden richtous wiʼ God, is plain; for, “The richtous ane sal leeve by faith!” But the Law isna “by faith;” on the contrar, “He wha dis them sal leeve in them.” Christ redeemed us oot oʼ the curse oʼ the Law, bein made a curse on oor behauf: for it is putten doon, “Accurst is ilka ane hingin on a tree.” Sae that to the Nations the blessin oʼ Abraʼm micht come, in Jesus Christ; that we soud hae the promise oʼ the Spirit by faith. Brethren! humanly am I speakin; yet, a human covenant nae ane sets by, or adds to. Noo, to Abraʼm war the promises spoken, and to his Seed. It disna say, “And to seeds,” as oʼ mony; but as oʼ ane, “And to thy Seed,” whilk is Christ. But say I, A covenant eʼen afore made siccar by God, the Law (whilk eftir fowr hunner and thretty years cam in), disna pit by, that it soud mak the promise feckless! For gin aiblins the inheritance is “by Law,” it is nae langer “by promise;” but to Abraʼm, by promise, had God bestown it. Why, than, the “Law”? For the cause oʼ sin it was addit, till siccan a time as the Seed, to wham it was promised, soud come; whilk Law was gien in chairge by messengers, at the haun oʼ a Mediator. But the Mediator isna oʼ ane; but God is  ane. Was the Law, than, contrar to the promises oʼ God? Far frae it! for gin a law war gien that had pooer to gie life, truly, than, by Law soud hae been richtousness. But the Scriptur steekit up aʼ things as aneath sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ soud be gien to thae that hae faith. But afore faith cam, we war keepit siccar ʼneath the Law; shut in to the faith aboot to be made kent. Sae that the Law has been oor bairn‐keeper to tak us to Christ, that we soud, throwe faith, be declarʼt richtous. But, faith haein come, we are nae mair aneath a bairn‐keeper. For ye are aʼ sons oʼ God throwe the faith in Jesus Christ. For ye, as mony as war bapteezʼt into Christ, hae putten on Christ. Thar isna to be said “Jew” nor “Greek”; thar isna to be said “bond” nor “free”; thar isna to be said “male” nor “female”; for aʼ ye, thegither, are ane in Christ Jesus! And, gin ye are Christʼs, than are ye Abramʼs seed; and heirs, eʼen as said the promise. But I say, sae long as the heir is a bairn, he differs‐na frae a servant, eʼen thoʼ aiblins he be the laird oʼ aʼ. But is aneath bairn‐keepers and overseers, till the time set by the Faither. Sae we too, whan we war bairns, war keepit in bonds to the  hornbuik oʼ the warld: But whan the fuʼ time cam, God sent oot his Son, wha cam oʼ a wumman, wha cam aneath the Law, That he micht redeem thae aneath the Law, sae that we coud receive the adoption oʼ bairns. And mair: for that ye are sons, God sent oot his Sonʼs Spirit into oor hearts, cryin oot, “Abba! Faither!” Sae ye are nae mair a servant but a bairn; and gin a bairn, than an heir, throwe God. But than, in sooth, no kennin God, ye war in bondage ʼneath thae that war by natur nae gods: Whaur‐as noo, eftir that ye hae owned God (or raither been owned oʼ him), hoo isʼt that ye are gaun back again to the feckless and beggarlie beginnins, to whilk ye wad fain, ower again, be in bondage? Ye preceesely observe days, and months, and years. I am fearʼt for ye, least by ony means I hae toiled for ye in vain! Become ye as I; for that I too becam as yersels. Brethren, I entreat ye! In naething did ye wrang me! But ye ken hoo that by reason oʼ a weakness iʼ the flesh, I preached to ye the Gude‐word at the first, And the temptation ye saw iʼ my flesh ye despised‐na, nor scunnerʼt at it! but took me to yere hearts as an Angel oʼ God; as Christ Jesus! Whaur, than, is that happiness oʼ yours? For I witness tʼye that, gin it had been possible, yere ain een wad ye hae pykit oot, and gien to me! Sae noo, hae I gotten to be yere fae, for that I deal leal wiʼ ye! They zealouslie seek ye, but no in a gude way; aye, they wad  steek ye oot, that ye may seek eftir them! But it is gude, for a gude thing to be socht eftir wiʼ zeal, at aʼ times, and no only whan I am wiʼ ye. My bairns! oʼ wham again I am in birth‐pangs, till siccan a time as Christ be formed in you. Aye! I coud wiss to be wiʼ ye e‐noo, and to change my speech; for I am in a swither aboot ye. But tell me, ye that wad fain be ʼneath the Law! div ye no hear the Law? For it is putten‐doon, “Abraʼm had twa sons; ane by a bondmaid, and ane by a free wumman.” But the ane by the bondmaid, hoobeit, was born eftir the mainner oʼ the flesh; whauras the ane by the free wumman throwe a promise. Whilk things, in sooth, are a parable. For thir weemen are twa covenants; ane frae Mount Sinai, bringin forth to bondage, whilk in sooth is Hagar. For “Hagar” is Mount Sinai in Arabia; and is like to Jerusalem that noo is, and is in bondage wiʼ her bairns. But the Jerusalem aboon is free, wha indeed is mither to us aʼ. For it is putten‐doon, “Rejoice ye barren that bure‐na; brek oot intil shouts, ye that warna in birth‐pangs! for mair are the bairns oʼ the desolat, than oʼ her that has the husband.” But we, brethren, eftir the mainner oʼ Isaac, are bairns oʼ the promise. But, just as than, the ane born eftir the flesh persecutit the ane born eftir the Spirit, eʼen sae is it e‐noo. But what says the Scriptur? “Pit ye oot the bondmaid and her son; for in naegate sal the bairn oʼ the bondmaid inherit alang wiʼ the bairn oʼ the free.” Sae, brethren, we are‐na the bondmaidʼs bairns, but the free wummanʼs! Wiʼ freedom Christ maks us free: staun ye steive than, and be‐na hauden fast wiʼ ony yoke oʼ bondage! Tak tent! I Paul say tʼye, that gin ye receive circumceesion, Christ wull profit ye nocht. But I witness to ilka man again that receives circumceesion, that he is a bund debtor to the hail Law. Ye are set aside frae Christ, ye wha wad be justifyʼt iʼ the Law: ye are faun awa frae his favor. For we throwe the Spirit, are fain waitin for the hope oʼ richtousness. For in Christ Jesus, naither circumceesion coonts for ocht, nor uncircumceesion; but faith, wrocht inwardly by love. Ye gaed weel; wha taiglʼt ye, that ye soudna comply wiʼ the truth? This compliance wasna oʼ him wha caʼd ye! A wee barm wull gang throwe the hail melder. I am perswadit oʼ ye iʼ the Lord, that ye winna be thrawart; but he that fashes ye sal dree his weird, whaeʼer he may aiblins be. But I, brethren, gin I be preachin circumceesion, why am I sae persecutit? for than had the bogle oʼ the “Cross” been dune awa. I wad they eʼen wad cut aff their sels, that fash ye. For ye war caʼd in freedom, brethren: but turn‐na yere freedom intil an indulgence to the flesh, but raither by yere love serʼ ye ane anither. For the hail Law is bund up in ae word, this: “Ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yersel!” But gin ye gansh at and devoor ane anither, tak tent that ye be‐na destroyʼt ane oʼ anither. On the ither haun, I say, Walk ye iʼ the Spirit, and the wull oʼ the flesh ye sanna fulfil. For the flesh has desires contrar to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrar to the flesh: for thir again ane anither are set; that ye  may‐na do the things ye wad itherwise do! But, gin than ye are led by the Spirit, ye are‐na under the Law. But plain to be seen are the warks oʼ the flesh; whilk are adultery, lechery, wantonness, Idolatry, divination, hatred, faʼin‐oot, jealousy, wrath, factions, pairties, Envyins, bludeshed, druckenness, revellins, and siclike things; as to whilk I tell ye plainly, eʼen as I hae tellʼt ye afore, that they wha practeese sic things as thir sanna inherit Godʼs kingdom. But the frute oʼ the Spirit is love, happiness, peace, lang‐tholin, canniness, gudeness, lealness, Meekness, self‐guidin; again sic things as thir thar is nae law! But they wha are oʼ Christ Jesus, hae crucifyʼt the flesh, wiʼ its desires and hankerins. Gin we leeve by the Spirit, by the Spirit lat us eʼen be airtit. Lat us no be seekin for vain glorie; challengin ane anither, envyin ane anither. Brethren, gin aiblins a man be betrayʼt intil a faut, ye wha are spiritual recover sic a ane iʼ the spirit oʼ canniness; lookin to yersel, least ye yersel be tempit. Uphaud ye ane anitherʼs burdens, sae sal ye perform the Law oʼ Christ. For gin a man thinks he is something, whan he is naething, he is but deceivin his sel in his ain mind. But lat ilka man test his ain wark; and than sal he hae pleasur in himsel allenarlie, and no in what anither thinks. For ilka man sal cairry his ain back‐burden. Nane‐the‐less, lat him that is instructit iʼ the Word hae  fellowship wiʼ him that instructs, in aʼ gude things. Dinna deceive yer sels; God isna to be mocked; for what a man saws, the same sall he shear; For he that saws till his ain flesh, oot oʼ the flesh sal hae corruption; but he wha saws to the Spirit, oot oʼ the Spirit sal hae Life‐for‐aye. But in doin what is weel, lat us no be cuisten‐doon; for in due time we sal reap, gin we gie‐na‐up. Sae than, eʼen as we hae openins, lat us work what is gude toward aʼ men, special toward the hoosehauld oʼ the Faith. (See wiʼ sic muckle letters I wrate tʼye, wiʼ my ain haun!) As monie as wad mak a bonnie schaw iʼ the flesh, they wad gar ye be circumceesed, only that they soudna dree persecution for the Cross oʼ Christ. For no eʼen they wha hae become circumceesed are their sels observin the Law, but they wad hae ye circumceesed, that they micht boast theirsels in your flesh. But wiʼ me, lat it be far frae boastin, gin it be‐na in the cross oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, throwe wham the warld to me is crucifyʼt, and I to the warld. For in Christ Jesus naither circumceesion is onything, nor uncircumceesion, but a new creation. And till as mony as are gaun on by this rule, peace and mercy on them, and on the Israʼl oʼ God! For the lave, lat nane gie me fash; for I bear aboot in my body the brands oʼ the Lord Jesus! Oor Lord Jesus Christʼs favor wiʼ yere spirit, brethren! Amen! Paul, an Apostle oʼ Christ Jesus, throwe the wull oʼ God, to the saunts in Ephesus, and aʼ the leal anes in Christ Jesus: Lovin‐favor to ye, and peace, frae God oor Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ! Blessed aye, the God and Faither oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ; wha blessʼt us in aʼ spiritual blessin on Heigh in Christ! Conform to his acceptin us in him afore the up‐biggin oʼ the warld, that we soud be pure and wyteless in his presence; In love settin us oot aforehaun for adoption oʼ bairns, by Jesus Christ to himsel, conform to the gude‐pleasur oʼ his wull, To the praise oʼ the glorie oʼ his lovin‐favor, wiʼ whilk he favored us in the Beloved Ane: In wham we hae salvation throwe his blude, the passin‐by oʼ offences, eʼen as by the richness oʼ his favor; Whilk he garʼt to owerflow to us; in aʼ wisdom and skill, Makin kent to us the hidden secret oʼ his wull, eʼen by his gude guidin that he ettled in his sel, Lookin to the perfeteness oʼ the times, to bring thegither aʼ things for Christ oʼ things in heeven and things on yirth, aʼ in him; In wham eʼen we war made an inheritance, bein set oot aforehaun by the purpose oʼ him wha works aʼ things by the coonsel oʼ his ain mind. That we soud be for the praise oʼ his glorie, wha war the first to lippen to Christ. In wham ye too, hearin the leal word, the Gude‐tidins oʼ yere salvation — in wham lippenin, war sealʼt wiʼ the Holie Spirit oʼ promise. Wha is the  arles oʼ oor inheritance, till the possession be aʼ redeemed, to the praise oʼ his glorie. For the same cause, I too, hearin oʼ yere faith iʼ the Lord Jesus, and the love ye hae to aʼ the saunts, Am aye giean thanks on yere accoont, namin ye ower iʼ my prayers. That the God oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, the Faither oʼ glorie, may gie ye a spirit oʼ wisdom and revealin in his knowledge: Yere inward een bein fuʼ oʼ licht, that ye may come to ken what the hope oʼ his blythe‐bidden is, what his rich inheritance oʼ glorie iʼ the saunts, And what the unmeasured vastness oʼ his pooer toward us wha hae faith, eʼen as by the up haudin oʼ his micht, Whilk he wrocht in Christ, raisin him frae ʼmang the deid, and settin him doon amang aʼ the heevenlies, at his ain richt‐haun, Far up aboon aʼ rule, and authoritie, and pooer, and dominion, and ilka name that is named, no alane iʼ this warld, but eke in that that is to come: And “pat aʼ things under his feet”; and gied him as heid ower aʼ things to the Kirk; Whilk in sooth is his body, the completion oʼ him wha completes aʼ in aʼ for himsel. And you, brocht to life, war deid in offences and sins; In whilk ye gaed in time by‐past, eʼen as in the way oʼ this warld, conform to the ruler oʼ the pooer oʼ the air, the spirit noo workin iʼ the bairns oʼ dourness; Wiʼ wham eʼen we oorsels had oor life at ae time iʼ the fainness oʼ the flesh, obeyin the craikins oʼ the flesh and oʼ the thochts; and war bairns oʼ wrath by natur, eʼen as war the lave. But God, plenteous in mercy, for his unco love he loʼed us wiʼ, Eʼen thoʼ we war deid by oor sins, brocht us to life, alang wiʼ Christ (by tender‐love are ye saved!); And wiʼ him raised us up, and wiʼ him gied us heevenlie seats, in Christ Jesus; That he micht schaw iʼ the ages to come, the unco owergaun riches oʼ his love, in kindness to us in Christ Jesus; For, it is by his love ye hae been saved, throwe faith; and this comes aboot, no frae you; it is Godʼs free gift. No frae warks, least ony ane soud boast; For his ain wark are we oorsels; bein formed in Christ Jesus for gude warks, whilk God afore made ready that we soud gang in them. Sae, keep ye in mind, that at ae time ye, Gentiles iʼ yere flesh, named “Uncircumceesion” by the sae‐caʼd “Circumceesion” in flesh, made wiʼ hauns; That ye war, at yon time staunin sindry frae Christ; bein fremd to the citizenship oʼ Israʼl, and bein strangers as to the covenants oʼ promise, wantin hope, and wantin God iʼ the warld! But e‐noo, in Christ Jesus, ye wha war ance far‐awa, are made sib, in the blude oʼ Christ. For he is the makin oʼ oor peace, wha made  baith to be aye, and dang doon the dividin‐waʼ; Haein, in his ain flesh, dune awa the hostility, and the law oʼ requirements in ordinances; that oot oʼ the  twa he soud mak to his sel ae new‐formed man; makin peace. And soud reconcile them baith perfetely in ae body to God, throwe the cross; slayin the hostility by the same: And cam, and deliverʼt the Gude‐word oʼ “Peace to you oʼ the  far‐awa, and peace to the nar at?-?haun.” For it is throwe him we hae the comin‐in — we baith — iʼ the ae Spirit, to the Faither. Sae than, ye are nae mair fremʼd‐folk and gangrels; but are marrows oʼ the saunts, and are oʼ the hoosehauld oʼ God. Bein up‐biggit on the fundation oʼ the Apostles and Prophets; Christ Jesus his sel the heid corner‐stane: In wham the hail edifice iʼ the way oʼ bein fitly laid thegither, is growin to be a holie Temple oʼ the Lord. In wham ye too are bein biggit thegither, intil a dwallin‐place oʼ God iʼ the Spirit. And sae I, Paul, prisoner oʼ Christ Jesus for you the Gentiles, Gin at least ye hae heard oʼ the stewardship oʼ the grace oʼ God whilk was gien to me for you, That by way oʼ revelation was made plain to me the hidden secret, eʼen as I wrate afore in a wee wheen words, As to whilk ye may be able, by readin, to ken my knowledge oʼ the hidden secret oʼ Christ, Whilk knowledge in the generations by‐gane wasna made kent to the sons oʼ men, as it is noo made plain to his holie Apostles and Prophets iʼ the Spirit — That they oʼ the nations soud be aiqual heirs, and aiqual body, and aiqual pairtners iʼ the promise in Christ Jesus, by the Gude‐word. Oʼ whilk I was made a servitor, as by the free gift oʼ the tender‐love oʼ God, gien to me, conform to the workin oʼ his pooer: To me, wee‐er than the wee‐est oʼ aʼ saunts, was gien this gude‐favor, to bring to the nations the Gude‐word oʼ the uncoontit riches oʼ Christ. And to gie licht as to what is the fellowship oʼ the secret quaisten that has been hid awa frae the former time in God, wha made aʼ things. Sae that noo micht be made kent to heevenlie pooers and authorities throwe the  Kirk, the mony‐fauld wisdom oʼ God. Conform to the ever‐bidin purpose he ettled in Christ Jesus oor Lord, In wham we hae bauldness oʼ speech, and oʼ approach, wiʼ assurance, throwe oor faith in him. Sae, desire I, that ye swarf‐na at my sorrows for you: whilk indeed are your glorie. And for this I bend my knees to the Faither, Frae wham the hail family iʼ heeven and yirth is named, That he wad gie you, conform to the richness oʼ his glorie, wiʼ aʼ pooer to hae micht iʼ the inwart man, To hae Christ dwallin throwe faith iʼ yere hearts; Rutit and grundit, that ye may be strang to grip siccar, wiʼ aʼ ither saunts, what is the breidth and lenth, and heighness and deepness, And to come to ken the love oʼ Christ, ayont aʼ tellin, that ye may be fuʼ wiʼ the fuʼness oʼ God. Noo, to him wha has pooer ower aʼ things, to do uncolie and unmeasurably abone aʼ things we can seek or think, eʼen as his pooer works in us, To him be the glorie, in the Kirk, and in Christ Jesus, to aʼ generations, and ages upon ages! Amen. I entreat ye, than, I the Lordʼs bondman, to gang on in mainner wordie oʼ the bode wiʼ whilk ye are biddin; Wiʼ aʼ laichness oʼ mind and canniness; tholin lang, forbearin wiʼ ane anither, In love takin tent to keep the ane‐ness oʼ the Spirit, iʼ the union?-?bond oʼ peace. Ae body; ae Spirit; eʼen as ye war bidden in ae hope oʼ yere biddin; Ae Lord; ae faith; ae bapteezin; Ae God and Faither oʼ us aʼ; he wha is ower aʼ, and throwe aʼ, and in aʼ. But to ilk oʼ us, lovin favor was gien, conform to the measur oʼ Christʼs free‐gift. Sae, says he, “Gaun up on heigh, he made captivitie captive itselʼ, and gied gifts to men.” But this, “He gaed up,” what isʼt, save that he eke gaed doon intil the under‐pairts oʼ the yirth? The ane wha gaed doon, is the ane wha gaed up, far aboon the heevens, that he micht hae aʼ things. And he gied some for Apostles, and some for prophets, and some for preachers, and some for pastors and teachers; To fit the saunts for the wark oʼ service, for the up‐biggin oʼ the body oʼ Christ. Till we aʼ win forrit to the ane‐ness oʼ the faith, and oʼ the perfete knowledge oʼ the Son oʼ God, intil manʼs estate, intil the measur oʼ the height oʼ the perfeteness oʼ Christ. That nae mair soud we be bairns, tossʼt as on billows, and blawn aboot wiʼ ilka swee oʼ doctrine, iʼ the pawkiness oʼ men, in knaverie; eftir the wiles oʼ wrang. But, speakin truth in love, soud grow intil him in aʼ things, wha is the heid, Christ. Oot oʼ wham aʼ the body, fitly marrowed thegither, and made siccar by ilka joint supplying, eʼen as by the inner workin iʼ the measur oʼ ilka pairt, maks siccar the growin oʼ the body, intil an up‐biggin oʼitsel in love. This, than, I say iʼ the Lord, that ye soud nae langer walk conform to the Gentilesʼ walkin, iʼ the vainness oʼ their mind. Wiʼ their understaunin made mirk, fremʼd frae the life oʼ God, throwe ignorance whilk is in them, throwe want oʼ feelin iʼ their heart; Wha indeed hae gotten to be by aʼ feelin, giean theirsels up wiʼ wantonness to the workin aʼ uncleanness wiʼ greed. But ye didna in siccan a way learn Christ. Gin at least ye heard him, and war instructit in him, as the truth is in Jesus, That sae soud ye cast aff, as to yere past doing, the “auld” man, wha corruptit his sel conform to deceitfuʼ desires; And be made young again, iʼ the spirit oʼ yere mind, And soud pit on the “new” man, wha eftir God is creatit in richtousness and holiness oʼ truth. Sae, tharfor, castin aff what is fause, “Speak ye truth ilk man wiʼ his neebor,” for that we are pairts ane oʼ anither. Be ye vexed, and yet sin‐na; lat‐na the sun gang doon on yere angʼer; And gie nae fit‐stance tae Sautan. Lat him that staw steal nae mair, but raither toilin, workin wiʼ his ain hauns at what is fit, that he may hae to gie to him wha has‐na. Lat nae  vileness gae forth frae yere mouʼ; but raither what is gude, airtit to the up‐biggin oʼ the needs, and to the giean oʼ grace, for them that hear. And dinna mak the Spirit grieve, in wham ye war sealed to the day oʼ redemption. Aʼ bitterness, and wrath, and ill‐wull, and stour, and miscaʼin, lat them be taen awa frae ye, wiʼ aʼ malice; And be ye gracious ane till anither, eʼen as God in Christ forgaʼe you. Be ye than taking paittern eftir God, as bairns belovʼd; And walk in love, eʼen as Christ loʼed you, and gied his sel up on yere behauf, an offeran and a sacrifeece to God, for an odour oʼ sweetness. But lecherie, and aʼ uncleanness, or selliness, lat‐na sic be eʼen named amang ye; eʼen as befits saunts; Nor shamelessness, nor glaikit speech, nor levity; whilk are‐na fittin; but raither giean oʼ thanks. For this ye ken, and tak tent! that nae lecherous ane, nor unclean person, nor covetous man (wha is an eidol‐worshipper!) has ony pairt iʼ the kingdom oʼ Christ and God. Be‐na cairryʼt awa wiʼ a sough oʼ words; for it is for thir things the wrath oʼ God sal come doon on the bairns oʼ thrawartness. Dinna then become pairtners wiʼ them! For ye war at ae time mirkness; but noo are ye licht, iʼ the Lord; gang ye on as bairns oʼ the licht! For the ootcome oʼ the licht is in aʼ gudeness, and uprichtness, and truth; Puttin to the prufe what is weel‐pleasin to the Lord. And be‐na ye marrows iʼ the shamefuʼ warks oʼ mirkness, but raither challenge them. For it is shamefuʼ eʼen to speak oʼ the things wrocht by them hidlins. But aʼ things whan they are challenged, are made plain by the licht: for that whilk maks things plain is “licht.” Sae it is  said, “Wauken, ye sleepin ane! and rise frae ʼmang the deid, and Christ sal shine on ye!” Tak ye tent, than, to walk cannilie; no as glaikit, but as wyss; And win ye for yersels the opportunity; for the days are ill. And sae, be‐na ye simple, but be ye discernin as to what the Lordʼs wull may be, And be‐na ye fouʼ wiʼ wine, in whilk is riot; but be ye fouʼ oʼ the Spirit, Speakin amang yersels in psalms and hymns, and godly sangs, liltin and makin music iʼ yere hearts to the Lord, At aʼ times giean thanks for aʼ things, iʼ the name oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, to yere God and Faither. Pittin yersels aneath ane anither, in the fear oʼ Christ. Lat wives be in submission to their ain husbands, as to the Lord: For the husband is the wifeʼs heid, as Christ is the Kirkʼs heid; and he is the Saviour oʼ the  body. And, as the Kirk submits hersel to Christ, sae the wives, in a things, to their husbands. Ye husbands, loʼe yere wives, eʼen as Christ loʼed the Kirk, and gied himsel up in her behauf, That he micht sanctify it, makin it clean wiʼ the weshin oʼ watir by the word, That he micht present, aʼ — glorious, to himsel, the Kirk, no wiʼ a blotch or a runkle, or ocht sic thing, but that she sould be holie and fautless. Sae soud husbands loʼe their wives as their ain bodies. He that loʼes his ain wife loʼes his sel. For nae ane at ony time scunners at his ain flesh, but nourices and cherishes it, eʼen as Christ dis the Kirk. For, pairts are we oʼ his ain body. “For sae sal a man leaʼ his faither and mither, and be ane wiʼ his wife; and the twa sal become ae flesh.” This is a great riddle; but I speak in regaird to Christ, and in regaird to the Kirk. Nane‐the‐less be ye, ilk ane oʼ ye, sae loʼein his wife, eʼen as his ain sel; and the wife, hae reverence for her husband. Ye bairns, be dutifuʼ to yere ain parents, iʼ the Lord; for this is bonnie. “Honor thy faither and thy mither” (whilk indeed is the first commaun wiʼ a promise); “That it may gang weel wʼye, and ye may leeve lang on the yirth.” And ye faithers, dinna wauken‐up angʼer in yere bairns; but rear them up iʼ the chastenin and admonishin oʼ the Lord. Ye servants, mind yere maisters iʼ the flesh, wiʼ reverence and trimlin, in aefauldness oʼ yere heart, as to Christ! No by way oʼ ee‐service, as man‐pleasers, but as Christʼs servitors, doin Godʼs wull frae the heart; Wiʼ gude‐wull doin service, as to the Lord, and no to men: Kennin that ilk ane, whatna gude he may dae, eʼen that sal he hae back again frae the Lord — gin he be bond or free. And ye, maisters, div ye the like things to them, kennin that their Maister and yourʼs is in Heeven; and thar is nae respectin oʼ faces wiʼ him. And for the lave oʼt — Be ye strang iʼ the Lord, and iʼ the pooer oʼ his micht! Pit ye on the hail graith oʼ God, sae as ye may be fit to staun again the wiles oʼ Sautan. For oor struggle isna again flesh and blude, but again the pooers, again the authorities, again the warld‐rulers oʼ this mirkness; again the spiritual hosts oʼ ill iʼ the  lift. Whaur‐for tak to ye the hail graith oʼ God, that ye be strang to withstaun iʼ the ill day; and, haein dune aʼ things, to staun. And sae staun! beltit aboot the mids wiʼ truth, and haein put on the prufe‐coat oʼ holiness; And shod yere feet wiʼ the readiness oʼ the Gude‐word oʼ Peace; And wiʼ aʼ, takin up the shield oʼ faith, in whilk ye hae pooer to kep aʼ the lowin shafts oʼ the Ill‐ane. And the heid‐piece oʼ salvation tak ye; and the sword oʼ the Spirit, whilk is whatsoeʼer God has spoken. Wiʼ aʼ prayer and pleadin, prayin aye iʼ the Spirit; and watchin iʼ the same, wiʼ aʼ tholin and pleadin, for aʼ the saunts; And for me, that to me soud be gien utterance, that wiʼ freedom oʼ speech I may mak kent the Gude‐wore; For sake oʼ whilk I am like an ambassador in a chain; that in sic behauf I may be bauld to speak, as I soud speak. But that ye may ken things regairdin me, Tychicus, the weel‐loʼed brither, and leal servant oʼ the Lord, wull mak aʼ things kent tʼye: Wham I send to ye for this vera purpose, that ye micht come to ken oor state, and that he micht console yere hearts. Peace to the brethren, and love, wiʼ faith, frae God the Faither and the Lord Jesus Christ. Tender love be wiʼ aʼ thae that loʼe oor Lord Jesus Christ wiʼ lealness! Paul and Timothy, servitors oʼ Christ Jesus, to aʼ the saunts in Christ Jesus that are in Philippi, wiʼ the bishops and deacons: Tender love to you, and peace, frae God oor Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I am aye giean thanks to my God, at ilka thocht oʼ you, Aye in ilka prayer oʼ mine for ye aʼ, makin request for ye wiʼ joy, On accoont oʼ yer  fellowship iʼ the Gude‐word, frae the first day till noo: Bein siccar iʼ this vera thing, that he wha begude a gude wark in ye, wull perfete it to the day oʼ Christ Jesus. Eʼen as it is richt in me to hae siccan a regaird oʼ ye; for that ye hae me iʼ yere heart, baith iʼ my bonds, and iʼ the defendin and makin steive the Gude‐word; ye aʼ bein marrows wiʼ me oʼ my grace. For God is witness to me, hoo fain I am for ye aʼ, in the tender mercies oʼ Jesus Christ. And for this I pray, brethren, that yer love yet mair and mair may exceed, in fuʼ knowledge and discernment; To the end ye may pit to the test the things that are gude, that ye may be holie and fautless to the day oʼ Christ; Bein fuʼ oʼ the frute oʼ richtousness; that whilk is throwe Jesus Christ, to the glorie and praise oʼ God. Noo, I wad hae ye to ken, brethren, that the things regairdin me hae raither come oot to the advantage oʼ the Gude‐word. Sae as my bonds hae been made kent iʼ the hail Heid‐quarters, and to aʼ the lave. And sae as that the feck oʼ the brethren, haein been heartened iʼ the Lord by my bonds, are mair uncolie bauld, fearless speakin the word oʼ God. A wheen, indeed, oot oʼ envy and strife, and some oot oʼ gude‐wull, are preachin Christ. Thir, oot oʼ love, kennin I am set for the defence oʼ the Gude‐word; But thae, oot oʼ thrawartness are settin oot Christ; no in lealness; thinkin to mak fash to me iʼ my bonds. Weel what? Juist this, that in ony way, gin it be in deceit or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and I in this am blythe, and wull be blythe! For I ken that this sal turn aʼ to my  salvation, throwe yere prayers, and the giean to me oʼ the Spirit oʼ Jesus Christ; Conform to my fain lookin‐forrit, and my hope, that in naething sal I be putten to shame; but that wiʼ aʼ freeness oʼ speech, as aye, sae eʼen noo, Christ sal be glorifyʼt iʼ my body, gin it be by life, or by death. For to me, leevin is Christ; and deein is treasur. But, gin leevin iʼ the flesh is Christ, this to me is a reward oʼ toil; and whatna I sal wale I say‐na, But I am hauden atwixt the twa; haein an unco fainness to be looten awa, and to be wiʼ Christ, for this is far, far better! But to be bidinʼ iʼ the flesh is mair necessar for yere sakes. And haein oʼ this been made siccar, I lippen that I sal bide, and stay ahint wiʼ ye aʼ, for the up‐biggin oʼ yere faith, and for yere joy. That yere glorying may be the mair in Christ Jesus — as to me — by my presence wiʼ ye again. Only, in siccan a way as is wordie oʼ the Gude‐word, airt yere lives; sae that gin I come and see ye, or gin I be frae ye, I may be hearin oʼ ye, that ye staun siccar iʼ ae spirit, wiʼ ae saul joined thegither, for the faith oʼ the Gude‐word; And no bein fleyʼt in ony thing by thae opposin their sels: whilk, in truth, is for them a token oʼ destruction, but oʼ yere salvation; and this frae God. For, to you was gien as a favor, no only to be haein faith in Christ, but eke in his behauf to be sufferan: Haein the like tulzie that ye saw in me, and noo hear in me. Gin, than, thar is ony comfort in Christ, gin ony consolation oʼ love, gin ony fellowship oʼ the Spirit, gin ony tender‐mercies and compassions, Croon ye my joy, that ye aʼ may regaird the same things, and hae the same love; aʼ ane in saul, the ae thing regairdin. Doin naething for strifeʼs sake, nor for prideʼs sake; but in humbleness oʼ mind, lookin aye on ane‐anither as bein better nor yersels. No lookin on yere ain things allenarlie, but ilk ane at anitherʼs things. That whilk ye in Christ Jesus  prefer, that prefer ye in yersels; Wha bein originally iʼ the form oʼ God, thocht it no a thing to seize on, to be coontit aiqual wiʼ God; But humblʼt his sel, takin a servantʼs form, and comin in manʼs likeness; and, bein fund in condition as a man, He made his sel lowly, becomin obedient eʼen till the deid; aye, death on a cross. Whaur‐for God upliftit him far on heigh, and gied him a name whilk is  aboon ilka name; That iʼ the name oʼ Jesus, ilka knee soud lout, oʼ thae in heeven, and thae on the yirth, and aneath the yirth, And ilka tongue soud own that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glorie oʼ God the Faither. Sae, than, beloved, eʼen as ye hae aye obeyʼt, no in my presence alane, but noo muckle mair whan I am awa, work ye oot yere ain salvation wiʼ fear an trimʼlin. For God it is wha is workin in ye, baith the ettlin and the inward doin conform to his gude pleasur. And do aʼ things free frae yammerin, and argle‐barglin, That ye may become fautless and innocent bairns oʼ God, wyteless amang a thrawart and perverse generation; amang wham schaw yersels as lichts iʼ the warld; Giean oot the word oʼ life, for a glorie to me iʼ the day oʼ Christ, that I didna rin in vain, nor toil in vain. But, gin I am eʼen to be offerʼt on the sacrifeece and service oʼ yere faith, I am blythe in mysel and blythe wiʼ you. And — as to the same thing — be ye blythe in yersels and blythe wiʼ me! But I am lookin forrit iʼ the Lord, sune to send Timothy to ye; sae that eʼen I may be made blythe, whan I ken yere state. For I hae nae ane like him in saul, wha wull be sae aefauld‐anxious aboot yere state: For they aʼ seek eftir their ain things, no the things oʼ Jesus Christ. But the prufe oʼ him ye ken; for, like a bairn wiʼ a faither, he has had service thegither wiʼ me iʼ the Gude‐word. Sae I am lookin forrit to send him at ance, whaneʼer I may look awa frae the things that concern me. But I lippen iʼ the Lord that I mysel may come sune. Yet I thocht it needfuʼ to send tʼye Epaphroditus, my brither, and marrow, and fellow‐sodger, but your messenger, and the provider for my needs. For he was unco fain to see ye aʼ; and in dolor for that ye had heard he had been ill. And, in truth, he was ill, and nar to the deid; but God schawed mercie to him, and no to him allenarlie, but to me as weel, least sorrow on sorrow I soud dree. Wiʼ the mair entreaty I hae sent him, that, seein him again, ye soud be blythe, and I hae the less dool. Be ready than to tak him tʼye, wiʼ aʼ joy iʼ the Lord; and siclike as thir haud ye in honor; For it was for the sake oʼ Christʼs wark he was nar to the deid; rinnin risk wiʼ his life that he micht mak up yere want oʼ care for me. And noo, to sum up, my brethren: Be blythe iʼ the Lord! To write to you the  same things isna fashious, whilst for you it is safe. Be ye ware oʼ the dougs, tak ye tent oʼ the workers oʼ ill, keep awa frae the  conceesion. For we are the circumceesion, wha worship in Godʼs Spirit, and glorie in Christ Jesus, and pit nae stress on things oʼ the flesh. Eʼen though I mysel micht lay some stress eʼen on things oʼ the flesh. Gin ony ither man thinks to hae ocht to glorie oʼ in the flesh, I yet mair! In circumceesion, an aucht‐day bairn; oʼ Israʼlʼs sons; oʼ Benjaminʼs tribe; a Hebrew oʼ Hebrews; as to law, a Pharisee; As to zeal, persecutin the Kirk; as to richtousness oʼ Law, wyteless. But, whatna things war a gain to me, thae hae I esteemed loss for the sake oʼ Christ! But, in truth, doubtless I am esteemin aʼ things to be loss, for the unco preciousness oʼ the lear oʼ Jesus Christ my Lord; for wham I sufferʼt the loss oʼ aʼ things, and coont them as midden‐orts, that I may win Christ, And may be in him; no haein for my richtousness that frae the Law — but that throwe faith in Christ; the richtousness that is frae God, by faith: To come to ken him, and the pooer oʼ his  Risin‐again, and to be a marrow wiʼ him in his sufferans, bein conform to his death. Gin aiblins, by ony means, I may win on to the “Risin‐again”; that frae amang the deid. No that I hae it noo, or sae sune had been made perfete; but I press on, gin that I may grip haud oʼ that for whilk I was grippit by Christ. Brethren, I, as to mysel allenarlie, am‐na yet reckonin to hae grippit haud; but ae thing I div: forgettin the things ahint, and raxin oot to thae things that are afore, I press on for the gree, for the prize oʼ the biddin (frae on heigh) oʼ God in Christ Jesus. As mony oʼ us, than, as are oʼ fuʼ stature, lat this be oor mind; and gin ye be mindit anither way, God wull mak it plain to ye. Nane‐the‐less, as far on as we hae gotten, lat us resolve to gang on in the same rule. Brethren! be ye followers oʼ me thegither; and tak tent oʼ thae that sae gang, eʼen as ye hae us for an example. For mony walk, oʼ wham I aft tellʼt ye, and noo, eʼen wiʼ tears tell ye: faes oʼ the Cross oʼ Christ! Whase hinner end is destruction, whase god is their wame, and whase glorie is in their shame; wha mind things oʼ the yirth. For oor citizen‐richts are in Heeven, oot oʼ whilk fain look we for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; Wha wull change the body oʼ oor laigh‐estate, to be like to the body oʼ his glorie; conform to the inwart workin, whaur‐by he has pooer eʼen to bring aʼ things intil subjection to his sel. And sae, my brethren, belovʼd and mickle‐langed‐for, my rejoicin, sae staun siccar iʼ the Lord, my beloved! Euodia I entreat, and Syntyche I entreat, that ye be oʼ ae mind, iʼ the Lord. And I entreat ye as weel, leal yoke‐fellow, be ye helpin thae weemen wha, in truth, helpit me iʼ the labor oʼ the Gude‐word; wiʼ Clement too, and my ither marrows, whase names are iʼ the Buik oʼ Life. Be glad iʼ the Lord aye; and again I say, “Be glad!” Lat yere reasonableness be kent to aʼ men: the Lord is at haun. For naething be ye trauchlʼt iʼ yere minds; but in aʼ things by prayer and supplication, wiʼ gean oʼ thanks, lat yere needs be made kent to God. And the peace oʼ God that is aboon aʼ oor thocht, sal keep yere hearts and yere thochts in Christ Jesus. And for the lave, brethren,  As mony things as are leal, as mony things as are honorable, as mony things as are just, as mony things as are pure, as mony things as are bonnie, as mony things as are oʼ gude repute; gin thare be ony virtue whatsoeʼer, gin thar be ony praise, tak ye accoont oʼ thir things. Whatna things ye baith learned and gat, and heard and saw, in me, do ye the same: and the God oʼ peace sal be wiʼye. But I was made to be unco blythe iʼ the Lord, that noo iʼ the end, yere care for me blossomʼd again: thoʼ in truth ye war carin, but wantit opportunity. No that I was in need, am I speakin; for I ken, hoosoeʼer I am, to be content. I ken baith hoo to be brocht laigh, and I ken hoo to hae mair nor eneuch: in aʼ ways, and in aʼ things hae I been instruckit, baith to be fuʼ and to hungʼer, baith to hae ower‐and‐aboon, and to want. I can do aʼ things, by him wha strenthens me! Nane‐the‐less, ye did weel, in haein a co‐stewardship wiʼ me in the distress. Noo ye Philippians ken, that iʼ the beginnin oʼ the Gude‐word, whan I gaed oot frae Macedonia, no eʼen ae kirk had fellowship wiʼ me, iʼ the maitter oʼ giean and takin, but ye only. For eʼen in Thessalonica, ye sent, ance and again, till my need. No that I seek eftir a gift: but I seek eftir the frute that is to increase to yere accoont. But I hae rowth oʼ aʼ things, and mair nor eneuch; I hae been filled, haein frae Epaphroditus the things frae you, a sweet odor, and acceptable offeran, weel‐pleasin tae God. But my God wull mak up for ye ilka need, conform to the riches oʼ his glorie in Christ Jesus. Noo to oor God and Faither be glorie, for evir and for evir. Amen! Salute ye every saunt in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are wiʼ me salute ye. Aʼ the saunts salute ye; in especial they oʼ Cesarʼs hoosehauld. The tender‐love oʼ the Lord Jesus Christ be wiʼ yere spirit! Paul, an Apostle oʼ Christ Jesus, throwe Godʼs wull, wiʼ Timothy, oor brither, To the holie and leal brethren in Christ in Colosse: tender‐love to ye, and peace, frae God oor Faither, We are aye giean thanks to the God and Faither oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ; praying at aʼ times on yere behauf. Hearin oʼ yere faith in Christ Jesus, and the love ye bear to aʼ the saunts. On accoont oʼ the hope that is lyin‐by for ye iʼ the Heevens, oʼ whilk ye heard afore iʼ the word oʼ the truth oʼ the Blythe‐message, That has come to you, eʼen as it is bearin frute and growin iʼ aʼ the warld, sae amang you as weel, frae whatna day ye first heard the sough oʼt, and cam to ken the tender‐love oʼ God in truth: Conform to what ye had frae Epaphras, oor dear fellow‐servant, wha is a leal servitor oʼ Christ for  us; Wha eke made kent to us your love iʼ the Spirit. And for this, we oorsels, frae what day we heard it, cease‐na prayer and seekin, that ye may be filled wiʼ the fuʼ knowledge oʼ his wull, in aʼ wisdom and spiritual discernment; That ye soud walk in sic mainner wordie oʼ the Lord, until pleasin him; in aʼ gude warks bearin frute, and growin in the lear oʼ God. In aʼ micht bein made michty, conform to the micht oʼ his ain glorie for aʼ tholin and patience wiʼ joy. Giean thanks to the Faither, wha gars us to be fit to partak oʼ the inheritance oʼ the saunts in licht; Wha deliverʼt us oot oʼ the pooer oʼ the mirkness, and translatit us intil the Kingdom oʼ the Son oʼ his love. In wham we hae redemption, the passin by oʼ sins. Wha is the likeness oʼ the invisible God, the  first‐born oʼ aʼ the creation. For in him war aʼ things creatit, things in Heeven and things on the yirth, the things seen and the things no seen; whether throns, or dominions, or principalities or authorities — thir aʼ, throwe him, and for his sake, hae been creatit. And he is afore aʼ things, and by him aʼ things haud thegither, And he is the heid oʼ the body, the Kirk; wha is the original, the “first‐born” frae mang the deid; that he may become, amang aʼ, the pre‐eminent. For in him it was the gude‐pleasur oʼ the Faither that aʼ boundless rowth soud dwall; And throwe him to reconcile aʼ things to his sel, makin peace throwe the blude oʼ his cross, whether things on yirth, or things in the Heevens. And you, at ae time bein fremd, and wiʼ enmitie iʼ yere minds by ill warks, has he fuʼ‐reconciled, Iʼ the body oʼ his flesh, throwe his death, to bring ye intil his presence holie, and fautless, and wyteless. Gin at least ye bide iʼ the faith, sterk and steive, and no dung?-?awa frae the hope oʼ the Gude‐word ye heard, that was preached till aʼ the creation ʼneath the heevens; oʼ whilk I Paul becam a servitor. Noo I am blythe to suffer on yere behauf, and am fillin up what was wantin oʼ the Christ‐tribulations in my flesh, on account oʼ his body, that is the kirk: Oʼ whilk I becam a servitor, conform tae the stewardship oʼ God, whilk was gien me for you, to fulfil the word oʼ God. The riddle that was hidden awa frae the ages and the generations, but is at this time made kent to the saunts; To wham God wulled to mak it kent, eʼen the treasur oʼ the glorie oʼ this riddle iʼ the nations, whilk is Christ in you, the hope oʼ glorie. Wham we declare, warnin ilka man, and teachin ilka man in aʼ wisdom, that we soud present ilka man perfete in Christ. To whilk end I am toilin, battlin accordin to his workin, whilk works in me wiʼ pooer. For I wad hae ye ken hoo great a fecht I am haein for ye, and for thae oʼ Laodicea; and for as mony as haena seen my face iʼ the flesh. In order that their hearts may be comfortit, bein wrocht aʼ intil ane in love, eʼen till aʼ the treasurs oʼ the perfete assurance oʼ the mind, till a fuʼ knowledge oʼ the mysterie oʼ God, eʼen Christ. In wham are aʼ the treasurs oʼ wisdom and lear hidden. But I am sayin this, that nane may wyle ye agley wiʼ fleechin words. For gin I be sindry frae ye iʼ the flesh, yet am I ane wʼye iʼ the Spirit, rejoicin, and seein yere orderliness, and the steive biggin oʼ yere faith anent Christ, In sic way as ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, in him be walkin! Bein firm‐rutit and up‐biggit in him, and bein made siccar iʼ the faith, conform till yere teachin; aboundin in thanksgivin. But tak ye tent, least some ane may be makin booty oʼ ye, throwe philosophy and vanities oʼ deceit, conform to menʼs instruction, conform to the warldʼs elements, and no conform to Christ. For in him dwalls aʼ the abundance oʼ the Godheid in form‐oʼ‐body. And ye are made fuʼ in him, wha is the heid oʼ aʼ principalitie and authoritie; In wham ye hae been circumceesʼd wiʼ the circumceesion no wiʼ hauns, iʼ the pittin‐aff oʼ the body oʼ the flesh, iʼ the  “Christ‐circum?-?ceesion”; Bein wiʼ him buryʼt iʼ yere bapteezin, in whilk ye war raised wiʼ him again, throwe the faith oʼ the workin oʼ God, wha raised him frae ʼmang the deid: And you, deid iʼ the sins and uncircumceesion oʼ yere flesh, he has made to leeve again wiʼ him; oot oʼ love forgiean us aʼ offences. Blottin oot the haun‐write again us, in ordinances, that was contrar to us; and took it awa, nailin it to his cross! And haein strippit principalities and pooers, he made a plain spectacle oʼ them, and a triumph ower them thar‐by. Lat nane, than, be condemnin ye anent eatin or drinkin, or in regaird oʼ a feast, or a new‐mune, or the Sabbaths; That are a “shadow” oʼ comin things; but the “body” is Christ. Lat nane twine ye, by a putten‐on humility, like the worship oʼ an Angel; pratin aboot things he “has seen”; swalled up wiʼ the vain importance oʼ a carnal mind. And no haudin steive the heid, oot oʼ whilk the hail body, throwe the joints and union‐bands haein supply, and joinin itsel thegither, is growin wiʼ the growth oʼ God. Gif ye deeʼt wiʼ Christ frae the warldʼs elements, hoo, than (as gin ye war still leevin iʼ the warld), are ye subject to ordinances: “Ye mauna handle,” “ye maunna taste,” “ye mauna touch!” (Whilk are aʼ to come to an end in the usin!) conform to the commauns and teachins oʼ men? Whilk, in truth, are things, in ae view, haein an appearance oʼ wyss?-?heid in aneʼs ain‐devised worship and humility of mind, and ill‐doin wiʼ aneʼs ain body: no in ony honor:— merely a satisfying oʼ the flesh. Gin, than, ye war raised frae the deid wiʼ Christ, seek the things on Heigh, whar Christ is, at Godʼs richt haun sittin. Be determined on things aboon, no on thae oʼ the yirth. For ye deeʼt, and yere life has come to be hid, eʼen wiʼ Christ, in God. Whansoʼer Christ, oor life, sal be seen, your life, than, alang wiʼ his, sal be seen in glorie. Slay, than, yere members, as to things on the yirth: lachery, impurity, passion, base desires, and greed, whilk is eidol‐servin. For whilk things Godʼs angʼer is comin on the bairns oʼ disobedience. In whilk, eʼen ye walkit at ae time; whan ye war leevin iʼ the same. But noo pit ye them aʼ awa: angʼer, wrath, malice, miscaʼin, shamefuʼ talk oot oʼ yere mooth. Speak‐na twafauld ane to anither; haein put aff frae ye the “auld” man, wiʼ aʼ his deeds, And haein putten on ye the “new,” wha is formed anew into knowledge, eftir the likeness oʼ him that creatit him. Whaur naither “Greek” nor “Jew” comes in; circumceesion nor uncircumceesion, fremd ane, Scythian, bond, nor free: but Christ aʼ; and Christ in aʼ. Pit ye on, than, as chosen anes oʼ God, holie and weel‐loʼed, the tender‐affections oʼ compassion, graciousness, humbleness oʼ mind, canniness, patience: Tholin ane‐anither, in tenderness forgiean ane‐anither, gin aiblins ony ane has a compleent again ony; eʼen as the Lord oot oʼ love forgae you, sae do ye. But ower and aboon aʼ thir things, hae ye love, whilk wull bind thegither aʼ things in perfeteness. And lat the peace oʼ Christ be Regent in yere hearts; till whilk ye war bidden, as ae body; and be ye thankfuʼ. Be the word oʼ Christ dwallin in ye richly; in aʼ wyss teachin and admonishin oʼ yersels, in psalms, in hymns, and godly sangs: liltin iʼ yere hearts to God in yere gratitude. And in aʼ things, whatsaeʼer ye be doin, in word or in wark, do aʼ in the name oʼ the Lord Jesus, giean thanks to yere God and Faither throwe him. Wives, submit yersels to yere husbands, as is fittin in the Lord. Husbands, loʼe yere wives, and be‐na set again them. Bairns, be ye biddable to yere parents in aʼ things, for this is weel‐pleasin iʼ the Lord. Faithers, wauken‐na up angʼer in yere bairns, least they be disheartened. Servants, be biddable in aʼ things to yere maisters iʼ the flesh; no by way oʼ ee‐service, as men?-?pleasers, but in aefauldness oʼ heart, fearin the Lord. Whatsaeʼer ye may do, oot oʼ the saul do it, as for the Lord, and no for men. Kennin that frae the Lord sal ye duly receive the gree, eʼen the inheritance: to the Lord Christ are ye doin service. For he that is doin wrangouslie, sal hae returnʼt to him what he wrangouslie did; and thar is nae walin oot oʼ faces. Maisters, do justice and equity to yere servants; mindin that ye too hae a Maister in Heeven. Gie yersels to prayer; takin tent thar‐in, wiʼ giean oʼ thanks. And prayin for us as weel, that God wull unsteek to us a door for the word, to speak the ferlies oʼ Christ, for whilk I hae become a prisoner; That I may mak it plain; eʼen as I am hauden to speak. Walk ye wyssly anent thae ootside;  obteenin the opportunity for yersels; Yere speech at aʼ times bein wiʼ grace, kitchenʼd wiʼ saut; that ye may ken hoo ye soud be giean ilk ane his answer. Aʼ that regairds me, Tychicus wull mak kent tʼye — the weel‐loʼed brither, and faithfuʼ servitor, and fellow‐server iʼ the Lord. Him hae I sent tʼye, for this vera thing, that ye may ken the things regairdin us, and that he micht comfort yere hearts. Thegither wiʼ Onesimus, the leal and weel‐loʼed brither, wha is frae amang ye. Aʼ things here wull they mak kent tʼye. Aristarchus, my marrow in captivity, salutes ye; and Mark, cousin oʼ Barnabas, anent wham ye had instructions. Gin aiblins he comes to ye, gie him welcome. And Jesus, the ane caʼd “Justus”; they bein oʼ the circumceesion. Thir alane are fellow‐workers iʼ the kingdom oʼ God; wha in truth, hae been comforters oʼ me. Epaphras salutes ye, wha is frae ʼmang ye, a servitor oʼ Jesus Christ: at aʼ times warslin in yere behauf in prayer, that ye may be made to staun complete, and wiʼ fuʼ assurance in aʼ things oʼ the wull oʼ God. For I bear witness, that he has unco fainness for ye, and for thae in Laodicea, and thae in Hierapolis. Luke, the weel‐loʼed leech, and Demas, salute ye. Salute ye the brethren in Laodicea; and Nymphas, and the meetin that is in their hoose. And whansaeʼer the letter has been read amang ye, eʼen mak it to be read iʼ the Kirk oʼ the Laodiceans: and that, as weel, the ane oot oʼ Laodicea be read. And say to Archippus: “Tak tent weel to the stewardship ye received iʼ the Lord, that it ye may fulfil!” The salutation oʼ me Paul, wiʼ my ain haun. Mind ye my chains! Tender love be wiʼ ye! Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, to the Kirk oʼ the Thessalonians, in God the Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Tender love to ye, and peace. We are aye giean thanks to God for ye aʼ, namin ye in oor prayers. Never failin to mind yere wark oʼ faith, and toilin in love, and tholin in hope in oor Lord Jesus Christ, afore oor God and Faither. We kennin, brethren belovʼd oʼ God, yere choice. And hoo that oor Gude‐word didna come to ye as tidings in word alane; but eke in pooer and the Holie Spirit, and in strang certaintie; eʼen as ye kent whatna kind oʼ men we schawed oorsels amang ye for your sakes: And ye took paittern eftir us, and eftir the Lord, takin to ye the word amang mickle affliction, wiʼ joy iʼ the Holie Spirit, Sae that ye cam to be a paittern to aʼ the believin anes, in Macedonia and in Greece. For, frae you has soondit oot the Lordʼs word, no alane in Macedonia and Greece, but in aʼ ither pairts, yere faith whilk is to God?-?ward has gane oot; sae that we hae nae need to speak oʼt. For  they, their sels, tell aboot us, whatna sort oʼ comin‐in we had to ye, and hoo ye turned aboot frae eidols to God, to serʼ a God — a leevin reality. And to look for his Son frae Heeven, wham he raised frae amang the deid, eʼen Jesus, wha saves us frae the wrath thatʼs comin. For ye ken yersels, brethren, oor comin amang ye, that it was leal and true. But eftir we had dreed afore, and war treatit in a shamefuʼ way, as ye ken, at Philippi, we war free oʼ utterance in oor God to tell ye the Gude‐word oʼ God, wiʼ muckle strife. For oor coonsellin isna aʼ error, nor oʼ vileness, nor in twafauldness; But eʼen as we hae been lippened by God to be chairged wiʼ the Gude‐word, in siclike mainner div we speak, no to pleasur man, but raither God wha tries oor hearts. For at nae time did we hae flatterin words, eʼen as ye ken; nor made a cloak for self‐seekin. God kens. Nor seekin praise oʼ men, naither frae you, nor frae ithers: thoʼ we had pooer oʼ claimin  support as Christʼs Apostles. Nane‐the‐less, we war cannie amang ye, as gin a nursin‐mother war cherishin her ain bairn. And sae, bein fain for ye, we had been willin to gie ye no the Gude‐word oʼ God only, but eʼen oor ain sauls; for that ye had come to be sae loeʼd oʼ us. For ye mind, brethren, oor toils and sairs: nicht and day toilin, that we micht‐na be a burden to ony oʼ ye, we made kent tʼye the Gude‐word oʼ God. Ye are witness (and God), hoo purely, and richtouslie, and faultlesslie, we carryʼt oorsels amang you wha believe. Just as ye ken, hoo to ilk ane oʼ ye we war like as a faither to his ain bairns, comfortin and heartenin ye, and testifyin; That ye soud walk wordie oʼ God, wha has bidden ye to his ain kingdom and glorie. And for this too we are aye giean thanks to God, that whan ye had frae us the word oʼ the message, eʼen Godʼs message, ye took it to ye, no as manʼs word, but eʼen as it is truly, Godʼs word, whilk is eʼen workin inwardly in you wha believe. For ye took paittern, brethren, eftir the Kirks oʼ God that are in Judea in Jesus Christ — in that the same things ye tholed frae yere ain countrymen that they did frae the Jews; Wha slew baith the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Prophets; and us they persecute, and are displeasin to God, and contrary to aʼ men; And wad hinner us frae speakin to the Nations that they micht be saved, to fill up their ain sins aye; for wrath is comin on them to the hinner end oʼt. But we, brethren, bein taen awa frae ye for an ʼoor — in presence, no in heart — sae muckle the mair socht to see yere face, wiʼ unco fainness. And sae I uncolie desirʼt to come tʼye, ance and again; but Sautan hinderʼt us. For what sal be oor hope, or joy, or croon oʼ oor glorie? Sanna eʼen ye thus be, afore oor God, at his  presence? For ye are oor glorie and oor joy! And sae whan we could nae langʼer lat‐be, we war well‐pleased to be left in Athens alane, And sent Timothy, oor brither and Godʼs servant iʼ the Gude‐word oʼ Christ, to gar ye staun siccar, and comfort ye iʼ yere faith. Sae that nae ane soud be dauntit by their afflictions; for ye ken yersels that we war appointit for the same. For eʼen whan we war wiʼ ye, we tellʼt ye afore, that we soud dree afflictions; eʼen as it cam aboot, and ye ken. And for this cause, nae mair happin ower my fainness, I sent to ken oʼ yere faith, least by ony means the tempin‐ane had tempit ye, and oor toil soud be aʼ in vain! But noo Timothy, comin to us frae you, feshin us gude word oʼ yere faith and love, and that ye kindly hae mind oʼ us at aʼ times, bein unco fain to see us, eʼen as we are fain to see you, — For this cause we are comfortit, brethren, oʼ ye, as to aʼ oor distress and affliction, by yere faith: For noo we hae life in us, gin ye staun steive iʼ the Lord. For whatna thanksgivin cam we gie to the Lord anent ye, for aʼ the joy we rejoice wiʼ afore oor God, because oʼ you; Nicht and day, wiʼ unco abundance, makin petition for the behauldin oʼ yere faces, and makin perfete the things that are wantin iʼ yere faith? But, may it be, that oor God and Faither himsel, and oor Lord Jesus Christ, airt oor way tʼye! That the Lord may mak ye to increase, and be unco abundin in yere love ane to anither, and to aʼ men; eʼen as wiʼ us towards you, For the up‐biggin oʼ yere hearts, to be wyteless in holiness, afore oor God and Faither, at the presence oʼ oor Lord Jesus wiʼ aʼ his saunts. And forby, we entreat ye, brethren, and coonsel ye iʼ the Lord Jesus, that eʼen as ye had frae us hoo ye soud be walkin and pleasin God — eʼen as ye are walkin — that ye abound yet mair and mair. For ye ken whatna chairges we gied ye throwe the Lord Jesus. For this is a thing God desires, eʼen yere holiness; that ye keep frae lecherie. That ye soud ken, ilk ane oʼ ye, to possess himsel oʼ his ain body in holiness and honor. No iʼ the passion oʼ ill‐desires; eʼen as the heathen wha ken‐na God; That nae man gang ayont, and defraud iʼ this maitter his brither; for an avenger is the Lord anent aʼ thir, eʼen as we tellʼt ye afore, and testifyʼt. For God didna caʼ ye to vileness, but to holiness. He, than, that disna heed, disregairds no a man, but God; wha gies his Holie Spirit to ye. But, anent love to the brethren, ye need‐na that I write to ye; for ye yersels are instruckit oʼ God to loʼe ane‐anither. And, in truth, ye do sae to aʼ the brethren that are iʼ the hail oʼ Macedonia. But we entreat ye, brethren, that ye owerflow yet the mair. And that ye ettle to be quate, and mind yere ain affairs, workin wiʼ yere ain hauns, eʼen as we gaʼe ye chairge; That ye may walk honorably toward thae that are oot‐by; and that ye may lack in nocht. But we desire‐na ye soud be ignorant, brethren, as to the faun asleep, least ye be sorrowin conform to the lave, wha hae nae hope. For gin we believe that Jesus deeʼt and raise again, eʼen sae sal God lead oot thae wha fell asleep in Jesus, wiʼ him. For this to you we say, by the word oʼ the Lord, that we, wha are leevin to the comin oʼ the Lord, sal in naegate win forrit afore them wha are faun asleep. For the Lord himsel sal come doon frae Heeven wiʼ a shout, wiʼ an Archangelʼs voice, and a trumpet oʼ God; and the deid in Christ sal rise foremaist. Eftir that, we, the leevin that are left, aʼ at ance, thegither wiʼ them, sal be claught awa in cluds to meet the Lord iʼ the lift: aud sae at aʼ times, thegither wiʼ the Lord sal we be! Sae than, comfort ye ane‐anither wiʼ thir words. But, as to the times and the occasions, brethren, ye need‐na that I write ocht to ye; For ye yersels weel ken that the Day oʼ the Lord sae comes as a thief iʼ the nicht. At siccan times as they may be sayin, “Peace and safety”; than, oʼ a suddaintie, destruction comes on them — as birth‐pangs on a bearin wumman — and in naegate may they escape. But ye, brethren, are‐na iʼ the mirk, that the Day soud come on ye as a thief. For ye are bairns oʼ light; sons oʼ the day; we are‐na oʼ the nicht, nor yet oʼ the gloom. Sae than, lat us no be sleepin, as div the lave, but lat us be wary, and keepin sober. For folk that sleep, sleep by nicht; and folk that mak theirsels fuʼ, by nicht are fuʼ. But we, bein oʼ the day, lat us be eident, haein putten on the prufe‐coat oʼ faith and love; and as a helmet the hope oʼ salvation. For God didna gie us ower to wrath, but to come into salvation throwe oor Lord Jesus Christ. Wha deeʼt for us, that, gin we be waiken, or gin we be  sleepin, we aʼ at ance, and aʼ thegither, micht begin to leeve wiʼ him. And sae, be ye comfortin ane anither; eʼen as ye are doin. But we entreat you, brethren, to be weel‐acquant wiʼ thae wha toil amang ye, and are ower ye iʼ the Lord, and admonish ye; And hae muckle esteem for them for their warkʼs sake. And be ye at peace amang yersels. But we coonsel ye, brethren, admonish ye the disorderly; comfort thae oʼ feebleness oʼ saul; strenthen the weak; thole lang wiʼ aʼ. See to it that nane return ill‐doin for ill‐doin to ony; but aye pursue eftir that whilk is gude, toward ane anither, and toward aʼ men. Be aye rejoicin. Cease na to pray. In aʼ things gie thanks; for this is Godʼs wull in Christ Jesus toward ye. Quench‐na the Spirit. Geck‐na at preachins, But pit aʼ things to the test; and what is bonnie haud fast. Keep awa frae evil, in ony shape. And the God oʼ peace, mak ye perfete in holiness! And may yere hail spirit, and saul, and body, be keepit faultless at the comin oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ! He is faithfuʼ wha caʼs you; wha eke wull perform. Brethren, be ye in prayer for us. Salute aʼ the brethren wiʼ a sacred kiss. I chairge ye by the Lord, that this letter be read to aʼ the brethren. The tender love oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ be wiʼ ye. Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, tae the Kirk oʼ the Thessalonians in God oor Faither, and the Lord Jesus Christ! Tender love to ye, and peace frae God oor Faither and the Lord Jesus Christ! We bude gie God thanks at aʼ times anent ye, brethren, conform tae what is meet; for that yere faith grows uncolie, and the love oʼ ilka ane oʼ ye aʼ, ane to anither, owerflows. Sae that we oorsels are roosin ye iʼ the Kirks oʼ God, in that ye dreeʼd and had faith, in aʼ the persecutions and afflictions ye tholed; A token oʼ the just judgment oʼ God; to the end that ye soud be reckoned wordie oʼ Godʼs kingdom, on behauf oʼ whilk ye suffer. Gif sae be that it is a just thing wiʼ God to gie tribulation to thae wha mak ye tribulation; And to you wha thole tribulation, to gie rest wiʼ us, at the revealin oʼ the Lord Jesus frae Heeven, wiʼ his michty Angels. In lowin fire rendering vengeance on thae wha ken‐na God, and on thae wha mind‐na the Gude‐word oʼ the Lord Jesus. Wha, in truth, sal dree punishment, eʼen everlastin destruction frae the presence oʼ the Lord, and frae the glorie oʼ his pooer. Whansaeʼer he may come to be glorifyʼt in his saunts, and to be a ferlie to aʼ wha believe; for that oor witness to ye was lippenʼd, iʼ that day. To whilk end we are eʼen prayin at aʼ times anent you, that oor God may reckon ye wordie oʼ yere joyfuʼ‐biddin, and fill up aʼ the pleasur oʼ his gudeness, and wark oʼ faith in pooer; That the name oʼ Jesus may be made aʼ glorious in you, and ye aʼ glorious in him, conform to the tender love oʼ oor God and the Lord Jesus Christ. But we entreat ye, brethren, by the Bein‐wiʼ‐us oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, and oor gatherin thegither to him, That ye be‐na sae eithlie tossʼt aboot iʼ yere mind, nor yet be fleyʼt — aither throwe spirit, or throwe discoorse, or throwe letter as frae us — as that the Day oʼ the Lord has sutten‐in. That nae ane may beguile ye in ony way: for that day winna be, except the gaun‐back comes first, and the Man oʼ Sin be made kent, the son oʼ perdition, He wha rises up, and lifts up his sel again aʼ that is caʼd “God,” or that is worshipped: sae that he, iʼ the temple oʼ God taks his seat, settin himsel forrit that he is “God.” Dae ye no mind, that whan I was yet wiʼ ye, I tellʼt ye thir things? And noo ye ken what hauds back his revealin himsel in his fit time. For the mystery oʼ lawless sin dis eʼen noo work; until that whilk hauds back may be taʼen oot oʼ the gate. And than sal be seen the Man oʼ Sin, wham the Lord Jesus “Sal slay wiʼ the breath oʼ his lips,” and sal destroy wiʼ the shinin‐forth oʼ his presence. Eʼen he, whase comin is conform to the inwart workin oʼ Sautan in aʼ michty workin and tokens, and leean ferlies, And aʼ deceitfuʼness oʼ wickedness to thae that are perishin; for that the love oʼ the truth they took‐na ben to them, that they micht be saved. And, for this, God sends them an inwart‐workinʼ oʼ error, that they micht lippen a lee; That they micht be judged, ane and aʼ, wha didna lippen to the truth, but delichtit theirsels in unrichtousness. But we are hauden to gie thanks to God at aʼ times for you, brethren beloved oʼ the Lord, that God made wale oʼ you frae the beginnin, to salvation, by sanctification oʼ the Spirit, and lippenin oʼ the truth. Until whilk he caʼd you throwe oor Gude‐word, to the obteeninʼ oʼ the glorie oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ. Sae than, brethren, staun siccar, and haud firm the lear ye gat, whether throwe preachin, or throwe oor letter. But oor Lord Jesus Christ himsel, and God oor Faither, wha loved us, and gaʼe us everlastinʼ comfort and gude hope throwe his favor, Comfort yere hearts, and up‐bigg ye in aʼ gude wark and word. And for the lave oʼt; pray ye for us, brethren, that the Lordʼs word may be rinnin, and winnin glorie, eʼen as it dis wiʼ you. And that we may be saved frae forritsome and ill men; for aʼ men haena the faith. But faithfuʼ is the Lord, wha wull up‐bigg ye, and gaird ye frae the Ill‐ane. But we hae perswadit oorsels that whatna things we are giean ye in chairge, ye are baith doin and wull do. The Lord airt yere hearts into the love oʼ God, and into the lang‐tholin oʼ Christ! But we chairge ye, brethren, iʼ the name oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, that ye haud awa frae ony brither wha walks disorderly, and no conform to the coonsel ye had frae us. For ye yersels ken hoo ye soud be takin paittern by us; in that we warna disorderly amang ye: Naither, as a free‐gift, did we eat ony manʼs breid; but in toil and sair tholin, nicht and day workin, sae as no to be a burden on ony oʼ ye; No that we hadna authoritie, but that we micht mak oorsels a paittern for ye to paittern eftir us. For eʼen whan we war wiʼ ye, this we gar giean in chairge till ye, “That gin ony man wadna work, naither soud he eat.” For we hear oʼ some walkin amang ye disorderly, workin at naething, yet thrang and forritsome. But sic as thir we chairge and entreat iʼ the Lord Jesus, that, quately workin, they eat their ain breid. But ye, brethren, be‐na wearied in weel‐doin. But gin ony ane isna giean heed till oor word throwe this letter, remark this ane, and be‐na chief wiʼ him, that he may be shamed. Yet esteem‐him‐na as a fae, but coonsel him as a brither. And the Lord oʼ peace himsel, may he gie ye peace aye, and in aʼ ways! The Lord be wiʼ ye aʼ! The salutation oʼ Paul, wiʼ my ain haun; that is a token in ilka letter: sae I write. The tender love oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ be wiʼ ye aʼ! Paul, an Apostle oʼ Jesus Christ, by commaun oʼ God the Faither, and Jesus Christ, oor Lord. To Timothy, my true bairn iʼ the faith: tender love, mercie, peace, frae God oor Faither, and Jesus Christ oor Lord. Eʼen as I entreatit ye to bide still in Ephesus, whilst I gaed intil Macedonia, that ye soud chairge a wheen no to be teachin anither gate, Nor yet giean heed to silly auld tales and endless pedigrees; whilk in truth rin intil nevir‐endin quaistens, raither than a gude stewardship for God that is in faith. But the end oʼ the commaun is love, oot oʼ a pure heart, and a clean conscience, and a leal faith; Whilk some, haein missed the mark, gaed agley into idle havers; Wha wad be teachers oʼ the Law, no understaunin the things they war sayin, or anent whilk they war stoutly affirmin. But we ken that the Law is gude, gin a man mak use oʼt in a lawfuʼ mainner. Kennin this, that to a just man the Law isna laid doon, but to lawless and disobedient anes, ungodly and sinfuʼ, irreligious and profane, slayers oʼ faithers and slayers oʼ mithers, blude‐shedders, Lecherers, sodomites, man?-?stealers, leears, mansworn anes; and gin thar be onything mair, contrar to halesome doctrine; Conform to the Gude‐word oʼ the glorie oʼ the blessed God, whilk was committed to my keepin. Unco thanks hae I to him wha enablʼt me — Christ Jesus oor Lord — in that he esteemʼd me leal, pittin me intil the service, Thoʼ I was ance a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a hater; nane‐the‐less, I gat mercie, for that I had dune it throwe ignorance, in unbelief. But aboon aʼ measur was the tender‐love oʼ oor Lord, wiʼ faith and love; that whilk is in Christ Jesus. Leal the word! and wordie oʼ aʼ takin‐till ane, “That Christ Jesus cam into the world, sinners to save!” oʼ wham a chieftain am I! But I wan mercie on this accoont, that in me, as a chieftain, Christ Jesus micht schaw forth his unco lang‐tholin, for a paittern for thae wha wad pit faith in him for life everlastin. Noo to the King oʼ the ages, uncorruptible, unseen, the Ae God, be honor and glorie for evir and evir, Amen! This chairge gie I tʼye, my bairn Timothy: conform to the prophecies gaun afore on ye, that ye micht fecht the noble war. Haudin lealness and a clean conscience; whilk some castin frae them, hae as to the faith made ship‐wreck; Oʼ wham is Hymeneus and Aylsander, wham I gied ower to  Sautan, that they micht learn no to blaspheme. I coonsel, than, that first oʼ aʼ, supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanks‐gieans, ye mak on behauf oʼ aʼ men: For kings, and aʼ thae in authoritie; that we may lead a quate and peaceable life, godly and douce. This is gude and pleasin iʼ the sicht oʼ God oor Saviour; Wha wad hae aʼ men to be saved, and to come to fuʼ‐kennin oʼ the truth. For thar is ae God, and thar is ae mediator atwixt God and man, himsel man, Christ Jesus; Wha gied himsel up a ransom for aʼ; the testimonie to be borne in its ain fit times. Until whilk I was appointit to proclaim, and to be an Apostle (I say true, I lee‐na!), a teacher oʼ the nations in faith and truth. I coonsel thar‐for, that the men pray in aʼ places, haudin up holie hauns, far frae aʼ wrath and disputins: Iʼ the same way, too, that weemen, in fit cleedin, wiʼ meekness and douceness, be buskin theirsels; no wiʼ braidins, and gowd, or pearls, or braw attire: But — what becomes weemen professin godliness — wiʼ aʼ  gude warks. Lat a wumman in quateness be learnin; wiʼ aʼ submission. But I alloo‐na a wumman to teach, nor to hae authoritie ower a man, but to be in quateness. For Adam first was made, then Eve. And Adam wasna deceivʼt; but the wumman bein deceivʼt, has come to be in transgression. Yet she sal be saved in her bairn‐time, gif they abide in faith, and love, and holiness. It is unco true, “Gin a man seeks for a Bishopʼs place, he seeks a gude wark!” It is necessar, than, that the Bishop be aboon reproach, the husband oʼ ae wife, douce, oʼ sober mind, behavin weel, hospitable, skilfuʼ in teachin, No gien to wine, nae striker; but thochtfuʼ, again contention, no glaumin eftir siller; Bearin rule weel in his ain hoose, haein bairns in submission wiʼ aʼ propriety; For gin ane kens‐na hoo to preside ower his ain hoose, hoo sal he tak chairge oʼ the Kirk oʼ God? No a new convert; least, bein swalled‐up, he faʼ intil the condemnation oʼ Sautan. And mair: he maun hae a gude testimonie frae thae oot‐by, least he fuʼ intil reproach, and the snare oʼ the adversary. And Deacons maun be grave; wiʼ aefauld tongue, no gien to mickle wine, no greedy oʼ cankerʼt gain; Haudin the mysterie oʼ the faith wiʼ a clean conscience. And lat thir, as weel, be first testit; then lat them tak service, bein fund wyteless. The wives, iʼ the same way, grave; no gien to slander; douce, leal in aʼ things. Lat the Deacons be husbands oʼ ae wife, airtin their bairns weel, and their ain hooses. For thae wha weel hae serʼt, win to their sels a gude staunin, and mickle freedom oʼ speech iʼ the faith, that is in Christ Jesus. Thir things I write to ye; lookin forrit to comin till ye sune. But, gin aiblins I soud delay, that ye may ken hoo it is necessar iʼ the hoose oʼ God to conduct aneʼs sel, whilk in truth is the Kirk oʼ the Leevin God, the pillar and grund?-?waʼ‐stane oʼ the truth. And, ayont aʼ doot, great is the mysterie oʼ godliness! He was made kent iʼ the flesh, declarʼt richtous by the Spirit, seen oʼ Angels, was preached amang the nations, was lippened on iʼ the warld, was taen up in glorie! But the Spirit says in express words, that iʼ the hinmaist times, some wull gang agley frae the faith, takin tent to beguilin spirits, and to teachins oʼ demons, Speakin lees in doobleness, seared as wiʼ a het airn iʼ their ain conscience, Forbiddin mairriage, and layin doon abstinence frae meats, whilk God creatit tae be receivit wiʼ aʼ thanksgivin oʼ thae wha hae faith, and ken the truth. For ilka creatur oʼ God is gude, and nane to be cuisten‐aside gin it be receivʼt wiʼ thanksgivin; For it is made holie by Godʼs word and by prayer. Airtin the brethren in mind oʼ thir things, ye sal be a gude servant oʼ Christ Jesus, nouriced wiʼ the words oʼ faith and gude teachin that ye hae closely followʼt. But refuse ye godless and auld wivesʼ tales: and train yersel into godliness. For bodily exerceeses profit but a wee; but godliness is profitable for aʼ things; haen a promise oʼ life, noo and comin. Faithfuʼ the word! and wordie oʼ aʼ receivin. For to this end are we toilin and strivinʼ for that we hae putten oor hope in the leevin God, wha is the Saviour oʼ aʼ men, special oʼ thae that believe. Gie chairge as to thir things, and teach them. Lat nae man lichtlie yere youth, but be ye a paittern oʼ them that believe, in word, in conducʼ in love, in lealness, in pureness. Till I come, gie gude attent to the readin, to exhortin, to teachin. Neglect‐na the gift in ye, that was gien ye throwe prophecie, wiʼ the layin‐on oʼ hauns oʼ the Eldership. Gie thir things yere care: gie yerself to them: that yere progress may be seen by aʼ. Gie gude tent to yersel and to the teachin. Bide in them: for, sae doin, baith yersel sal ye save and them hearin ye. Censure‐na an Elder, but entreat him as a faither; the youngʼer men like brithers: Elderly weemen as mithers; youngʼer weemen as sisters, in aʼ purity. Honor weedows that are true weedows. But gin ony weedow has bairns or oes, lat them first learn to schaw reverence to their ain folk, and to mak a return to their forbears: for this is weel‐pleasin to God. Noo she that is a  true weedow, and desolate, has putten her hope in God, and is gien gude tent to supplications and prayers nicht and day. But she that is gien her sel to pleasurs, is deid while she yet leeves. And thir things gie ye in chairge, that they may be wyteless. But gin ony ane has nae care for his ain, special for thae oʼ his ain hoosehauld, he is denyin the faith, and is waur nor an unbeliever! Lat a weedow be coontit‐in whan she comes to be nae less than saxty year; that has been ae manʼs wife; Weel‐attestit for her gude warks: gif she has brocht up bairns, gif she schawed hospitality, gif she weshʼt the sauntʼs feet, gif she helpit tae in distress, gif she gaed eftir aʼ gude warks. But youngʼer weedows tak‐na in! for whan they grow reestie again Christ, they wull desire mairriage. Haein as their condemnation, that their first faith they turned‐frae. And forby, they learn to be traikin, gaun aboot frae hoose to hoose; aye, and no traikers alane, but tell‐pyats and busybodies, speakin things that soudna be spoken. I desire, than, that the youngʼer weemen mairry, bear weans, guide the hoose, giean nae occasion for the adversary to reproach. For eʼen noo a wheen are gane agley eftir Sautan. Gin ony believin wumman has weedows, lat her be helpin them, and lat‐na the Kirk be burdenʼt; that it may help thae that are true weedows. Lat the Elders that bear rule weel be reckoned wordie oʼ dooble honor; special they wha toil sair in the word and teachin. For the Scriptur says, “A threshin‐ox ye sanna muzzle”; and, “Wordie the toiler oʼ his fee.” Again an elder enterteen ye nae chairge, except “Afore twa or thrie witnesses.” Thae wha are sinners, repruve ye iʼ the presence oʼ aʼ, that the lave may hae fear. I chairge ye, iʼ the sicht oʼ God, and Christ Jesus, and the weel‐lovʼd Angels, that ye tak tent oʼ thir things, wiʼ nae fore‐judgment; and doin naething for the sake oʼ inclination. Lay hauns in haste on nae man, nor hae ye airt nor pairt wiʼ the sins oʼ unco folk. Keep yersel pure! Drink nae mair watir only, but a drappie wine be ye takin, for yere stammackʼs sake, and yere aft illnesses. Some menʼs sins are openly seen, gaun on till judgment; and wiʼ some, they follow eftir: Iʼ the same mainner, gude warks are openly seen; and thae that are‐na sic, canna bide hidden. Lat as mony as are servants under commaun, reckon their ain maisters wordie oʼ aʼ honor; least the name oʼ God and the teachin be spoken‐again. But thae that hae maisters believin, lat tham no lichtlie tham for that they are brethren, but aʼ‐the‐mair do them service on accoont oʼ being believers and belovʼd, partakers oʼ the same gude‐workin. Thir things teach and threep. Gif ony ane differs in his teachinʼ and stauns‐na by halesome words, thae oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine conform to godliness, He is swalled up, skeelie in naething, but donnert aboot quaistens and argle‐barglin oʼ words, oot oʼ whilk come envy, strivins, miscaʼins, ill‐surmisins, Unendin tulzies oʼ men clean?-?corrupt iʼ their minds, and wantin the truth, thinkin that  godliness is gain. But godliness, wiʼ content, is unco gain. For naething brocht we into the warld, naither are we able to cairry ocht oot. And haein meat and coverin, wiʼ thir we sal hae eneuch. But thae wha bude be rich, are faʼin into a temptation and a girn, and mony glaikit and ill desires; whilk ding men into ruin and destruction. For, a rute oʼ ill‐doin is the love oʼ siller; whilk while some followʼt eftir, they war drawn awa frae the faith, and thringed their sels throwe‐and‐throwe wiʼ mony pangs. But you, O man oʼ God! flee frae thir things; and follow ye richtousness, godliness, faith, love, lang‐tholin, meekness. Fecht ye the noble fecht oʼ the faith! lay haud on the ever‐bidin Life, to whilk ye war bidden, and did confess a noble confession fornent mony witnesses. I chairge ye iʼ the sicht oʼ God, wha gies life to aʼ things, and oʼ Christ Jesus, wha confessʼt afore Pontius Pilate a noble confession, That ye keep the commaun  wantin a spot, wantin aʼ reproach, until the appearin oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ. Whilk glorie in its ain times the blessed and only Potentate sal schaw, the King oʼ the kingly, and the Lord of the lordly; Wha alane has immortality, dwallin in licht unapproachable; wham nae man eʼer saw or can see: to wham be honor and dominion for evir and evir. Amen! Them that are rich in this present world, chairge ye no to be prood, nor lippen to the uncertaintie oʼ riches; but on God, wha gies us a rowth oʼ aʼ things to enjoy: To be doin gude, to be rich in warks oʼ nobleness; to be free in impairtin, ready to co‐operate; Layin‐up for their sels a graun fundation for the time to come, that they may lay haud on that that is truly Life. O Timothy! gaird ye what is lippenʼd to ye; avoidin the profane havers and oppositions oʼ aʼ fause?-?named “knowledge”; Whilk some, haudin, hae missʼd the mark oʼ the faith! Tender love to ye! Paul, an Apostle oʼ Christ Jesus, throwe the wull oʼ God, conform to the promise oʼ Life that is in Christ Jesus, To Timothy, my weel‐loʼed bairn: Tender love, mercie, peace, frae God the Faither, and Christ Jesus oor Lord. Thanks hae I tae God, wham frae my forebears I worship wiʼ a clean conscience, that I hae constant mind oʼ ye in my petitions; nicht and day. Bein unco fain to see ye, mindin yere tears, that I may be fuʼ oʼ joy; Bein remindit oʼ the aefauld faith that is in ye, whilk in truth dwalt first iʼ yere granʼ‐mither Lois, and iʼ yere mither Eunice; and I am perswadit in you as weel. And for this cause I pit ye in mind to steer up Godʼs gift that is in ye, throwe the layin‐on oʼ my hauns. For God hasna gien us a spirit oʼ cowardrie, but oʼ pooer, and love, and oʼ a hale mind. Be‐na, than, ashamed oʼ the testimonie oʼ oor Lord, nor yet oʼ me his prisoner; but, co‐sufferin ill wiʼ the Gude‐word, conform to the pooer oʼ God; Wha saved us, and bade us wiʼ a holie biddin — no conform to oor warks, but conform to an allenar purpose and favor — that whilk was gien us in Christ Jesus afore the ages began, But is e‐noo made plain throwe the forth‐shininʼ oʼ oor Saviour Christ Jesus; wha pat awa death, but brocht to licht life and immortality, throwe the Gude‐word: Oʼ whilk I was set as a herald, and an Apostle, and a teacher oʼ the Nations. For whilk cause I dree thir things; but I am‐na putten to shame, for I ken him in wham I hae lippened, and am perswadit that he is michty to gaird what I hae committit to him, to that day. Keep ye the  paittern oʼ halesome teachins ye heard frae me, in faith and love, that whilk is in Christ Jesus. The gude thing in yere keepin, gaird ye by the Holie Spirit, wha dwalls in us! This ye ken, that aʼ they oʼ Asia are gane frae me, oʼ wham are Phygelus and Hermogenes. May the Lord gie mercie tae the hoose oʼ Onesiphorus, for that he aft refreshʼt me, and wasna shamʼt oʼ my chain: But, bein in Rome, eidentlie socht me, and faund me. May the Lord grant to him that he find mercie frae the Lord iʼ that day! and hoo mony times he serʼd at Ephesus, ye ken better yersel. Ye, than, my bairn, be strang iʼ the tender‐love that is in Christ Jesus. And what ye heard oʼ me throwe mony witnesses, the same things commit ye to aefauld men; sic as can eʼen teach ithers. Thole affliction alang wiʼ us, as a gude sodger oʼ Christ Jesus. Nae ane serʼin as a sodger taigles his sel iʼ the affairs oʼ his “leevin”; that he may please him wha summoned him as a sodger. And, gin ane be contestin for the gree, he isna crooned, gin he contest‐na in a lawfuʼ way. The tiller oʼ the grund that toils maun first partak oʼ the frute. Ponder ye what I say; and the Lord wull gie ye discernment in aʼ things. Keep in mind Jesus Christ, oʼ Dauvidʼs seed, raised frae the deid, conform to my Blythe‐Message: In whilk I dree affliction, eʼen to bonds, as an ill‐doer, but Godʼs word hasna been bund. For this cause I thole aʼ things, for the sake oʼ the chosen anes, that they may obteen salvation, that whilk is in Christ Jesus, wiʼ glorie never?-?endin. Faithfuʼ is the  sayin! “Gin we deeʼt thegither, we sal eke leeve thegither. “Gin we dree, we sal eke reign thegither; gin we deny, he too wull deny us; “Gin we be fause, he leal and true wull aye remain! for he canna be fause to his sel.” Oʼ thae things pit them in mind, bearin witness iʼ the sicht oʼ the Lord, no to be battlin aboot words for nae gude, but for the puʼin‐doon oʼ thae listenin. Gie gude tent to present yersel tae God, a workman no tae be putten to shame, portionin‐oot wyssly the word oʼ truth. But shun ungodly, vain haivers; for they wull but bouk intil mair ungodliness. And their words wull spread as a canker; oʼ wham is Hymeneus and Philetus; Wha, in sooth, anent the truth hae gane agley frae the mark, threepin that the Risin‐again is aʼ  by‐past; and are destroyin the faith oʼ some. Nane‐the‐less, the steive fundation oʼ God stauns, haein this seal?-?mark, “The Lord kens his ain!” and, “Lat ilka ane namin the name oʼ the Lord, haud awa frae unrichtousness!” But in a great hoose they are‐na only veschels oʼ gowd and oʼ siller, but eke oʼ wud and oʼ clay; and some for honor and some for dishonor. Gin, than, ane purify his sel frae siclike, he sal be an honorable veschel, purifyʼt, usefuʼ to the Maister; made ready for aʼ gude warks. But the passions oʼ youth div thou flee! and follow on eftir richtousness, faith, love, peace, thegither wiʼ thae wha are waitin on the Lord oot oʼ a pure heart. Frae glaikit and ignorant quaistens haud awa, kennin that they beget strifes. And the servant oʼ the Lord soudna strive; but to be cannie to aʼ; gleg at teachin; ready to thole ill; In meekness instructin thae wha set up their sels as contrar, gif at ony time God gie them repentance, for winninʼ fuʼ knowledge oʼ the truth; And that they soud come to their sels, and win oot oʼ the snare oʼ the Adversary, wha war taen alive by him at his wull. But oʼ this tak ye tent, that iʼ the last days fearsome times wull come. For men wull be lovers oʼ their sels, lovers oʼ siller, boastfuʼ, prood, miscaʼers, undutifuʼ to parents, thankless, unholie. Wantin proper affection, twafauld, slanderers, unrestrained, harsh, haters oʼ the just, Fause anes, reckless, ram‐stam, lovers oʼ pleasur mair nor lovers oʼ God, Mainteenin a shadow oʼ godliness, but castin awa its pooer; frae aʼ thir turn ye awa! For frae ʼmang thir are they wha creep intil hooses, and lead awa witless weemen, happit ower wiʼ mony temptations: Aye learnin, and never able to come intil the fuʼ knowledge oʼ the truth. But in siclike way as  Jannes and Jambres stude up again Moses, sae thir men staun up again the truth: men aʼ corruptit iʼ their mind; and to be rejeckit as regairds the faith. But theyʼse gang on nae mair, for their folly sal be seen oʼ aʼ men, as was the ithersʼ. But ye did closely paittern eftir my teachin, mainner oʼ life, ettlins, faith, lang‐tholin, dreein, Persecutions, sufferins; whatna things happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; whatna persecutions I dreed; and oot oʼ them aʼ the Lord brocht me! But aʼ wha mak choice to leeve godly in Christ Jesus wull be persecutit! But ill men and deceivers wull warsle on their way to the warst, deceivin, and bein deceived. But div ye bide siccar iʼ the things ye did learn, and war lippened?-?wiʼ, kennin frae whatna teacher ye learned them, And that, frae a bairn, ye kent the holie Scripturs, that are able to mak ye wyss to salvation, throwe faith that is in Christ Jesus. Aʼ Scriptur is wiʼ the breath oʼ God, and is oʼ profit for teachin, for convincin, for correctin, for trainin in godliness: In order that the man oʼ God may be perfete, weel‐fettlʼt for ilka gude wark. I chairge ye iʼ the presence oʼ God, and Christ Jesus wha is to judge the leevin and the deid, and by his shinin‐forth and kingdom, Gie oot the word! Press ye in season and oot oʼ season; convince, rebute, entreat, wiʼ a lang‐tholin and doctrine. For thar wull be a time whan halesome teachin they winna thole: but, conform to their ain desires, and haein a yeuck iʼ their lugs, wull gaither‐up teachers to theirsels; And wull turn awa frae hearin the truth, and turn agley to glaikit tales. But be ye watchfuʼ in aʼ things, thole afflictions, do the wark oʼ an evangelist, fulfil yere service. For I am bein  offerʼt, and the time oʼ my settin‐free is at haun. The gude‐fecht hae I fouchten, the race hae I run, the faith hae I keepit! And as for the lave: thar is lyin‐by for me a holie croon, that the Lord the Richtous Judge wull gie me iʼ that day; yet no allenar tae me, but eke tae aʼ thae wha love his shinin‐forth. Gie gude tent to come tae me wiʼ speed. For Demas gaed awa frae me, carin for this present life, and has gane to Thessalonica; Crescens intil Gaul; Titus intil Dalmatia. Luke alane is wiʼ me. Tak Mark, and fesh him wiʼ ye; for he is oʼ use to me iʼ the service. But Tychicus I had sent to Ephesus. The cloak I left ahint at Troas wiʼ Carpus, whan ye come, bring; and the scrolls, in especial the  parchments. Aylsander the coppersmith did me muckle skaith; the Lord wull gie to him conform to his wark. As to wham, be on yere gaird; for he uncolie resistit oor words. At my first hearin, nae man cam forrit to help me, but aʼ forsook me: may‐it‐na be laid to their chairge! But the Lord stude by me, and strenthened me, that throwe me the preachin micht be weel‐kent, and aʼ the heathen micht hear; and I was deliverʼt oot oʼ the mooth oʼ the lion. And the Lord wull deliver me frae ilka evil wark, and bring me safe to his heavenlie kingdom: to wham be the glory for evir and aye! Amen. Salute ye Prisca and Aquila, and the hoosehauld oʼ Onesiphorus. Erastus bade in Corinth; but Trophimus I left ahint, ill, in Miletus. Gie aʼ care to come afore winter. Thar salute ye Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and aʼ the brethren. The Lord be wiʼ yere spirit. Tender‐love be wʼye! Paul, a servitor oʼ God, and an Apostle oʼ Jesus Christ, conform to the faith oʼ Godʼs bidden anes, and knowledge oʼ the truth, that whilk is conform to godliness, In hope oʼ Life‐eternal, that the God wha isna fause promised afore the ages; But has made plain in his ain gude times his word, wiʼ whilk I was lippened, as by the commaun oʼ oor Saviour God, To Titus, my true bairn eftir a co‐ordinate faith; tender‐love and peace, frae God oor Faither, and Christ Jesus oor Saviour. For this end I left ye ahint in Crete, that the things no yet dune ye micht pit in order, and set Elders in ilka citie, as I gied ye orders. Gin ony man is wyteless, the husband oʼ ae wife, haein believin bairns, no wytit wiʼ riot or disobedience. For the bishop maun be wyteless, as the steward oʼ God; no set in his ain wull, no sune vexed, no gien to wine, no a striker, no grippie wiʼ siller; But hospitable, a freend oʼ what is gude, douce‐mindit, just, holie, airtin weel his sel, Keepin sterk haud oʼ the leal word that is conform to the  teachin, that he may be able to exhort iʼ the halesome doctrine, and to convince the contendin. For a hantle are unruly; fuʼ oʼ perfecʼ haivers; deceivers; special they oot oʼ the Circumceesion. As to wham, it is necessar to steek their mouʼs; wha, in sooth, for the sake oʼ siller, are whammlin hail hooses, teachin things they soud‐na. Says ane frae ʼmang their sels, a prophet oʼ their ain:— “Cretans; aye fause; rampin wild‐beass, idle pock‐puddins!” This testimonie is true; for whilk cause repruve them snellie, that they may be hale iʼ the faith. No takin tent to Jewish tales, and commauns oʼ men wha turn their sels awa frae the truth. Aʼ things are clean to the clean: but to the unclean and unbelievin is naething clean: but baith their mind and conscience hae become unclean. God they profess to ken; but iʼ their warks they deny him; bein abominable and dour, and until aʼ gude warks rejeckit. But speak ye the things that conform to the halesome doctrine. Auld men to be tentie, grave, douce‐mindit, hale iʼ the faith; in love, in tholin; The auld weemen, iʼ the same way, in demeanor as becomes holie anes; no giean to slander, nor yet to muckle wine made captive; teachers oʼ what is gude; That they may lead the young weemen to loʼe their husbands, to loʼe their bairns; To be douce‐mindit, pure, workers‐at‐hame, gude, submittin to their ain husbands; least the word oʼ God soud be spoken again. The younger men iʼ the same way, chairge ye to be douce‐mindit; Anent aʼ things schawin yere ain sel as a paittern oʼ gude warks; in yere instructions, in purity, gravity, Halesome speech no to be condemned; that he wha oʼ a contrar mind may be shamed; haein naething ill he can say oʼ us. Servants, be biddable to yere ain maisters; in aʼ things pleasin?-?weel, no answerin‐back, No pilferin, but schawin aʼ gude faith, that they may mak bonnie the doctrine oʼ oor God and Saviour in aʼ things. For the tender‐love oʼ God, wiʼ salvation for aʼ men, has appearʼt, To the end that denyin oorsels as to ungodliness and warldly fainness, we soud leeve in a douce‐mindit and richtous and godly mainner iʼ the present warld; Ready to welcome the blessed hope and shinin‐forth oʼ the glorie oʼ oor great God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Wha gied himsel for us, that he micht rescue us frae aʼ sin, and mak pure for himsel a people oʼ his ain, fuʼ oʼ zeal in gude warks. As to thir things, be ye speakin, and entreatin, and repruvin, wiʼ aʼ authority. Lat nae man lichtlie ye! Pit them weel in mind to submit their sels to rulers and authorities: to be obedient, ready to aʼ gude warks. No to speak ill oʼ ony; no to be contentious: but cannie, schawin aʼ meekness to aʼ men. For eʼen we, at ae time, war glaikit, dour, deceived, hauden wiʼ mony hankerins and pleasurs, leevin on in malice and envy, wordie to be detestit, and hatin ane‐anither. But whan the unco favor and the love oʼ God oor Saviour to man shined oot, No by warks oʼ richtousness we had dune oorsels, but by his mercie he savʼt us, throwe the weshin oʼ the new birth, and a makin‐new oʼ us by the Holie Spirit, Whilk he teemed‐oot on us wiʼ rowth, throwe Jesus Christ oor Saviour; In order that bein declarʼt richtous by his tender‐love, we micht be made heirs, by way oʼ hope, oʼ Eternal Life. Faithfuʼ is the word! and oʼ thir things I wad that ye threep strangly, in order that they wha hae believed in God may be carefuʼ to pit their sels forrit in gude warks. Thir things are gude and profitable to men! But silly quaistens, and pedigrees, and strifes, and argle‐barglins aboot points oʼ the Law, avoid; for they are fruteless and sapless. A promoter oʼ factions, eftir a first and second warnin, refuse. Kennin, that siccan a ane has been turned agley oot oʼ the way, and sins; bein  condemned oʼ his sel. At siccan a time as I may send Artemas to ye, or Tychicus, mak aʼ diligence to come to me at Nico?-?polis; for I hae determined to winter yonder. Set forrit diligently Zenas the writer, and Apollos, that naething be wantin tae them. But lat oor folk, as weel, be learnin in gude warks to pit their sels forrit in needfuʼ services; that they be‐na ungratefuʼ. Aʼ they that are wiʼ me salute ye. Salute ye thae that loʼe us weel iʼ the faith. Tender‐love be wiʼ ye aʼ. Paul, a prisoner oʼ Christ Jesus, and Timothy, oor brither, to Philemon, oor weel‐loʼed, and oor marrow, And to Apphia oor sister, and to Archippus oor sodger‐marrow, and to the Kirk in yere hoose — Tender‐love to ye, and peace, frae God oor Faither and the Lord Jesus Christ. I am gien thanks to my God, aye pittin ye iʼ my prayers: Hearin oʼ yere love and faith that ye hae to the Lord Jesus, and to aʼ the saunts, That the fellowship oʼ yere faith may be zealous in the schawin‐forth oʼ ilka gude thing in ye, until Christ. For mickle joy had I, and comfort, in yere love; for that the tender‐affections oʼ the saunts are refreshed by you, brither; And sae, — thoʼ unco bauldness oʼ speech I hae in Christ to press upon ye what is becomin — Yet I wad raither entreat: bein siccan a ane as Paul, in eild, but noo a prisoner oʼ Christ Jesus. I entreat you regairdin a bairn oʼ mine, wham I hae begotten iʼ my bonds, Onesimus; Him, at ae time oʼ nae profit to ye; but noo unco serviceable to you and me; Wham I send back tʼye; him, that is my ain tender‐affections! Wham I wad fain ettle wiʼ mysel to detain, that, in your behauf he micht do service to me, iʼ the bonds oʼ the Gude‐word. But, wantin word oʼ yere mind, naething was I willin to do; that no oʼ necessity, but oʼ free choice, yere gude soud be. For aiblins for siccan a cause he was pairtit wiʼ ye for a wee, that ye micht hae him back for aye: Nae mair as a servant, but aboon a servant, brither weel‐loʼed — vera specially to me, but hoo mickle mair to you — baith iʼ the flesh and the Lord! Gin than ye coont me as ane wiʼ yersel, tak him to ye, as mysel. And gin aiblins he has wranged ye, or is indebted, the same tae me div ye reckon. I Paul pit it doon wiʼ my ain haun; I wull meet it; thoʼ I say‐na tʼye hoo ye are awn me eʼen yere ain sel. Aye, brither! lat me hae joy oʼ ye iʼ the Lord: refresh ye my tender‐affections in Christ! Lippenin to yere courtesie, I wrate to ye, kennin that ye wull do eʼen mair nor I seek. But, at the same time,  mak me ready a lodgin; for I look forrit, throwe yere prayers, that I sal be gien as a favor to ye. Thar salute ye Epaphras, my prison‐marrow in Christ Jesus, And Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my brither‐workers. The tender‐love oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ be wiʼ yere spirit! Whaur‐as, in a hantle oʼ portions and in a hantle oʼ ways, in auld times, God spak to the faithers by the prophets, At the hinner‐end oʼ thir days he speaks to us by his Son; wham he set forrit for an heir oʼ aʼ things; and throwe wham he made the warlds. Wha, bein the radiant brichtness oʼ glorie, and a perfete likeness oʼ his sel, and uphaudin aʼ things by the word oʼ his pooer — haen made a purifyin oʼ oor sins — sat doon on the richt haun oʼ the Majestie on Heigh; By sae mickle bein his sel aboon the Angels, as he has inheritit a name that is far aboon their ain. For to whilk oʼ the Angels said he at ony time,  “My Son art thou; this day hae I begotten thee”? And again, “I wull be a Faither to him; and he sal be a Son to me”? But at sic a time again as he soud send the First‐Begotten into the warld, he says, “And lat aʼ the Angels worship him!” And oʼ the Angels he says, “Wha maks his Angels be winds, and his servitors flauchts oʼ fire.” But anent the Son — “Thy thron, O God is to aʼ ages; and the sceptre oʼ thy kingdom is a sceptre oʼ richtousness! “Thou hast loʼed richtousness, and scunnerʼd at ill; and for this God has anointit thee wiʼ the oyle oʼ gladness aboon thy marrows!” And, “Thou, Lord, at the fore‐end, did set the fundation oʼ the yirth; and the heevens are the warks oʼ thy hauns. “They sal dwine awa; but thou bides for aye! And they aʼ, as a wearin‐dud, sal end; “And, as a maud sal thou fauld them up; and theyʼse be changed; but thou art aye the same, and thy years end‐na!” But to whilk ane oʼ the Angels has he said at ony time, “Sit thou at my richt haun, till I mak thy faes the fit‐brod oʼ thy feet?” Are‐na they aʼ waitin spirits, sent oot to wait on thae that sal inherit salvation? And for the sake oʼ aʼ this, we soud ettle sair to haud fast the things that war heard, least at ony time we soud slype awa. For gif the word spoken throwe Angels was stieve, and ilka gangin?-?agley and disobedience gat its true recompense oʼ reward, Hoo sal we ʼscape, gif we gie the gang‐by to sae great a salvation; whilk in truth, begude to be spoken throwe the Lord by they wha heard, and to us was made siccar: God bearin co‐witness, baith wiʼ tokens and ferlies, and mony‐fauld warks oʼ pooer, and gifts oʼ the Holie Spirit, conform to his wull? For it wisna to Angels he subjeckit the comin warld, oʼ whilk we are speakin: For ane in ae place bure witness, sayin, “What is man, that thou soud keep him in mind? or manʼs bairn, that thou soud visit him? “Thou did  mak him for a wee, laigher nor the Angels; thou did croon him wiʼ glorie and honor; and did set him ower the warks oʼ thy hauns. “Thou did pit aʼ things subject aneath his feet.” For in makin aʼ things subject to him, naething was left oot that wasna made subject to him: whaur‐as, noo we see‐na yet aʼ things to him made subject. But the Ane wha was “made for a wee, laigher nor the Angels,” div we behauld, eʼen Jesus; crooned wiʼ glorie and honor throwe the pangs oʼ death; that, by the tender‐love oʼ God he might pree oʼ death for aʼ men. For it behoovʼd him, for whase sake are aʼ things, and throwe wham are aʼ things, in leading mony sons to glorie, that the Chieftain oʼ their salvation soud by sufferins be made perfete. For baith he wha maks holie, and they wha are made holie, are aʼ oʼ ane; for whilk cause he isna backward to caʼ them “brethren.” Sayin, “I wull mak kent thy name to my brethren; amang aʼ the thrang wull I sing praise to thee!” And again, “I wull stievely lippen him!” And again, “Behauld!  I and the bairns God has gien me... ” Seein than, that the bairns had pairt in the flesh and blude, he eke in sic mainner had fellowship iʼ the same; that by means oʼ his death he micht ding the pooer oʼ him that had the dominion oʼ death, that is the Adversary; And micht deliver thir — as mony as frae fear oʼ death war aʼ their life under bondage. For no, truly, is he takin haud oʼ Angels; but he lays haud oʼ Abraʼmʼs seed. And sae, in aʼ things he bude be made like his brethren; that he micht be a mercifuʼ and leal Heigh‐Priest in the things oʼ God, to mak a reconciliation for folkʼs sins. For, seein he dreeʼd his sel, and was tempit, he kens weel to rescue them that are in temptation. Sae, holie brethren, the bidden?-?anes oʼ a heevenlie biddin, look weel at the Apostle and Heigh‐Priest oʼ oor profession, Jesus. Wha was leal to him wha made him priest, as was Moses in aʼ his hoose. For he is coontit wordie oʼ mair glorie nor Moses, by as muckle as he wha biggs the hoose has mair glorie nor the hoose. For ilka hoose is made by some ane; but he wha made aʼ things is God. And, indeed, “Moses was leal in aʼ his hoose,” as a steward, for a witness oʼ the things that war to be spoken; But Christ, as a Son ower his ain hoose; whase hoose are we, gin aiblins we haud siccar the freedom oʼ the promise and the glorie oʼ the hope to the end. Whaur‐for, eʼen as says the Holie Spirit, “The day, gin ye may hear his voice, “Harden‐ye‐na yere hearts, as in the bitter thrawartness, on the day oʼ temptation iʼ the desert, “Whan yere forbears tempit me wiʼ a test; and saw my warks forty year. “Sae was I sair vexed wiʼ this generation, and said, ‘Aye gang they agley iʼ their heart, and they divna ken my ways.’ “Sae did I sweer iʼ my wrath, ‘They sal enter‐na intil my Rest!’ ” Tak ye tent, brethren, least at ony time thar soud be, in ony oʼ ye, a dour heart oʼ unbelief, in faʼin‐awa frae the leevin God; But exhort ane‐the‐ither, day by day, eʼen as lang as it is caʼd “the day,” least ony oʼ ye be hardened throwe the glamor oʼ sin. For gin we haud siccar tae the hinner end the beginnin oʼ oor faith, we hae come to be pairtners wiʼ Christ. While it is said, “The day, gin ye wull hear his voice, harden‐ye‐na yere hearts, as in the bitter thrawartness!” For wha wasʼt, thoʼ they heard, caused the bitterness? Na, didna aʼ thae wha cam oot oʼ Egypt by Moses? But wham was he sair vexed wiʼ for forty year? Wasʼt no wiʼ thae that sinned, wha fell iʼ the desert? And to wham swure he that they soudna enter intil his  Rest, but to thae wha war thrawn and dour? And we see they warna able to enter in for unbelief. Lat us than hae fear, least at ony time — thoʼ thar be a promise left oʼ enterin intil his Rest — ony frae ʼmang ye soud come short oʼt. For to us has the Joyfuʼ‐message been gien, eʼen as to them; but the word oʼ their hearin did them nae gude, they no makin their sels ane in faith wiʼ thae that hearkenʼt. For we that hae had faith div enter intil the  Rest; conform to what he has said, “As I did sweer iʼ my wrath, they sanna enter intil my Rest!” thoʼ the warks war aʼ endit frae the fundation oʼ the yirth. For he has said in a place, anent the seeventh day, thus: “And God restit on the seeventh day, frae aʼ his warks.” And in this place again, “Gif they sal enter intil my Rest!” Sae, seein it is left ower for some to enter intilʼt, and they wha afore had the Joyfuʼ‐message deliverʼt to them enterʼt‐na in, on accoont oʼ thrawartness. He still marks oot a certain day, sayin by Dauvid — eʼen eftir sae lang a time as that — juist like as it had been said afore: “The day, gin aiblins ye hear his voice, mak‐na hard yere hearts!” For gin Joshua had gien “Rest” to them, he wadna iʼ that case hae been speakin, eftir thae things, oʼ anither day. Sae thar is bein left ower a Sabbath‐keepin for aʼ the folk oʼ God! For he that enterʼt intil his rest, he eke has restit frae aʼ his warks, as God did frae his. Lat us than gie aʼ tent to enter intil that “Rest”; least ony ane faʼs, iʼ the same example oʼ thrawartness. For Godʼs word is leevin and michty, keener nor a twa‐edged sword, thringin throwe to the pairtin oʼ saul and spirit, oʼ joints and marrow; and gleg at discernin the airtins and ettlins oʼ the heart. And thar isna a creatit thing that can be hidden frae his sicht; but aʼ things are nakit and laid bare to the een oʼ him wham we hae to do wiʼ. Haein than a great Heigh‐Priest, wha has gane up throwe the heevens, Jesus, the Son oʼ God, lat us haud siccar oor confession! For we haena a Heigh‐Priest that hasna a brither‐feelin wiʼ oor weaknesses; but ane wha was tempit in aʼ the likeness oʼ oorsels, yet wantin sin. Lat us, than, draw nar wiʼ freedom oʼ speech to the thron oʼ tender‐love; that we may obteen mercie, and find favor to help us in oor need! For ilka Heigh‐priest, taen frae among men, is appointit for things oʼ God, that he may offer baith gifts and sacrifeeces for sins; As ane wha can marrow weel in his heart wiʼ thae that are ignorant and gane aside; sinʼ he his sel is rinkit roonʼ wiʼ weakness; And on this accoont he bude for his sel, sae for the folk, to be offerin for sins. And nae man taks to him this honor, but is caʼd by God, eʼen as Aaron was. And sae, eʼen Christ magnifyʼt?-?na himselʼ to be made a Heigh‐priest; but raither it was he that spak to him, sayinʼ “My Son art thou; this day hae I begotten thee.” Eʼen as in anither place he says, “Thou, a Priest for aye, iʼ the order oʼ Melchizedek.” Wha, iʼ the days oʼ his flesh, eftir offerin up prayers and entreaties to him wha was strang to save him frae death, wiʼ sair ootcries and tears; and had been  heard for his godly fear. Eʼen thoʼ he was a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things that he tholed; And bein perfetit, becam to aʼ thae obeyin him the fundation oʼ an endless salvation; Haein been addressed by God himsel as “Heigh‐Priest, iʼ the order oʼ Melchizedek.” Anent wham we hae muckle to say, and are sair beset hoo to say it, seein ye are become feckless in hearin. For, eʼen whan ye soud hae come to be teachers iʼ the lapse oʼ time, ye hae need ance mair that ane be teachin you the vera elements oʼ the first principles oʼ the oracles oʼ God; and are gotten to be sic as hae need oʼ milk and no oʼ manʼs meat. For ilka ane takin milk wants skill iʼ the word oʼ richtousness; for he is a wean: But tae sic as are man‐grown, pertains manʼs meat; to thae wha throwe proper use, hae their pooers exerceesʼt to discern baith gude and ill. Thar‐for, lat us leaʼ thir beginnins oʼ the things oʼ Christ, and gang on toward fuʼ growth; no layin ower again the fundation oʼ turning frae deid warks, and oʼ faith toward God. Oʼ the teachin anent bapteezins, and oʼ layin‐on oʼ hauns, and oʼ the Risin frae‐the‐deid, and oʼ eternal judgment. And this wull we do, gin at least God permit. For it isna possible, as to thae wha ance had licht, and had preed the free‐gift oʼ Heeven, and had been made to partak oʼ the Holie Spirit. And had preed the sweet word oʼ God, and the pooers oʼ the warld to come, — And then faʼin awa, ance mair to new‐form them until repentance; seein they are crucifyin ower again to their sels the Son oʼ God, and makin a public shame oʼ him! For the grund, that sooks in the aft‐faʼin rain, and brings forth what they wad fain hae wha till it, receives blessin frae God; But gin it bear thorns and briers, it is no esteemed, and is nar‐haun bein cursʼt; whase end is to be brunt. But we are perswadit better things oʼ you, beloved, eʼen things oʼ salvation, thoʼ we div sae speak. For God is no ill‐deedie to be forgettin yere wark and love that ye schawed forth for his name; in serʼin the saunts, and still serʼin. But we hae mickle desire that ilk ane oʼ ye schaw forth the same perseverin, to the fuʼ confidence oʼ hope, eʼen tae the end. That ye be‐na slack, but followin on eftir thae wha by faith and long‐tholin fell heirs to the promises. For whan God made promise to Abraʼm, seein thar war nane greater to sweer by, he swure by his sel, Sayin, “Certes, in blessin wull I bless thee; and in multiplyin wull I multiply thee!” And sae, tholin patiently, he gat the promise. For men sweer by ane greater; and wiʼ them an aith is the end oʼ aʼ disputin. And sae God, bein muckle mair willin to schaw forth to the heirs oʼ the promise the siccarness oʼ his coonsel, cam in wiʼ an aith. For by  twa unchangeable things, in whilk it wasna possible for God to be fause, a stieve consolation we soud hae, wha fled to grip the hope set afore us; Whilk hope we hae as an anchor oʼ the saul, baith siccar and sure, and comin ben within the veil. Whaur Jesus, as fore‐rinner for us, has enterʼt; wha “was made a Heigh‐priest for aye, iʼ the order oʼ Melchizedek.” For this Melchizedek, king oʼ Salem, priest oʼ God Maist Heigh, that forgatherʼt wiʼ Abraʼm as he cam back frae the slauchtir oʼ the kings, and blessʼt him; Till wham gied Abraʼm eʼen a tenth oʼ aʼ: he bein first, by translation, “King oʼ Richtousness,” and than as weel, “King oʼ Salem,” whilk is “King oʼ Peace,” Wantin faither, wantin mither, withoot pedigree, haein naither beginnin oʼ days nor end oʼ life; but made to be like the Son oʼ God — bides a Priest withoot interruption. And noo think hoo great this man is, till wham Abraʼm gied a tenth oot oʼ the best spoil, eʼen Abraʼm the patriarch! And they, truly, frae amang Leviʼs sons wha are gien the priesthood, hae instructions to tak tithes oʼ the folk, conform to the law; that is, oʼ their brethren, eʼen thoʼ they hae come oot oʼ the loins oʼ Abraʼm! But he wha wins‐na his pedigree frae them, gat tithes frae Abrʼam, and blessʼt him wha had the promises. But, aboon aʼ disputin, the heigher aye blesses the laigher. And here, truly, men wha dee tak tithes; but thar ane taks them wha obteens witness that he leeves. And, sae to speak, eʼen Levi, wha taks tithes, pays tithes throwe Abraʼm: For yet iʼ the loins oʼ his faither was he, whan Melchizedek forgatherʼt wiʼ him. Noo truly than, gin thar war a perfetin throwe the Levitical priesthood (for ʼneath it the folk had the Law gien them) whatna need wus thar for a different Priest to be raised up, “conform to the order oʼ Melchizedek,” and no be named as “conform to the order of Aaron?” For seein thar is a change oʼ priesthood, thar maun eʼen as weel be a change oʼ Law. For he oʼ wham thir things are said has pairt wiʼ a different tribe; frae whilk nae man has gien attendance at the altar. For the truth is siccar, that oot oʼ Judah sprang oor Lord; anent whilk tribe Moses spak naething aboot priests. And still muckle mair is it evident, that, conform to the likeness oʼ Melchizedek, is to be raised up a different Priest, Wha has been made a Priest, no conform to the rule oʼ a commandment dealin wiʼ flesh, but conform to the pooer oʼ a Life for Aye. For it is witnessed, “Thou art a Priest for aye; oʼ the order oʼ Melchizedek!” For truly, a settin‐aside oʼ a fore‐gaun commandment comes aboot, on account oʼ its weakness and want oʼ profit. For the Law brocht naething to perfection; but thar is the comin‐in oʼ a better hope, throwe whilk we draw nar to God. And inasmuckle as it wasna wantin an aith‐takin — For thae priests war made wantin an aith; whaur‐as he wiʼ an aith‐takin, by him that said to him, “The Lord swure, and gangs‐na back, ‘Thou art a Priest for Aye, oʼ the order oʼ Melchizedek!’ ” By sae muckle as this, has Jesus come to be  caʼtion oʼ a heigher covenant. And truly, in lairger numbers hae they been made priests, for that on accoont oʼ death they coudna bide; But he, in that he bides for aye, ever‐constant hauds the priesthood. Sae is he able to sauf to aʼ extremitie thae that come throwe him to God; leevin aye, to intercede in their behauf. For siccan a Heigh‐Priest as this for us was aye meet, wha was holie, innocent, uncorrupt, sindry frae sinners, and made to be aboon the heevens. Wha has nae need, day by day, to be offerin up sacrifeeces, like thae Heigh‐priests, for his ain sins, and than for thae oʼ the folk. For this he did, ance for aʼ, whan his ain sel he offerʼt! For the Law appointit men Heigh‐priests, haein weakness; but the word oʼ the aith‐takin (whilk was eftir the Law) appoints the Son, wha is consecrate for evermair. But, as bringing to a point what we hae said: Siccan a Heigh‐Priest hae we as this, wha is set on the richt haunʼ oʼ the thron oʼ The Majestie iʼ the Heevens; Oʼ the Holie Place, and oʼ the true tabernacle, whilk the Lord pitched, and no a man. For ilka Heigh‐priest is ordeened for the offerin oʼ baith gifts and sacrifeeces; and it was necessar for this ane too, that he soud hae that whilk he micht offer. Gin than the Lord had been on yirth, he hadna been a priest ava; sinʼ thar are thae, offering the gifts conform to the “Law.” Wha eʼen, as a glint and shadow oʼ heevenlie things, are doin service; eʼen as Moses had word whan aboot to finish the tabernacle: “For tak tent,” says he, “that ye mak aʼ things conform to the paittern schawn to ye iʼ the mount.” But noo has he obteened a mair noble ministry, by as muckle as he is the Mediator oʼ a  heigher covenant, whilk is established on heigher promises. For gin the first had been perfete, nae need wad thar hae been for a second. For as wytin them, he says, “Tak tent! the days come, says the Lord, that I wull mak wiʼ the hoose oʼ Israʼl and the hoose oʼ Judah a new covenant. No conform to the covenant I made wiʼ their forbears, iʼ the day I took them by the haun, to lead them oot oʼ the land oʼ Egypt; for it was that they bade‐na iʼ my covenant, and I disregairdit them, says the Lord. “But this is the covenant I wull covenant wiʼ Israʼlʼs hoose eftir thae days, says the Lord, I wull pit my laws iʼ their minds, and write them on their hearts; and I wull be to them for a God, and they sal be for me a folk. “And nae need, ilk ane to teach his marrow, or ilk ane his brither, sayin, ‘Ken ye the Lord!’ for aʼ they sal ken me, frae the smaʼest to the greatest oʼ them. “For I wull be mercifuʼ to their unrichtousness, and oʼ their sins will I be mindfuʼ nae mair!” By this word, “A new covenant,” he made the first ane “auld”: but what is made past use and auld, is passin awa. And eke the first covenant had its ordinances oʼ divine service, and a sanctuary oʼ this present warld. For a tabernacle was plenishʼt; the first, in whilk war baith the lamp‐stead and the table, and the settin‐forth oʼ the breid; whilk is caʼd the “Holie.” But, eftir the second veil, the tabernacle caʼd the “Holie oʼ Holies”: Haein a gowden censer, and the Ark oʼ the Covenant, owerlaid wiʼ gowd, in whilk was a gowden pat haudin the manna, and Aaronʼs wand that bloomed, and the tables oʼ the covenant; But ower aboon it the Cheru?-?bim oʼ glorie, ower‐shadin the Mercy‐seat; anent whilk things it isna necessar e‐noo to speak specially. Noo, when thir things war sae ordeened, intil the first tabernacle gaed aye continually the priests, makin the services: But intil the second the Heigh‐priest alane, ance ilka year; and no wantin blude, whilk he offers for his sel, and for the blinʼness oʼ the folk. The Holie Spirit sae makin it seen, that the gate to the Holiest hadna yet been made plain, whiles the first tabernacle was staunin. Whilk indeed was a likeness for the time noo come; conform to whilk was offerʼt baith gifts and offerans, that canna, as to the conscience, mak him perfete wha offers the service; Bein but eatin and drinkin, and a hantle oʼ purifications, appointit to a time oʼ mair licht. But whan Christ drew nar, a Heigh‐priest, oʼ comin gude things, throwe the better and mair perfete tabernacle, no made wiʼ hauns, that is, no oʼ this creation, Nor yet throwe blude oʼ goats and cauves, but throwe his ain blude he enterʼt in, ance for aʼ, to the Holie Place, haein won Eternal redemption! For gin the blude oʼ goats and bulls, and the assis oʼ a quey, strinklin the defilʼd, sanctifies to the pureness oʼ the flesh, Hoo muckle mair sal the blude oʼ Christ, wha, throwe the ever‐leevin Spirit offerʼt his sel, wantin blemish, until God, purify yere conscience frae deid warks, to the offerin up oʼ a divine service to the leevin God? And for sic a reason is he the Mediator oʼ a new covenant; to the end, that a death haein taen place, for the redeemin oʼ sins aneath the first covenant, thae that hae been invitit may receive the promise oʼ Eternal inheritance. For whaur a covenant is, it is necessar that a death soud come in, on his side wha covenants. For a covenant is made siccar, eftir a death: but it is oʼ nae effeck while the  “covenanter” leeves. And sae, no eʼen the first covenant was consecrate wantin blude. For whan aʼ the commauns war spoken conform tae the Law, by Moses to the folk, takin the blude oʼ the cauves and the goats, wiʼ watir and scarlet ooʼ, and hyssop, he strinklʼt baith the buik and aʼ the folk; Sayin, “This is the blude oʼ the covenant whilk God sent in commaun to you!” Aye, and the tabernacle as weel, and aʼ the veschels oʼ the service, strinklʼt he in like mainner wiʼ the blude. And nar‐haun aʼ things are purifyʼt wiʼ blude; conform to the Law; and, wantin the blude‐sheddin, is nae remission. It was a necessity than, for the imitations oʼ things in heeven to be purifyʼt wiʼ sic; but the heevenlie things theirsels wiʼ better sacrifeeces than thir. For no intil Holies made‐wiʼ?-?hauns did Christ gang in — that war but figures oʼ the true Holies — but intil Heeven itsel, noo to come plainly afore the face oʼ God for us. Nor yet that aft‐times soud he be offerin his sel; like as the Heigh‐priest enters the Holie‐Place, year by year, wiʼ ithersʼ blude. Else had it been needfuʼ for him aften to suffer, frae the beginnin aʼ the warld. But noo, ance at the end oʼ the time has he been schawn, for the settin‐by oʼ sin, throwe his sacrifeece. And, inasmuckle as it is laid up for men ance to dee, and eftir this the Judgment, Sae Christ, haein ance for aʼ been offerʼt, and carryʼt the sin oʼ mony, sal appear a second time, apairt frae sin, to thae that fain wait for him, for their salvation. For the Law, wiʼ a shadow oʼ the gude things to come, and no the perfete likeness oʼ the things their sels, canna wiʼ thae sacrifeeces offerʼt up year by year aye, mak perfete them that draw nar. For than wadna they quat bein offerʼt? for they worshippin, bein  ance for aʼ purifyʼt, wad hae nae mair conscience oʼ sins! But, in them, is a bringin‐back to mind oʼ sins, year by year. Impossible isʼt for blude oʼ bulls and goats to tak awa sins! Whaur‐for, comin intil the warld, he says, “Sacrifeece and offeran thou willest‐na, but a body didst thou prepare for me. “In hail brunt‐offerans, and offerans for sins, thou didst‐na joy; “Than said I, ‘Behauld, I am come — (at the heid oʼ the buik it is written oʼ me) — to do thy wull, O God!’ ” Aboon, sayin, “Sacrifeeces and offerans, and haill brunt‐offerans, and offerans for sin thou willest‐na, naither didst joy in” — sic as, conform to the Law, are offerʼt; Than did he say, “Behauld! I am come to do thy wull!” He taks awa the first, that he may mak siccar the second. By the whilk wull we are made holie, throwe the offerin oʼ the body oʼ Jesus Christ ance for aʼ. And ilka priest stauns, in truth, day eftir day servin, and offerin ower again the same sacrifeeces; whilk, truly, can never tak awa sins; But he, haein offerʼt ae sacrifeece for sins for evermair, sut doon at Godʼs richt haun; Frae this waitin, “till his faes be made the fit‐brod oʼ his feet.” For by the Ae‐offeran he has perfetit for evermair them that are sanctifyʼt. And the Holie Spirit himsel bears witness for us; for eftir he had said, “This is the covenant I wull covenant wiʼ them eftir thae days,” says Jehovah, “Giean my laws on their hearts, I wull write them on their minds;” He says mair: “Their sins and their ill‐deediness wull I naewise mind ony mair.” Noo, whaursaeʼer they are remittit, thar is nae mair offeran for sin needfuʼ. Haein than, brethren, bauldness oʼ speech to enter intil the Holiest by the blude oʼ Jesus, Whilk enterin‐in he has consecrate for us, a new way, and a way oʼ Life, throwe the veil (that is, his flesh), And haein sic a great Heigh‐Priest ower the hoosehauld oʼ God, Lat us come nar, wiʼ leal hearts, in the fuʼ confidence oʼ faith; haein been strinklʼt in oor hearts frae an ill conscience; and haein been weshʼt in oor bodies wiʼ pure watir; Lat us haud siccar the confession oʼ oor hope wiʼ nae wafflin; for leal is he that did undertak. And lat us think upoʼ ane‐anither, for an encouragin to love and gude warks: No lattin‐faʼ the forgatherin oʼ oorsels, eʼen as it is the way wiʼ some; but, perswadin aye; and sae muckle the mair, as ye see the dawin oʼ the day. For gif we gang on sinnin eftir receivin the knowledge oʼ the truth, nae langʼer, for sin, is thar remainin a sacrifeece; But a fearsome lookin‐forrit tae judgment, and a sautness oʼ fire, that sal devoor the enemy. Ane that set aside Mosesʼ Law, deeʼt withoot pitie, “afore twa or thrie witnesses.” Oʼ hoo muckle sairer punishment, think ye, sal he be hauden wordie, wha trampit the Son oʼ God under fit; and held as an unclean thing the blude oʼ the covenant by whilk he is consecrate, and did wantonly miscaʼ the Spirit oʼ love? For we ken wha said, “To me perteens avenging; I wull recompense!” and again, “Jehovah wull judge his folk.” It is a fearsome thing to faʼ intil the hauns oʼ a Leevin God! But mind‐ye‐na the days gane by, in whilk, ance ye gat licht, ye tholed an unco fecht oʼ sufferans? Some pairt that ye war made, wiʼ miscaʼin and griefs, a ferlie for men; and some pairt that ye war made marrows oʼ thae that war sae dune till. For ye took the pairt oʼ thae in bonds, and tholed the poindin oʼ yere gear wiʼ joy, kennin that ye hae for yersels better and ever‐bidin gear. Ye maunna cast awa, than, yere bauldness oʼ speech; whilk in truth has unco reward! For ye hae need oʼ patience, that haein dune Godʼs wull, ye may win the promise: For yet, “A wee while, fleetin, fleetin! the Comin Ane sal come, and no delay! “But the richtous ane by faith sal leeve; but gin ye gang back, my saul delichts‐na in him!” But we are‐na oʼ them wha gang back to perdition; but oʼ faith, to the salvation oʼ the saul. Noo faith is gruppin the substance oʼ things lookit for; the confidence oʼ raal‐things no yet seen. For thar‐in the Elders had gude‐witness borne them. Throwe faith we come to ken the warlds war orderʼt by the words of God, sae as that whilk is seen was made oot oʼ what was seen‐na. Throwe faith Abel offerʼt to God a mair perfete sacrifeece than Cain; by whilk he obteened testimonie that he was richtous, God testifying anent his gifts: and throwe it, though he deeʼt, he is still speakin. Throwe faith Enoch was translatit sae as no to see death, and was seen‐na, for God had translatit him; for afore the translation he had testimonie borne to him that he had been weel‐pleasin to God. But, wantin faith, it isna possible to be weel‐pleasin to him; for he that comes to God maun needs hae faith that he is, and that to thae that seek him a Rewarder is he. Throwe faith Noah, being tellʼt oʼ things as yet no seen, wrocht‐on by godly fear, made ready an ark to the savin oʼ his hoosehauld; throwe whilk he condemned the warld, and becam heir oʼ the righteousness oʼ faith. Throwe faith Abraʼm — he wha was tellʼt — obeyʼd to gang till a place he was to hae for a heritage; and gaed oot, no weel‐kennin whaur he was gaun. Throwe faith he bade day‐by‐day iʼ the Land oʼ Promise, as in a fremd land; bidin in tents, wiʼ Isaac and Jaucob, joint‐heirs oʼ the same promise: For he was waitin for the Citie wiʼ fundations, biggit, and planned by God. Throwe faith eʼen Sarah her sel had strength to conceive, whan she was ayont age: seein that she was haudin him as faithfuʼ that had promised. And sae, eʼen frae ane was thar born — and him as he war deid — “as mony as the starns oʼ the sky in their thrang, and as the sand by the lip oʼ the sea; no to be numberʼt.” And conform to faith, deeʼt aʼ thir; no haen their sels grippit the promises, but seein them far awa, and salutin them, and confessin that they their sels war fremd anes, and lodgers on the yirth. For they that say sic things, mak it plain to be kent that they are seekin a land oʼ their ain. For gin they had been thinkin aye oʼ the land they came frae, they micht hae had opportunity oʼ returnin: But noo they look for a better land, that is a heevenlie ane; whaur‐for God isna ashamed oʼ them to be socht till as their God; for he did prepare for them a Citie. Throwe faith Abraʼm when he was testit, offerʼt up Isaac; aye, he wha blythely acceptit the promises, was offerin‐up his ae and only son; Oʼ wham it was said, “Thar sal be caʼd a seed tae thee in Isaac.” Reckonin that God could raise him again, eʼen frae ʼmang the deid; frae whilk he, in a likeness, wan him back again. Throwe faith Isaac gied blessin to Jaucob and Esau, speakin oʼ comin things. Throwe faith Jaucob, whan he cam to dee, blessʼd baith the sons oʼ Joseph; and “worshippʼt, loutin doon on the heid oʼ his staff.” Throwe faith Joseph, whan his end cam nar, spak oʼ the gaun oot oʼ the sons oʼ Israʼl, and gaʼe commaun anent his banes. Throwe faith Moses, whan he was born, was keepit hidlin thrie month, for that they saw he was an unco bonnie wean, and fearʼt‐na the orders oʼ the king. Throwe faith Moses, whan he was grown, wadna be caʼd “Son oʼ Pharaohʼs dochter”; Makin choice raither to dree wiʼ the folk oʼ God their ill‐treatment, than to be enjoyin for a wee the pleasurs oʼ sin. Reckonin the reproach oʼ the Anointit Ane as unco better than aʼ the gear oʼ Egypt; for he was lookin awa to the giean oʼ the reward. Throwe faith he left Egypt ahint, no fearin the angʼer oʼ the king; for he tholed, as behauldin him wha is unseen. Throwe faith he institutit the Pasche, and the strinklin oʼ blude; that he that destroyʼt the first‐born soudna be touchin them. Throwe faith they gaed athort the Red Sea as on dry grunʼ; whilk the Egyptians, ettlin to do, war whammlʼt ower. Throwe faith the waʼs oʼ Jericho fell doon, haein been rinkit roonʼ for seeven days. Throwe faith Rahab the courtesan perishʼt‐na wiʼ thae that war disobedient, haein welcomed the spies wiʼ peace. And what mair can I say? for time wad fail me tellin oʼ Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; oʼ Dauvid too, and Samuʼl, and the prophets; Wha, throwe faith prevailed ower kingdoms, wrocht richtousness, obteened promises, dang the mooth oʼ lions. Quenched the lowin oʼ fire, escapit the mooth oʼ the sword, frae fecklessness raise to strenth, waxʼt michty in war; turned to flicht armies oʼ fremʼd anes. Weemen gat back their deid, raisʼt to life; and some war tortured, no acceptin conditions oʼ deliverance, that they micht come to a better Risin‐again. Ithers war tried wiʼ mockins and clourins; aye, mair; wiʼ fetters and dungeons: They war staned, war sawn sindry, war tempit, war murderʼd wiʼ sword; they gaed aboot rowʼt in sheepskins and goat‐hides, bein in poortith, dool, and misery. The warld  wasna wordie oʼ them; wanderin on muirlands and mountains, bidin in dens and caves oʼ the yirth. And thir aʼ, thoʼ they had witness to their faith, obteenʼd‐na, their sels, the promise. God haein aforehaun providit better things for us, that no sindry frae us soud they be perfetit. Sae, seein we hae aʼ aboot us sic an unco clud oʼ witnesses — drappin ilka taiglement, and the dawtit sin that eithlie rinks us roond, lat us rin, perseverin, iʼ the race set afore us; Lookin‐awa till oor Leader?-?Prince and Perfeter, Jesus; wha for the joy held afore him,  tholed the cross, and lichtlied the shame; and on Godʼs richt haun has taen his seat. For, think ye oʼ him, wha has tholed sic gainsayin oʼ sinners again himsel, least ye be forfouchten, and yere sauls be faint. Ye hae‐na yet resistit tae blude, battlin again sin! And ye hae clean forgotten the avisement that speaks till ye as to bairns: “My son, lichtlie‐ye‐na the chastenin oʼ the Lord, naither faint ye when ye are repruvʼd oʼ him; “For the Lord chastens the ane he loʼes, and lays stripes on ilka son he welcomes hame.” For the experience‐sake, thole ye; for God deals wiʼ you as wiʼ sons; for wha is a son, and no exerceesʼd oʼ his faither? But gin ye are ootside oʼ aʼ exerceese, oʼ whilk aʼ hae their portion, than are ye bastards and no “sons.” And mair: faithers oʼ oor flesh had we to exerceese us, and we gied them reverence; sal‐we‐na muckle raither submit oorsels to the Faither oʼ oor spirits, and leeve? They, certainlie, for a wheen days, exerceesʼd us, conform tae what seemed to them gude; but he conform tae what is best, that we micht partak oʼ his holiness. Yet nae exerceesin, for the time present, seems a blytheness, but a sorrow; natheless, eftirhaun, to thae wha hae been thar‐by exerceesʼd, it gies peacefuʼ frutes oʼ richtousness. Sae, “The feckless hauns and palsied knees rax oot; “And mak straucht fit‐roads for yere feet”; that what is gleyʼd be‐na thrawn‐oot, but be raither made hale. Follow peace wiʼ aʼ: and holiness; wantin whilk nae man sal see the Lord. Takin tent gif thar be ony man faʼin ahint frae the tender‐love oʼ God, “least ony rute oʼ bitterness springin up” be makin bitterness, and sae mony corruptit: Ony lecherer; or ony ungodly ane as Esau, wha for the sake oʼ ae meal oʼ meat, gied up his “first‐born” richt. For ye ken that, eʼen aftir that was dune, he fain wad hae the blessin, but was rejeckit; for he faund nae turnin again, thoʼ he socht it wiʼ unco tears. For ye hae‐na come to the lowin and devoorin fire, to mirk, and gloom, and tempest. And a peal oʼ a bugle‐horn, and a sound oʼ spoken words; frae whilk thae wha heard pled no‐tae?-?hear‐them ony mair; For they couldna thole what was bein laid doon, “And, gin a beasʼ may touch the mountain, it maun be staned!” And sae awesome was that whilk was seen, that Moses said, “I am unco fleyʼd; and trimle!” But ye are come nar till Zionʼs mountain, and tae the Citie oʼ the Leevin God, a Heevenlie Jerusalem; and till hosts oʼ rejoicin Angels; And to God the Judge oʼ aʼ; and to the spirits oʼ richtous anes made perfete; And till a Mediator oʼ a new Covenant, Jesus; and to the strinklin oʼ blude, sair‐pleadin mair than Abel! Tak ye tent that ye rejeck‐na him that speaks! for gin they escapʼt?-?na wha rejeckit him wha on yirth was warnin them, hoo muckle less sal we escape, gin we turn oorsels awa frae him wha warns us frae Heeven! Whase voice did shake the yirth; but noo has he said, “Yet ance mair I wull shake, no the yirth alane, but heeven as weel!” And this: “ance mair” points to the takin awa oʼ thae things that can be shucken, as oʼ things that hae been formed; that thae may remain that canna be shucken. And sae, seein we are to hae a kingdom that canna be shucken, lat us hae lovin‐favor, that we may render service weel‐pleasin until God, wiʼ reverence and godly fear. For oor God is a devoorin fire. Lat britherly love aye staun. Forget‐na to enterteen fremd anes; for sae some hae takin to them Angels, unkent. Bear in mind thae that are in bonds, as bein in bonds wiʼ them; and thae dreein ill‐treatment as eʼen yersels bein iʼ the body. Lat mairriage be hauden in honor oʼ aʼ, and lat the bed be pure; for lecherers and adulterers God wull judge. Lat yere life no be iʼ the way oʼ loeʼin siller; bein content wiʼ what ye hae; for he has said, “In naegate wull I leaʼ ye! Na, in naegate wull I forsake ye!” Sae that, takin heart, we may say, “The Lord is my freend, and Iʼse be‐na fleyʼt; what sal man do to me?” Keep in mind thae wha are airtin ye; wha speak to ye the words oʼ God; the ootcome oʼ whase life seein, follow ye their faith! Jesus Christ, yestreen and the day the same, and for evermair! Be‐na carryʼt awa wiʼ mony and and unco teachins, for it is graun to hae the heart made siccar wiʼ favor and love; no wiʼ meats, whaur‐in they that hae fashʼd theirsels hae gotten nae profit. We hae an altar, oʼ whilk they hae nae richt to partak, wha serʼ iʼ the Tabernacle. For the bodies oʼ thae beass whase blude is cairryʼt within the Holie Place by the Heigh‐priest, are brunt  ayont the camp. And sae Jesus, that he soud sanctify the folk wiʼ his ain blude, sufferʼt ayont the ports. Lat us than gang oot to him ayont the camp, bearin miscaʼin for his sake! For here we hae nae ever‐bidin Citie, but are seekin oor way till ane to come. Throwe him, than, lat us be offerin‐up a “sacrifeece oʼ praise” aye to God; whilk is “the frute oʼ oor lips,” confessin to his name. But, oʼ doin gude, and oʼ fellowship, forget na; for wiʼ sic sacrifeeces as thir, God is weel‐pleased. Obey them that hae the airtin oʼ ye, and gie‐in to them; for they are takin tent for yere sauls, as haein an accoont to gie; that they may do siclike wiʼ joy, and no wiʼ dool; for that war nae profit for you! Pray for us; for we are perswadin oorsels that we keep a gude conscience; in aʼ things ettlin to leeve honorably. And muckle mair div I entreat ye to do siclike; that wiʼ aʼ the mair speed I may be restorʼt tʼye. Noo the God oʼ peace, that led up frae amang the deid oor Lord Jesus, the Great Shepherd oʼ the sheep, throwe the blude oʼ the ever‐bidin covenant, Mak ye perfete in ilka gude thing for the workin oʼ his wull, doin in ye that whilk is weel‐pleasin afore his face, throwe Jesus Christ: tae wham be glorie for evir and evir! Amen. But I entreat ye, brethren, bear wiʼ the word oʼ coonsel; for eʼen wiʼ few words I wrate tʼye. Ken‐ye‐na that oor brither Timothy is set free? wiʼ wham, gin he come sune, I wull see ye. Salute aʼ thae that hae the airtin oʼ ye, and aʼ the saunts. They oʼ Italie salute ye. Gude favor be wiʼ ye aʼ. Amen. James, a servant oʼ God, and oʼ the Lord Jesus Christ, tae the Twalʼ Tribes oʼ the Dispersion; joy! Aʼ joy coont it, my brethren; whan ye come intil mony trials. Comin to ken that the testin oʼ yere faith works oot lang‐tholin. But let lang‐tholing hae its perfeteness, sae as ye may be perfete and complete, wanting in naething. Gin ony oʼ ye want wisdom, lat him be seekin frae God, wha gies in rowth till aʼ, and wytes‐na; and it sal be gien him. But lat him seek in faith, wiʼ nae switherin; for he wha has switherin doots, is like a sea‐wave, caʼd wiʼ the wind, and tossʼd wiʼ the storm. For lat‐na siccan a man think he sal hae onything oʼ the Lord: He, wiʼ a twafauld mind, unsiccar in aʼ his ways! Lat the lowly brither joy at his uplifting; But the rich in his bein brocht laigh; for, as the bloom oʼ the gerss he is to pass awa. For uprises the sun, wiʼ its birsʼlin heat, and birsles the gerss; “and its blume faʼs awa,” and the ee‐sweetness and beauty oʼ its face is gane! eʼen sae the rich man dwines awa in his ways. Happy he wha tholes trial! for, sae being appruvʼt, he sal hae a croon oʼ Life, promised oʼ the Lord to thae that loʼe him! Lat nae ane, whan under trials, sae, “I am tempit oʼ God!” for God is naither tempit wiʼ sin, nor sae tempts he ony ane. But ilk ane is  tempit, whan by his ain desires he is wheedlʼt awa and enticed. And the desire, haein conceived, brings forth sin; but the sin, whan aʼ is dune, brings forth death! Be‐ye‐na deceivʼt, brethren belovʼd! Ilka gude grant, and ilka perfetit gift is frae Aboon, comin doon frae the Faither oʼ lichts; wiʼ wham is nae unsiccarness, nor shadow oʼ gaun back. Oʼ his ain wull begat he us wiʼ the word oʼ truth, that we soud be like first‐frutes oʼ his creation. Ye ken this, my brethren belovʼd! But let ilka man be gleg to hear, backwart to speak, refusin to be angʼerʼt. For manʼs angʼer works‐na‐oot Godʼs richtousness. Sae than, pittin by aʼ vileness and owercome oʼ wickedness, tak till ye in meekness the inborn word, that is able to save yere sauls. But become ye word‐doers, and no word‐hearers alane, deceivin yere ain sels. For, gin ane is a word‐hearer, and no a word‐doer, he is but like a man seein his born face in a keekin‐gless. He sees his sel, and awa he is gane: and belyve he minds‐na what sort he was like! But he wha obteens a closer sicht intil a better and perfete rule, a rule oʼ libertie, and taks aye heed thare‐till, bein no a hearer forgettin, but a wark‐doer, this ain is blessʼt in his doin. Gin ony ane thinks to be doin religious service, and commauns‐na his tongue, but mislippens his ain heart, this aneʼs religious service is nocht ava. The service oʼ religion, pure and perfete afore oor God and Father is this: To be visitin faitherless and widows iʼ their dool, to keep his sel unstained frae the warld. My brethren, div ye haud by the faith oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord oʼ Glorie, iʼ the maitter oʼ respect oʼ persons? For gin aiblins thar come intil yer kirk a man wiʼ rings oʼ gowd, and braw cleedin; and thar come in as weel, ane in poortith, wiʼ claes unclean; And ye soud spy him wearin the braw cleedin, and say, “Ye sit here in a gude place!” and to the ane in poortith soud say, “Ye staun there!” or “Sit ye aneath my fit‐brod!” Are‐ye‐na than dividit amang yersels, and become judges haein unjust thochts? Hearken, my beloved brethren! Hasna God taen the puir oʼ the warld to be rich in faith, and to hae the kingdom he has promised to thae that loʼe him? But ye lichtlie the puir ane. Are‐na the rich haudin ye doon? and theirsels harl ye afore judgment‐seats? Are‐they‐na miscaʼin the wordie name whilk is placed upon ye? Gin than, ye fulfil the law, the royal ane, conform to the Scripturs, “Ye sal loʼe yere neebor as yersel,” weel are ye doing! But, gin ye schaw walin oot oʼ persons, ye are committing sin, and are fund guilty by the law as ill‐doers. For whasae may keep the hail law, and yet stoiter in ae thing, has become guilty oʼ aʼ. For he wha said, “Ye maunna commit adultery,” said as weel, “Ye maunna commit murder.” Noo, gin ye commit nae adultery, but are committin murder, ye hae become a breker oʼ the law. Sae be ye speakin, and sae be ye doing, as men throwe a law oʼ liberty to be judged! For judgment, wantin mercy, is for him that gied nae mercy; and mercy glories again judgment! What the profit, my brethren, gin ane says he has faith, but has nae warks? Isʼt possible for this aneʼs faith to save him? Gif aiblins a brither or sister be bare, and wantin oʼ daily meat, But ane oʼ ye soud say till them, “Be ye gaun in peace! be ye gettin warmed and gettin meat!” but soudna gie them the thing necessar for the body: what the profit? In sic mainner, eʼen the faith, unless aiblins it has warks, is deid by itsel. But ane wull say, “Ye hae faith, and I hae warks; lat me see yere faith sindry frae yere warks, and I wull lat ye see, by means oʼ my warks, my faith!” Ye believe “God is  Ane”; weel are ye doin! The demons, too, believe, and trimmle. But, wull ye learn, O vain man! that faith, sindry frae warks, is barren. Wasna Abraʼm oor faither declarʼt richtous throwe warks, whan he gied up his son on the altar? See‐ye‐na that his faith was workin in his deeds? and by his deeds his faith was ripened? And the Scriptur was fulfilled whilk said, “And Abraʼm believed God; and it was reckoned till him as richtousness,” and “Freend oʼ God” was his name. Div ye no see that by means oʼ warks a man is declarʼd richtous, and no by faith allenarlie? And, in siclike mainner, Rahab the courtesan too, was she no by warks declarʼd richtous, whan she gae welcome to the messengers, and set them forth anither gate? For eʼen as the body, sindry frae the spirit, is deid; sae thus faith, sindry frae warks, is deid. Become‐na, mony oʼ ye, teachers, my brethren; kenninʼ that we sal hae the heavier judgment. For in mony‐fauld things ane‐and‐aʼ aft stoiter. Gin ony ane stoiters‐na in his  words, the same is a weel‐ripened man, able to bridle the hail body. We pit bits intil horsesʼ mouʼs, that we may airt them; and their hail body we turn aboot. Mark too the ships; muckle as they are, and are cairryʼt by rouch winds, yet are they airtit aboot wiʼ a vera wee helm, whaureʼer the steerer may wuss. Sae the tongue is a wee pairt, and yet boasts oʼ muckle things. Look, hoo a wee fire lunts sae great a wud! And the tongue is a fire, a warld oʼ wickedness! The tongue is amang oor pairts as that whilk defiles the hail body; and sets a‐lowe the wheel oʼ oor nateral life, and is set a‐lowe by hell! For ilka natur oʼ beass and oʼ birds, and oʼ crowlin‐things, and things iʼ the sea, are tamed, and hae been tamed, by human‐kind. But the tongue nane oʼ mankind can tame: a restless ill, fuʼ oʼ deidly pushion: Whaur‐by we bless God the Faither; and whaur‐by we ban men, made conform to Godʼs likeness. Oot oʼ the ae mooth comes forth blessin and cursin! It isna bonnie, my brethren, for sic things to be! Dis the fountain, oot oʼ the same mooth, teem oot the sweet and the bitter? Can a fig tree, my brethren, bring forth olives? or a vine gie figs? naither can saut watir yield sweet. Wha is wyss and weel‐learʼd amang ye? let him schaw oot oʼ a gude life his warks, in a wyss meekness. But gin ye hae bitter selliness and rivalry iʼ yere hearts, boast‐na yersels; and schaw‐na yersels fause tae the truth. This wisdom is no the wisdom comin doon frae Aboon; but is yirthly, nateral, and deevilish. For whaur‐eʼer selliness and rivalry are, thar are taiglements and aʼ vile deeds. But the wisdom that is frae Aboon is first to purify, than peaceable and cannie; easy to be entreatit, fuʼ oʼ mercy and gude frutes; wiʼ nae puʼin doon; and aefauld. But the seed oʼ richtousness is sawn in peace, by thae wha mak peace. Whar come the wars and fechtins amang ye? Eʼen hence, oot oʼ yere pleasurs, that  tak the field amang yere members! Ye desire, and hae‐na; ye kill, and are fain, and canna obteen: ye fecht and war: ye hae‐na, for that ye ask‐na: Ye ask, and ye get‐na: for that ye ask‐na weel; that ye micht ware it on yere pleasurs. Ye adulteresses! ken‐ye‐na that the freendship oʼ the warld is enmity wiʼ God? Wha, then, wad be a freend oʼ the warld is makin his sel a fae to God. Or reck ye that in vain the  Scriptur says, “The spirit that dwalls in us leads to envy.” But he gies the mair lovin‐favor. Sae it is said, “God is again the prood anes; but to the humble anes he gies favor.” Pit yersels, than, aneath God; but staun up again Sautan, and he wull flee frae ye. Draw ye nar to God, and he wul draw nar to you. Mak clean yere hauns, sinners! and purify yere hearts, ye dooble anes! Be ye dool, and maen and greet! lat yere daffin be turned to lamentation, and joy to heaviness. Come doon laigh iʼ the sicht oʼ the Lord; and he wull lift ye up. Speak‐ye‐na again ane‐anither, brethren. He that speaks again his brither, or judges his brither, speaks again the law itsel, and judges the law: but gin ye pass judgment on the law, nae mair are ye a doer oʼ the law, but a judge! But thar is ae Lawgiver and Judge! he wha is strang to save and to destroy. But wha are ye that are judgin yere neebor? Awa noo! ye that say, “The day or the morn, we wull gang to this citie here; and bide a year thar; and troke, and win gear.” Wha, indeed, ken nocht oʼ the morn! for oʼ whatna sort is yere life? For as the scaum oʼ the sky ye are, whilk appears for a wee, and then dwines awa. Raither soud ye say, “Gin the Lord please, we sal baith leeve, and do this or yon.” But noo ye vaunt yersels in yere boastins. Aʼ sic boastin is ill. To ane, than, wha kens hoo to do a gude thing, and dis‐it‐na, it is a sin to him! Awa noo, ye rich! wail ye and cry, for the dool that is comin on ye! Yere gear has roustit; yere cleedin is moth‐eaten; Yere gowd and yere siller are roust‐eaten, and their roust sal witness again ye, and sal eat yere flesh as fire. Ye hae laid‐up treasur for the Last Day! Tak tent! the penny‐fee oʼ the workers, wha cuttit doon yere fields, and has by you been keepit back by dishonesty, is crying oot: and the cries oʼ thae that shure are enterʼt intil the hearin oʼ the Lord oʼ Hosts. Ye leeved wanton on the soil, and rioted; ye pamperʼt yere hearts, as for the  day oʼ slauchtir! Ye condemned, ye killed the Richtous Ane; and he resists‐ye‐na. Thole patiently, than, brethren! till the Lord be amang ye. Behauld, the tiller is waiting for the precious frutes oʼ the yirth, and is patient wiʼ it, till it gets the early and the hinmaist rain. Thole ye patiently, as weel! strenthen yere hearts; for the comin oʼ the Lord draws on! Yammer‐na, brethren, again ane anither, least ye be judged: See! the Judge stauns fornent the door. Tak ye, brethren, for yere likeness oʼ sufferan and patience, the Prophets that spak iʼ the name oʼ the Lord. Look! we caʼ thae happy wha tholed. Oʼ Jobʼs patience ye hae heard; and the end the Lord had in view ye saw: that the Lord is oʼ muckle tender‐love, and fuʼ oʼ compassion. But aboon aʼ things, my brethren, sweer‐na; aither by the heeven or the yirth, or by ony ither aith: but lat yere “aye” be “aye,” and yere “na” be “na”; least ye faʼ under judgment. Is ony afflictit amang ye? lat him be prayin! Is ony blythe? lat him sing wiʼ harp! Is ony ill amang ye? lat him caʼ till him the kirk elders; and lat them pray ower him, anointin him wiʼ oyle iʼ the name oʼ the Lord. And the faithfuʼ prayer sal save the dwinin ane, and the Lord wull raise him up: and gin aiblins he has sinned, it sal be forgien him. Sae confess ye ane to anither yere sins; and pray ye ilk for ither, to the end that ye may be healed. Muckle avails the prayers oʼ a richtous man in its ootcome. Elijah was a man, oʼ like natur wiʼ us; and wiʼ mickle prayer prayed he that thar soud be nae doonfaʼ; and thar was nae weet on the grunʼ for thrie year and a hauf; And again prayed he, and the lift gaʼe rain, and the yirth brocht forth her frute. My brethren, gin aiblins ony ane amang ye mis‐airts his way frae the truth, and anither convert him, Lat him ken, that he that turns a sinner frae the error oʼ his ways, sal save a saul frae death, and gets  coverʼt ower an unco wheen sins. Peter, an Apostle oʼ Jesus Christ, to the chosen anes wha bide in Pontus, Galacia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, Conform to the foreknowledge oʼ God the Faither, in sanctification oʼ the Spirit, to obedience and strinklin oʼ the blude oʼ Jesus Christ; lovin‐favor and peace till ye be increasʼd! Blessʼt be the God and Faither oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ, wha, conform to his great mercy, has regeneratit us intil a leevin hope, throwe Jesus Christʼs Risin‐again, frae ʼmang the deid, To a heritage uncorrupt, and pure, and unfadin, keepit iʼ the heevens for you, Wha are preserved by Godʼs pooer, by faith, to a salvation staunin ready for a revealin iʼ the last time. In whilk ye rejoice; thoʼ for a wee, e‐noo, gin need be, ye are made wae wiʼ a hantle oʼ trials, In order that the testin oʼ yere faith (muckle mair precious than oʼ gowd that perishes!), eʼen thoʼ throwe fire it is testit, soud be to praise, and glorie, and honor, whan revealʼt by Jesus Christ. Wham, no haein seen, ye loʼe; in wham, thoʼ no seein e‐noo, yet wiʼ faith ye are rejoicin wiʼ unspeakable joy, filled wiʼ glorie: Obteenin the end oʼ yere faith, the salvation oʼ yere sauls. Anent whilk salvation, the prophets socht oot and searchʼt oot, wha prophesyʼt oʼ the lovin‐favor that soud come to you. Seekin to ken as to what, or whatna mainner oʼ time, the Spirit oʼ Christ was giean them kennin oʼ, whan bearin witness aforehaun oʼ the sufferans oʼ Christ, and the glories eftir. Till wham it was made kent, that no to theirsels, but to you they war bringin them; whilk things e‐noo are reportit to ye throwe thae wha deliverʼt the Blythe‐Message to ye, iʼ the Holie Spirit sent doon frae heeven; intil whilk things the  Angels wad fain obteen a narer view. Sae, girdin up the loins oʼ yere endeavour, keepin douce, zealously airt ye yere hope to the lovin‐favor to be brocht to ye, at oor clear vision oʼ Jesus Christ. As bairns oʼ obedience, no conformin yersels to the auld desires iʼ yere ignorance; But eʼen as he wha bade ye is holie, do ye yersels be holie in aʼ mainner oʼ leevin; Inasmuckle as it is putten‐doon, “Holie sal ye be, for I am holie!” And gin ye caʼ on him, wha wiʼ nae respecʼ oʼ faces, judges conform to aneʼs ain wark, wiʼ aʼ reverence for the time oʼ yere bidin here, leeve ye. Kennin weel that it wasna wiʼ perishin things like siller and gowd, ye war ransomed oot oʼ yere vain life, frae yere forebears handit doon, But wiʼ maist precious blude (as oʼ a lamb wantin blemish or spot), oʼ Ane Anointit; Kent aforehaun; indeed, afore the foundin oʼ the warld, but made plain iʼ the last day for yere sakes, Wha throwe him are leal toward God, wha raisʼt him up frae ʼmang the deid, and gied him glorie, sae that yere faith and hope are turned towards God. Haein made yere sauls clean, iʼ the obeyin oʼ the truth oot oʼ the heart wiʼ leal and britherly love, loʼe ye ane‐anither fondly. Haein been born again, no oʼ corruptible seed, but incorruptible, throwe the leevin and abidin love oʼ God. Forasmuckle as “aʼ flesh is gerss, and aʼ its glorie as the blume oʼ gerss: the gerss birsles‐up, and the flourishin oʼt faʼs awa: “But the sayin oʼ the Lord bides for aye!” And this is the message that by the Glad‐tidins is deliverʼt tʼye. Sae, pittin by aʼ malice, and aʼ twafauldness, and aʼ pretence, and aʼ miscaʼin, As bairns new‐born, be ye fain to crave the aefauld milk oʼ reason, that sae ye may grow intil salvation; Gif sae ye hae tastit for yersels that the Lord is fuʼ oʼ mercie. To wham comin — a leevin stane, by men cuisten aside, but waled‐oot by God, and hauden in honor — Ye yersels, as leevin stanes, are biggit intil a spiritual hoose, to be holie priests, to offer up spiritual sacrifeeces, weel‐pleasin tae God, throwe Jesus Christ. For it is containʼd iʼ Scriptur, “See, I lay in Zion a heid corner‐stane, chosen, and hauden in honor, and wha lippens on him sal in naegate be putten to shame.” To you, than, is this honor; you wha lippen: but to sic as believe‐na — “The stane they that biggit wadna hae, the same was made a heid corner‐stane!” But, “a stumblin‐stane and a rock oʼ offence” to them that stoiter, bein disobedient to the word; until whilk they war appointit. But ye are “a waled‐oot race, priests oʼ royalty, a holie people”; a folk for his ain possession, that ye may tell oot the glories oʼ him wha bade ye oot oʼ darkness to come into his wunnerfuʼ licht. Wha at ae time war “nae‐nation,” but are noo a “Godʼs nation”; wha hadna been haein mercy, but hae obteened mercy e‐noo. Beloved, I entreat ye, as lodgers and pilgrims, keep ye frae carnal desires, sic as tak‐the‐field again the saul: Conductin yersels wiʼ honor amang the Gentiles; sae that whan they speak again ye as ill‐doers, they may, seein yere gude warks, glorify God in the  day oʼ his comin amang them. Obey‐ye aʼ human ordinances, for the Lordʼs sake; gin it be to a Sovereign, as ower aʼ, Or to Governors, as by him set, for punishin ill‐doers, but for praise oʼ them that do weel. For sae is Godʼs wull, that wiʼ weel‐doin ye soud pit to silence the ignorance oʼ glaikit men: As free, and yet no haudin yere freedom for a cloak oʼ malice; but as servants oʼ God. To aʼ men gie honor; loʼe ye the britherhood; revere ye God; honor ye the Sovereign! Servants, gie‐in to yere maisters, wiʼ aʼ respecʼ; and no alane to the gude and cannie, but to the thrawart as weel. For this is till his praise, gif, on accoont oʼ conscience afore God, ane drees dool; sufferin wrangously. For whatna credit win ye, gin ye be cloured for yere ill‐deeds, that ye soud thole it? But, doin weel, and dreein ill, this is praise‐wordie wiʼ God. For to siclike war ye caʼd: for Christ sufferʼt in yere behauf, leaʼin ahint a paittern, that ye micht follow his fitstaps: “Wha did nae sin; nor was deceit fund in his mooth”; Wha, whan miscaʼd, miscaʼd‐na again; sufferin, he banned‐na: but gied himsel ower to him wha judges justly. Wha his ain sel bure oor sins in his ain body tae the tree; sae that we, haein deeʼt to sin, micht leeve to holiness: “by whase clours ye war healed.” For ye war like sheep, forwanderin; but are noo came hame to the Shepherd and Guide oʼ yere sauls. In siclike mainner, ye wives, be biddable wiʼ yere ain husbands; sae that gin ony yield‐na tae the word, they may, eʼen wantin the word, be won by the gude‐leevin oʼ their wives; As they behauld yere pure mainner oʼ life, fuʼ oʼ reverence. Whase buskin let it no be aʼ ootward — the braidin oʼ hair, and wearin oʼ gowd, and dinkin‐oot in braws: But, the inner man oʼ the heart, iʼ the fadeless pitten‐on oʼ a meek and lown spirit, whilk is afore Godʼs face oʼ unco price. For sae, langsyne, the holie weemen, wha had their hopes on God, buskit theirsels; obeyin their ain husbands; Eʼen as Sarah obeyʼt Abraʼm, caʼin him “Lord”; whase bairns ye are, as lang as ye do weel,  fearin wiʼ nae fear. And ye husbands, in siclike mainner, dwall wiʼ them conform to knowledge, as wiʼ the weaker veschel, as being joint‐heirs oʼ leevin grace; that yere prayers be‐na interferʼd wiʼ. To sum up: be ye oʼ ae mind, sympathizin thegether, lovin the brethren, tender‐heartit, lowly‐mindit; No giean ill for ill, nor returnin miscaʼn for miscaʼin; but on the contrar giean blessin; for to this ye war bidden, that ye soud inherit a blessin. “For ye that wad loʼe life, and see gude days, let him gar his tongue cease frae ill, and his lips that they speak‐na guile. “But lat him turn awa frae the ill, and do the gude; let him seek peace and follow it. “For the Lordʼs eʼen are on the richtous anes, and his hearin to their petition; but the Lordʼs face is again them that do ill!” And wha is he that can bring ye skaith, gin ye be fuʼ oʼ zeal for what is gude? But gin eʼen ye soud dree ill for that whilk is gude, happy are ye! “But their dreid, dreid ye‐na! nor be ye put‐tillʼt; “But the Anointit, as Lord, sanctify ye iʼ yere hearts”; aye ready as a defence, wiʼ ilk ane speirin at ye a reason for the hope ye hae in ye: but aye wiʼ meekness, and reverence. Haein a gude conscience; sae that whaur‐in they speak again ye as ill‐doers, they may be putten to shame, wha miscaʼ yere gude mainner oʼ life in Christ. For nobler is it (gin it please the wull oʼ God sae) as weel‐doers to be sufferin, than as ill‐doers. For that Christ also, ance for aʼ, sufferʼt for sins; a Richtous Ane for unrichtous anes; that he soud bring us nar to God; haein been putten to deid in flesh, but made alive in spirit; In whilk, gaun eʼen to the  spirits in thrall, he preached; Wha war dour at ae time, whan Godʼs lang‐tholin was entreatin them iʼ the days oʼ Noah, the ark bein preparin; gaun intil whilk a wee wheen, that is aucht sauls, war brocht safe throwe by means oʼ watir: Whilk, as a true likeness, noo saves ye, eʼen baptism (no the syndin‐awa oʼ the filth oʼ the flesh, but the speirin oʼ a gude conscience toward God) throwe the Risin‐again oʼ Jesus Christ. Wha is at Godʼs richt haun, haein passed intil the heevens; Angels, and authorities, and pooers, bein made obedient to him. Forasmuckle than as Christ has sufferʼt iʼ the flesh, airm ye yersels wiʼ the same ettlin: for he that has tholed iʼ the flesh has  gotten rest frae sin! Sae that nae langʼer soud ye leeve iʼ the ill‐desires oʼ men the lave oʼ yere time iʼ the flesh. For the by‐past time is eneuch to hae wrocht‐oot the desires oʼ the Gentiles; gaun on in wantonness, ill‐desires, an owercome oʼ wine, riotins, feastins, and vile eidol‐worshippins; In whilk they ferlie unco that ye rin‐na wiʼ them to the same owerflowin oʼ riot, miscaʼin ye: Wha sal gie up an accoont to him wha is haudin himsel ready to judge leevin and deid. For to this end was the Blythe‐message gien to thae that are  deid; that they micht be judged, indeed, by manʼs judgment, in flesh; but micht leeve afore God in spirit. But the end oʼ aʼ comes on: be ye than oʼ sounʼ mind, and doucely pray ye. Aboon aʼ things, hae ye love ane for anither; for that “love haps ower a rowth oʼ sins.” Schawin hospitality ane to anither, wiʼ nae sweirness. Ilk ane, eʼen as he has had gien to him a free gift, sharin it wiʼ ithers, as leal stewards oʼ Godʼs mony‐fauld favors:— Gif ony ane speaks, as Godʼs oracles speakin; gif ony ane serʼs, as oot oʼ strenth gien by God; that, in aʼ things, God may be made glorious, throwe Jesus Christ, to wham is the glorie and the pooer, for evir and aye. Amen. Beloved, be ye na taen by surprise anent the lowin fire amang ye, whilk is comin on ye for to try ye, as gin some ferlie happenʼt to ye; But in sae far as ye marrow wiʼ Christ in his sufferans, rejoice ye; that, at the unfauldin oʼ his glorie, ye may rejoice wiʼ muckle joy. Gin ye be miscaʼd for Christʼs name, happy are ye! for the Spirit oʼ glorie, eʼen the Spirit oʼ God, brings ye rest! But lat nane oʼ ye dree as a blude‐shedder, or a thief, or an ill‐doer, or a meddler in ither folkʼs maitters: But, gin it be as “a Christian,” lat him feel nae shame; but lat him gie God praise for this name. For it is time for judgment to begin at the hoosehauld oʼ God; but gif it first begin wiʼ us, what sal be the end oʼ thae that gie‐na‐in to the Gude‐tidins oʼ God? And, gin the richtous ane jimply be saved, whaur sal the ungodly and the sinner schaw theirsels? And sae, lat they wha dree, conform to Godʼs wull, commit their sauls, in aʼ weel‐doin, till a true and faithfuʼ Creator! The elders that are amang ye I entreat, wha am, wiʼ you, an elder, and a witness oʼ the sufferans oʼ Christ; and ane to partak oʼ the glorie to be made kent; Herd the wee flock oʼ God amang ye! takin the chairge oʼt, no oʼ constraint, but oʼ gude‐wull, conform to God; nor yet for base gains, but oʼ ready mind. Nor yet as lordin it ower the allotted chairge, but makin yersels as paitterns to the wee flock. And whan the Heid‐Shepherd is made manifest, ye sal hae a croon that dwines‐na awa. In like mainner, ye younger anes, gie‐in to the aulder; and aʼ, ane to anither, pittin on humbleness oʼ mind; for “God arrays himsel again the haughty, but gies favor to the humble.” Lout yersels doon than, under the michty haun oʼ God, that he may raise ye up in due time. Castin aʼ yere carkin cares on him, for that he is carin for ye. Be douce; be alert; for Sautan yere fae, as a rampin lion, is gaun aboot, seekin wham to devoor. Wham resist ye, siccar iʼ the faith! kennin that like sufferins are brocht to pass wiʼ yere brethren that are iʼ the warld. But the God oʼ aʼ gude‐favor, wha caʼd ye to his evir‐bidin glorie, in Christ Jesus, whan ye hae tholed a wee, himsel will mak ye perfete, mak siccar, mak strang! To him be the glorie for evir and aye. Amen! By Silvanus, the leal brither as I tak him, wrate I in brief words, coonsellin and testifyin that this is Godʼs vera favor: staun ye inʼt! She in Babylon, chosen wiʼ yersels, and Mark my son, salute ye. Salute ye ilk ither wiʼ a kiss oʼ love. Peace to ye aʼ wha are in Christ. Simon Peter, a servitor and Apostle oʼ Jesus Christ, to thae wha obteened the same faith wiʼ us, throwe the richtousness oʼ oor God and oor Saviour Jesus Christ. Lovin‐favor to ye, and peace, be made great, iʼ the fuʼ knowledge oʼ God, and Jesus oor Lord; As aʼ things for life and godliness his godly pooer has gien to us, throwe the fuʼ knowledge oʼ him wha has caʼd us to glorie and weel‐doin. Whaur‐by he has gien to us unco promises — and precious — that throwe sic ye soud be brocht to hae fellowship wiʼ the Divine natur, and flee the warldʼs corruption in ill‐desires. Aye, and for this vera thing, bringin forrit aʼ diligence, add to yere faith courage, and to yere courage knowledge, And to knowledge the airtin oʼ yersel, and to the airtin oʼ yersel endurance, and to endurance holiness, And to holiness britherly‐kindness, and to yere britherly‐kindness love. Thir things belangin tʼye, and aboundin, they sal make ye to be naither idle nor unfrutefuʼ iʼ the fuʼ knowledge oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ. For he wha is wantin iʼ thir things is  blearʼt seein‐na far‐awa, haein forgotten the purifyin oʼ his auld sins. Whaur‐for the raither, brethren, gie gude tent to mak siccar yere callin and walin‐oot; for doin thir things ye sal in naegate at ony time stoiter. For sae sal unco richly be supplyʼt tʼye a graun enterin‐in to the evir‐bidin kingdom oʼ oor Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And sae Iʼse be aye ready to pit ye in mind oʼ thae things; thoʼ ye ken them, and hae been made siccar iʼ the truth present wiʼ ye. Nane‐the‐less, I tak it to be richt, as lang as I am iʼ this sheelin, to steer ye up, by remindin ye; Kennin that sune comes the pittin‐aff oʼ my sheelin, conform to what the Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. Yet I will gie gude tent, on ilka occasion, that ye may hae means, eftir my depairtin, to keep in mind aʼ thae things. For it wasna as followin eftir pawkilie‐wrocht‐oot tales, that we made kent to ye the pooer and  presence oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ; but as ee‐witnesses oʼ his gloriousness. For whan he was gien frae God the Faither honor and glorie, and a voice cam to him frae that glorious splendor, “This is my Son, the Beloved Ane, in wham I delicht!” Eʼen this voice we heard, whan it cam frae heeven; we bein wiʼ him iʼ the holie mount. And we hae the word oʼ prophecie, made maist siccar, to whilk ye do weel gin ye tak gude tent, as to a licht glintin in a mirk place, to what time the dawin come, and the mornin‐starn rise iʼ yere hearts. Kennin this first, that nae prophecie oʼ Scriptur is oʼ allenar and private  meaninʼ. For nevir cam ony prophecie by the wull oʼ man; but as by Holie Spirit movʼd, sae speak holie men oʼ God. But thar war fause‐prophets amang the folk; as eʼen amang you wull thar be fause‐teachers: sic as wull hidlins bring in diabolical sects eʼen denying the Lord wha bocht them; bringin doon on theirsels sudden destruction. And mony wull follow oot their wanton ways; throwe wham the way oʼ truth wull be miscaʼd; And in their menseless greed, wiʼ twafauld words, wull they mak trokin‐ware oʼ ye: whase condemnation oʼ auld days isna gane‐by, and their destruction sleeps‐na. For gin God didna spare Angels whan they sinned — castin them to hell — and deliverin them ower to dungeons oʼ gloom, keepit for judgment; And spared‐na the auld warld, letting lowse a flood on the ungodlie anes, but preserved Noah, a preacher oʼ richtousness, as the  auchth person: And bringin the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah till assis, whammlʼt them ower in condemnation; settin them forth as a lesson to sic as soud eftir be ungodly. And richtous Lot, sair vexʼt wiʼ the wanton lives oʼ the wicked, he deliverʼt; For wiʼ seein and hearin, that richtous ane dwallin among them was distressin his richtous saul wiʼ their lawless deeds. The Lord kens hoo to deliver sic as are godlie oot frae trials; and to keep tae the day oʼ Judgment to to be dealt wiʼ, sic as are ungodlie; Mair in particular, thae gaun awa eftir the flesh, iʼ the ill‐desires oʼ uncleanness; despisin rule; darin; pamperers oʼ theirsels; authorities they fear‐na to miscaʼ; Whaur‐as Angels, heigher in pooer and micht, fesh‐na a railin accusation again  them afore the Lord. But thir, as beass wantin reason, made to be taʼen and destroyed, miscaʼ things they kenna oʼ, iʼ their snarin sal theirsels be snared! Dreein wrang as the ootcome oʼ wrang‐doing; they that coont it a pleasur to riot iʼ the day‐time: blotches and blains; riotin in self?-?deceit as they feast wiʼ you. Eʼen takin‐up wi an adulteress, and that winna cease frae sin; wheedlin sauls that are waff; wiʼ a heart schuled by greed; bairns that are accurst; Gaun a‐gley frae the straught way, and are forewanderʼt; traikin eftir the gate oʼ Balaam son oʼ Bosor, wha socht the fees oʼ unrichtousness. But was repruvʼt for his ain wickedness; a dumb beasʼ wiʼ manʼs voice speakin, forbad the rage oʼ the prophet. Thir are waal‐ees wantin the watir; mists carryʼt wiʼ the wund; for wham the gloom oʼ mirkness is keepit for aye. For, speakin unco swalled‐up words oʼ vanity, they wheedle wiʼ fleshly desires, wiʼ wanton ways, thae that war escapin frae them that leeve in error; They promisin freedom to them, they theirsels bein aʼ the time slaves oʼ corruption. (For, by whateʼer ane has been owercome, he has become a slave tillʼt.) For gin aiblins eftir they had escapit the pollutions oʼ the warld, throwe a knowledge oʼ the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again taiglʼt thar‐in — their last state is waur nor the first! Unco better for them no to hae kent the way oʼ richtousness ava, than, haein come to ken it, to turn awa frae the holie commaun gien to them! It has come aboot wiʼ them conform to the true sayin, “The dog turnin again to his ain spuein;” and, “A sow weshed, to wallowin iʼ the muck.” This, a second letter, beloved, I am writin to ye; in whilk letters I steer up yere aefauld minds by way oʼ remindin, That ye soud mind the words the holie prophets spak afore, and the commauns oʼ the Lord and Saviour throwe yere Apostles. Kennin this first, that thar wull come scoffers iʼ the last day, scoffin; gaun on conform to their ain ill‐desires, And speirin, “Whaur is the promise oʼ his comin? for, frae whatna day the faithers drappit asleep, aʼ things gang even‐on frae the first oʼ the creation.” For this they oʼ their ain wull forget, that the heevens war frae oʼ auld, and the yirth oot oʼ the watir and throwe the watir swappit thegither, by Godʼs word; By whilk the warld than‐bein, whammlʼt‐ower in watir, perishʼt. While the heevens and the yirth that are noo, keepit by his word, hae been stored up for fire, for a day oʼ judgment and ruin oʼ ungodlie men. But tak gude tent oʼ this ae thing, beloved, that “Ae day is wiʼ the Lord as a thoosand year;” and a thoosand year as ae day. The Lord isna sweir anent his promise, as some men speak oʼ sweirness; but is lang‐tholin wiʼ you, no bein willin that ony soud be destroyʼt, but that aʼ soud airt their ways to repentance. But the day oʼ the Lord wull come as comes a thief; in whilk the heevens wiʼ an unco noise sal flee awa, and the elements sal be meltit wiʼ ragin heat, and the yirth and the warks oʼt sal be brunt. Seein than, that aʼ thir things are to be dissolvʼt, whatna persons soud ye aʼ the time be, in holie habits oʼ leevin, and warks oʼ godliness, Lookin forrit and bringin narer the comin oʼ Godʼs day, throwe whilk, the heevens bein a‐lowe, wull be dissolvʼt; and elements, wiʼ awesome heat, are to be meltit? But we look for new heevens and new yirth, conform to his promise, whaur holiness bides. Sae, beloved, lookin forrit for sic things, gie aʼ tent (wantin blotch or blain), to be fund oʼ him in peace: And reckon ye oor Lordʼs lang‐tholin to be salvation; eʼen as oor weel‐loʼed brither Paul, conform to the wisdom gien to him, wrate tʼye: As too, in aʼ letters, speakin in them oʼ thir things; in whilk letters are a wheen things hard to be comprehendit, whilk they that are ignorant and unsiccar  wrangly turn, as they dae the lave oʼ Scriptur, to their ain ruin. Ye than, weel‐lovʼd anes, kennin aforehaun, tak gude tent, least bein led a‐gley wiʼ the waʼ‐gaun oʼ the wicked, ye soud faʼ oot frae yere ain siccarness. But grow ye in lovin‐favor and knowledge oʼ oor Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be the glorie, baith e‐noo and for evir and aye. Amen! That whilk was frae the first oʼ aʼ, that whilk we hae heard, that whilk we hae seen wiʼ oor een, that whilk we for oorsels hae gazed upon, and oor hauns war laid on, oʼ the Word oʼ Life, — And the Life was made kent to us, and we hae seen, and gie witness, and report to you the evir‐durin Life, whilk was wiʼ the Faither, and was made kent to us. That whilk we hae oorsels seen and heard, we report to you, that ye too as weel may hae marrowin wiʼ us; and oor marrowin is wiʼ the Faither, and wiʼ his Son Jesus Christ. And we write thir things, that oor joy may be filled fuʼ. And this is what we hae heard oʼ him, and gie to you, that God is licht, and mirkness isna in him: nane ava! Gin aiblins we soud say, “We hae marrowin wiʼ him,” and are gaun on iʼ the mirk, we are leears, and divna the truth. But gin aiblins we are gaun on iʼ the licht, as he is in the licht, we marrow ane wiʼ anither, and the blude oʼ Jesus his Son maks us clean frae aʼ sin. Gin aiblins we soud say, “Sin hae we nane,” we deceive oorsels, and the truth bides‐na in us. Gin aiblins we confess oor sins, leal  and gude is he to forgie oor sins, and mak us pure frae ilk unrichtous deed. Gin aiblins we soud say, “We hae‐na sinned,” we are makin him fause, and his word isna in us. My dear bairns, thir things I write tʼye, that ye soudna sin; and gin aiblins ony ane sins, we hae an Advocat wiʼ the Faither, Jesus Christ the Gude! And he is the coverin‐ower oʼ oor sins; and no for oors allenar, but eʼen for thae oʼ the hail warld. And in siclike we ken that we hae come to ken him, gin we keep his commauns. He that says, “I hae gotten to ken him,” and keeps‐na his commauns, is a leear; and the truth isna in sic a ane. But whasaeʼer may be keepin his word, in sic a ane, truly, is the love oʼ God made perfete. And thus ken we that we are in him. He that says “he bides in him,” soud, eʼen as he walkit, sae walk his sel. Beloved, I write nae new commaun to ye, but an auld commaun, whilk ye had frae the first. The auld commaun is the word that ye heard. Again, a new commaun write I tʼye, and whilk is true in him and in you: “That the mirk is gane by, and the true licht noo shines oot!” He that says “He is iʼ the licht,” and hates his brither, is in the mirk eʼen till noo. He that loʼes his brither bides iʼ the licht; and thar is nae cause for stoiterin in him. Whaur‐as he wha hates his brither is iʼ the mirk, and gangs iʼ the mirk, and kens‐na whaur he is airtin, for that the mirkness has blindit his een. I write to you, dear bairns, for yere sins hae been forgien ye, for the sake oʼ his name. I write to you, faithers, for that ye hae come to ken him that was frae the first. I write to you, lads, for that ye hae owercome the ill‐ane. I wrate to you, dear bairns, for that ye hae come to ken the Faither. I wrate to you, faithers, for that ye hae come to ken him that was frae the first. I wrate to you, lads, for that ye are sterk, and the word oʼ God bides in ye, and ye hae owercome the ill‐ane. Love‐ye‐na the world, nor yet the things iʼ the world; gin ony ane is lovinʼ the warld, the love oʼ the Faither isna in him. For aʼ that is iʼ the warld, the desires oʼ the flesh and the craikin oʼ the een, and the pride oʼ folkʼs lives, isna oʼ the Faither, but is oʼ the warld. And the warld wears awa, and the desires oʼ the same; but wha dis the wull oʼ God bides for aye. Bairns, it is the last ʼoor; and, eʼen as ye heard tell that antichrist is comin, eʼen noo antichrists are mony; and sae we come to ken it is the last ʼoor. Frae ʼmang us they gaed oot, but they warna ane wiʼ us; for gin they had been ane wiʼ us, they wad hae bidden wiʼ us; but it was that they soud be kent, hoo they warna oʼ us. And ye hae an anointin frae the Holie Ane, and  ken aʼ things. I didna write ʼtʼye as jalousin ye kent‐na the truth, but for that ye kent it, and for that nae lee is oʼ the truth. Wha is a leear, gin it be‐na he that denies that Jesus is the Anointit? This is the antichrist, he wha denies the Faither and the Son. Ilka ane wha denies the Son hasna the Faither: he that owns the Son has the Faither as weel. As for yersels, lat that bide wʼye that ye heard frae the first: for gin ye abide in what ye heard at the first, ye sal abide in the Son, and abide in the Faither. And this is the promise he promised to us, eʼen the life that is forevir and aye. Thir things I wrate to ye, anent thae that beguile ye. As for you, the anointin ye had frae him bides within ye, and ye dinna need ony ane soud gie ye lear; but as his anointin schaws ye oʼ aʼ things, and is true and nae lee, eʼen conform tae the lear oʼt, bide ye in him! And noo, dear bairns, bide ye in him; sae that gin aiblins he soud be made seen, we may hae freedom oʼ speech, and no be putten to shame at his comin. Gin aiblins ye ken that he is richtous, ken ye as weel that ilka ane that is doin richtousness is born oʼ him. Look, whatna love the Faither has bestown on us, that we soud be caʼd “Godʼs Bairns”; and we are! And that the warld kens‐us‐na; for it kent‐him‐na! Beloved, noo are we bairns oʼ God; and it hasna yet been seen what we sal be. But we ken that gin he sal be seen, we sal be like him; for we sal see him; conform to what he is. And ilka ane haein this hope in him, maks his sel pure, eʼen as Christ is pure. Ilk ane that dis sin brecks ower the law; for sin is a breckin ower the law, And ye are aware that he was made kent, that he micht tak awa oor sins; and in him sin isna! Nae ane bidin in him sins; nae ane sinnin has seen him nor comprehendit him. Dear bairns! lat nae ane beguile ye! He that dis richtousness he is richtous, eʼen as Christ is richtous. He that dis sin is oʼ Sautan; for Sautan sins frae the first. And for this end was the Son oʼ God made kent, that he micht whammle ower the warks oʼ Sautan. Nae ane begotten oʼ God gangs on in sin; for his seed in him abides; and he canna gang on in sin, for he is begotten oʼ God. In siclike is made kent the bairns oʼ God, and the bairns oʼ Sautan. Nae ane that disna do richtousness is oʼ God, naither he that loeʼs‐na his brither. For this is the message ye heard frae the first: that we soud loʼe ane anither: No like Cain, wha was oʼ the Ill‐ane, and slew his brither. And for why did he slay him? For that his warks war ill, and his britherʼs richtous. Brethren, ferlie‐na gin the warld hate ye. We oorsels ken we hae stappit ower frae death intil life, for that we loʼe the brethren. He that loeʼs‐na bides still in death. Ilka ane that hates his brither is a  blude‐shedder; and we ken that nae blude‐shedder has evir‐durin life bidin in him. Hereby hae we come to ken love, in that Christ on our behauf laid doon his life; and we soud, in behauf oʼ the brethren to pawn oor lives. But whasae has this warldʼs gear, and sees his brither in need, and steeks oot his tender affections awa frae him, hoo dwalls Godʼs ain love in him? Dear bairns! lat us no loʼe alane in words; nor wiʼ the tongue, but in warks and in truth! And in this sal we come to ken that we oorsels are oʼ the truth, and sal mak blythe oor hearts afore him. Whan oor hearts wyte us, God is aboon oor hearts, and kens aʼ things. Beloved, gin aiblins oor heart wytes‐us‐na, we hae freedom oʼ speech toward God; And whatna things we may be seekin, we are obteenin frae him; for his commauns we are keepin, and the things pleasin in his sicht we are doin. And this is his commaun, that we soud hae faith iʼ the name oʼ his Son Jesus Christ, and be loeʼin ane anither; conform to the commaun he gied us. And he that keeps his commauns, in Christ abides, and he in him! And thus we ken that he abides in us, throwe the Spirit he has gien us. Weel‐loeʼd anes! lippen‐ye‐na aʼ spirits, but try the spirits, gin they be oʼ God! for mony fause‐prophets are gane oot intil the warld. Hereby ken ye the spirit oʼ God: ilka spirit that owns Jesus Christ, as haein come iʼ the flesh, is oʼ God; And ilka spirit that owns‐na Jesus, is noʼ oʼ God. And this is the spirit oʼ antichrist that ye heard oʼ as comin; and eʼen noo is it iʼ the warld. Ye are oʼ God, dear bairns, and hae owercome them; for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the warld. Thir are oʼ the warld; and sae they speak oʼ the warld, and the warld hearkens to them. We are oʼ God! He that kens God, hearkens to us; and he that isna oʼ God hearkens‐na till us: and sae we ken the spirit oʼ truth and the spirit oʼ error. Beloved, lat us loʼe ane anither; for love is oʼ God; and ilk ane that loʼes is begotten oʼ God, and kens God. He that loʼes‐na, neʼer kent God: for God is love. And sae was made to be seen the love oʼ God in us, that God sent oot his only‐begotten Son into the warld, that we micht leeve throwe him. In this is love — no that we loʼed God, but that he loʼed us, and sent oot his Son, a coverin‐ower for oor sins. Beloved! gin God sae loʼed us, we too soud loʼe ane anither, Nae ane has at any time seen God; gin we be loʼein ane anither God bides in us, and his love has been made perfete in us. And thus we ken that we bide in him, and he bides in us, on account oʼ his Spirit he has gien us. And we hae  seen him, and gie witness that the father has sent oot the Son, as the Saviour oʼ the warld. Whasae may own that Jesus is the Son oʼ God, God bides in him, and he abides in God. And we hae come to ken and to believe the love that God has to us. God is love; and he wha bides in love, bides in God, and God bides in him. Herein is love perfetit in us, that we may hae freedom oʼ speech iʼ the day oʼ judgment, in that, eʼen as he is, sae are we iʼ this warld. Fear bides‐na in love; nay, perfete love casts oot fear; for fear has misery, and wha fears isna made perfete in love. We loʼe, for that he first loʼed us. Gin aiblins any ane soud say, “I loʼe God!” and is hatin his brither, he is a leear; for he that loʼes‐na his brither wham he has seen, hoo can he be loʼein God wham he hasna seen? And this commaun hae we frae him, that he wha loʼes God is to be loʼein his brither as weel. Whasae believes that Christ is the Anointit, is begotten oʼ God; and ilka ane that loʼes him that begat, loʼes him as weel that is begotten oʼ him. By this we ken that we loʼe Godʼs bairns, when we loʼe God, and are keepin his commauns: For this is the love oʼ God, that we soud keep his commauns; and his commauns are na burden. For aʼ that is born oʼ God owercomes the world; and this is the victory that overcam the warld, eʼen oor faith. And wha is he that owercomes the warld, but he that believes Jesus is Godʼs Son? This is he wha came baith by watir and blude, Jesus Christ; no in watir alane; but by the watir and by the blude. And it is the Spirit that is bearin witness, for the Spirit is truth. For thar are thrie that are giean witness, the Spirit, and the watir, and the blude; and the thrie are for the ae thing. Gin we accept the witness oʼ men, the witness oʼ God is mair; for this is the witness oʼ God, that he has witnessed anent his Son. He wha hauds to the Son oʼ God has the witness in himsel; he wha lippens‐na God, has made him oot fause; for he hasna pitten faith iʼ the witness God has witnessed enent his Son. And here is the witness: that God has giftit us wiʼ eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Wha has the Son has the life; and wha hasna the Son oʼ God hasna the life. Thir things I wrate to ye that ye micht ken  ye hae eternal life; to you wha are pittin faith iʼ the name oʼ the Son oʼ God. And this is the freedom oʼ speech that we hae toward him; that, gin onything we be askin, conform to his wull, he hearkens to us. And, gif we ken he hearkens to us, whatna thing we may be askin frae him, we ken that we hae the askins that we askit oʼ him. Gin aiblins ony ane soud see his brither sinnin a sin no to death, he sal ask, and he wull gie him life, for thae sinnin no to death. Thar is a sin to death: no anent that am I sayin that he soud mak request. Aʼ wickedness is sin, and thar is sin no to death. We ken that nae ane begotten oʼ God is sinnin; but anent him wha was begotten oʼ God — he keeps him, and yon Ill‐ane disna touch him. We ken that we are oʼ God, and the hail warld is in the airms oʼ the Ill‐ane. But we ken the Son oʼ God has come, and has gien us an inward sicht, that we may comprehend the True Ane; and we are in the True Ane; in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and, and life‐for‐aye. Dear bairns! gaird yersels frae eidols! The Elder to a  chosen leddy, and her bairns, wham I loʼe iʼ the truth; and no I allenar, but aʼ thae too that hae come to ken the truth; For the truth that is bidin in us, and sal be wiʼ us for aye. Lovin‐favor sal be wiʼ us, mercy and peace frae God the Faither, and frae Jesus Christ the Son oʼ the Faither, in truth and love. I was blythe that I faund amang yere bairns thae that war ganging iʼ the truth, eʼen as we hae had commaun oʼ the Faither. And noo I beg oʼ ye, leddy, no as giean a new commaun to ye, but eʼen what we had frae the first, that we soud loʼe ane anither. And this is love, that we gang conform to his commauns. This is his commaun, eʼen as ye heard frae the first, that we soud gang thar‐in. For mony fause‐anes hae gane oot intil the warld, they that own‐na that Jesus Christ is come iʼ the flesh. This is a fause‐ane and an antichrist. Tak ye gude tent to yersels, least ye tine what things ye did win; but that a fuʼ reward ye may duly hae. Whasaeʼer gangs ayont, and bides‐na iʼ the teachins oʼ Christ, hasna God. He that bides iʼ the teachins, eʼen he has baith the Faither and the Son. Gif ony ane comes tʼye, and brings‐na this teachin, tak‐him‐na to yere hoose, nor say to him, “Joy be wʼye!” For he that says to him, “Joy be wʼye!” marrows wiʼ his ill‐deeds. Haein mony things to write tʼye, I wadna wiʼ paper‐an‐ink; but I hope to come tʼye, and speak mouʼ to mouʼ, that yere joy may be fuʼ. The bairns oʼ yere chosen sister salute ye. The Elder tae Gaius the weel‐loʼed, wham I loʼe truly. Beloved, I pray that in aʼ things ye may be prosperin, and be in health; eʼen as ye are prosperin in yere saul. For I was blythe whan the brethren cam, and bure witness to yere aefauldness, eʼen as ye are walkin in aefauldness. Greater joy hae I nane than that I soud be hearin oʼ my bairns, ganging iʼ the truth. Beloved, a thing oʼ faith are ye doin, whatsae ye are doin for the brethren — and to them being fremd folk tʼye. Wha testifyʼt afore the Kirk to yere love; wham ye sal do weel to set forrit on their journey, in a way wordie oʼ God. For in behauf oʼ “The Name” they gaed forth, takin naething frae thae ootside. We, than, soud susteen sic as thir, that we may be fellow‐workers wiʼ the truth. I wrate somewhat to the Kirk, but he wha is fain to be heid amang them — Diotrephes — bids me nae welcome. Whaur‐for, gin aiblins I come, I wull hae in mind his warks that he dis, wiʼ ill‐words miscaʼin us; and, no content wiʼ thir things, he naither bids welcome the brethren, nor hauds frae castin oot oʼ the Kirk thae that are sae disposed. Beloved, pit‐ye‐na on that whilk is ill, but that whilk is gude. The weel‐doer is oʼ God; the ill‐doer hasna seen God. Aʼ hae borne witness to Demetrius; and the truth itsel. We too, gie witness, and ye ken oor witness is true. Mony things had I to write ye; but I am‐na ready wiʼ ink‐and‐pen to be writin tʼye; But I am hopin belyve to see ye, and we will speak mouʼ to mouʼ. Peace be tʼye. The freends salute ye. Salute ye the freends by name. Jude, a servitor oʼ Jesus Christ, brither oʼ James, to thae wha bein in God the Faither beloved anes, and keepit in Jesus Christ, are the chosen. Mercie to you, and peace and love, be made mair! While I was giean aʼ tent to be writin to ye oʼ oor common salvation, I fand it necessar to write to ye, exhortin ye to strive uncolie for the faith ance‐and‐for‐aʼ gien to the saunts. For thar slippit in a wheen men, oʼ wham it was putten‐doon lang syne, that this soud be their condemnation, ungodlie anes — oor Godʼs lovin‐favor turnin intil wantonness, and disownin oor only Lord Jesus Christ. I am thar‐for disposed to pit ye in mind, thoʼ ance‐and‐for‐aʼ ye ken aʼ things, that the Lord, haein saved a folk oot oʼ the land oʼ Egypt, did again destroy them wha believed‐na. Angels too, thae wha mainteenʼd‐na their ain station, but left their ain place, has he keepit for judgment oʼ a great day, in evir‐durin bonds, in mirkness. As Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities aboot them, for that in siclike they gaed oot to commit uncleanness, and gaun eftir strange flesh, are set forrit as a warnin, dreein the penalty of endless fire. And in siclike, eʼen thir dreamers defile the flesh, despise authoritie, and miscaʼ dignities; Whaur‐as Michael the Archangel, whan contendin wiʼ Sautan he debatit aboot Mosesʼ body, daurna miscaʼ him; but quoʼ he, “The Lord repruve ye!” But thir, as mony things as they ken‐na, they miscaʼ; while in as mony things as they ken by nature as the beass without reason, in thir they corrupt theirsels. Alack for them! for they gaed on iʼ the path oʼ Cain, and warslʼt forrit iʼ the sin oʼ Balaam, and perishʼt iʼ the mockery oʼ Korah. Thir are they that are like hidlin rocks at yere love‐feasts, whan they feast wʼye; shepherds  feedin theirsels withoot shame; cluds wantin moisture, by the winds driven on; trees oʼ the leaf‐faʼin, wantin frute, twice deid, rived up by the rutes; Wild waves oʼ the sea, foamin oot oʼ their ain shame; gangrel starns, for wham black mirkness has been keepit for aye. And to thir prophesyʼt Enoch, the seeventh frae Adam, and quoʼ he, “Behauld! the Lord cam, amang his holie myriads, “To gie judgment upon aʼ, and to sentence aʼ the ungodlie anent aʼ their warks oʼ wickedness they for ungodliness had done; and anent aʼ the hard things they spak again him; sinfuʼ, ungodlie men!” Thir are yammerers, compleenin anes, gaun on eftir their ain desires; and their mouʼ speak heigh swallin words, fleeching and flatterin folk for their ain ends. But ye beloved, mind ye the words afore spoken by the Apostles oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ; For they tellʼt ye that iʼ the last times thar soud be mockers, gaun on conform to their own ungodlie desires. Thir are they that mak separations; nateral men, no possessin the Spirit: But ye beloved, up‐biggin yersels iʼ yere maist holie faith, prayin iʼ the Holie Spirit, Keep yersels in Godʼs love, lookin for the mercie oʼ oor Lord Jesus Christ until life‐for‐aye. And on some hae unco compassion, while they argue wʼye; And ithers save wiʼ terrors, cleekin them oot oʼ the lowe; and on ithers hae mercie in fear, hatin eʼen the garment stained by the flesh. Noo to him wha is strang to gaird ye frae faʼin, and to set‐ye‐doon iʼ the presence oʼ his glorie faultless, wiʼ unco rejoicin, To this ae God oor Saviour, throwe Jesus Christ oor Lord, be glorie, heighness, dominion, and pooer, afore aʼ time past, and noo, and for aʼ time to come! Amen! A revealin oʼ Jesus Christ, that God gied to him, to mak kent to his servants the things that bude come to pass; and he sent and schawed by signs, throwe his Angels, to his servitor John: Wha bure witness anent the word oʼ God, and the testifyin oʼ Jesus Christ, and as mony things as he saw. Happy he wha reads, happy they wha listen to the words oʼ the Revealin, and keeps the things sae putten‐doon; for the time rows on! John to the Seeven Kirks that are in Asia: lovin‐favor to ye, and peace, frae Wha‐Is, and Wha‐Was, and Wha‐is‐to‐Be; and frae the  seeven Spirits that are afore his thron. And frae Jesus Christ, the leal witness, “the first‐born oʼ the deid, the heid oʼ the kingly anes oʼ the yirth.” To him wha loʼes us, and lowsed us oot oʼ oor sins wiʼ his blude, And made oʼ us a kingdom! priests to his God and Faither; to him be glorie and dominion for evir and aye. Amen! Tak tent! he comes in cluds, and every ee sal see him, and they that pierced him; and aʼ the tribes oʼ the yirth sal maen for him. “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says God, “Wha‐Is, and Wha‐Was, and Wha‐is‐to‐Be, the Almichty!” I John, yere brither, and yere marrow in dool, and the kingdom, and the tholin, in Jesus, was iʼ the Isle caʼd Patmos, for the sake oʼ the word oʼ God, and the witness oʼ Jesus. I cam to be iʼ the Spirit on the Lordʼs Day; and heard, ahint me, an awfuʼ voice as oʼ a bugle horn, Sayin, “What ye behauld write ye in a buik, and send to the Seeven Kirks; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.” And I turned me aboot to see the voice that spak to me, and haein turned, I saw seeven gowden lamp‐bearers; And in the mids oʼ the seeven gowden lamp‐bearers, Ane like as to the Son oʼ Man, cleedit wiʼ a mantle doon till his fit, and rowʼt aboot the breist wiʼ a gowden girdin‐graith. His heid and his locks white, as the white wooʼ, as the snaw; and his een like a lowing  fire. And his feet like tae brass made clear, as gin they war meltit in a furnace; and his voice as the sough oʼ mony watirs. And he had in his richt haun seeven starns, and oot oʼ his mouʼ gaed forth a keen twa‐moothed sword; and his countenance was like the sun shinin in his strength. And whan I saw him, I loutit doon at his feet as ane deid. And he laid his richt haun on me, and quoʼ he, “Be na fleyʼt! I am the first and the last; “And the Leevin‐Ane; and I was deid, and behauld! leevin am I for evir and aye, and I hae the keys oʼ death and the pit. “Set doon, than, the things ye saw, and the things that are, and the things that are sune to come eftir thir present things. “The secret oʼ the seeven starns that ye saw on my richt haun, and the seeven lamp‐bearers oʼ gowd: the seeven starns are the messengers oʼ the Seeven Kirks; and the seeven lamp‐bearers are the Seeven Kirks.” To the messenger oʼ the Kirk in Ephesus write: Thir things quoʼ he wha siccar hauds the seeven starns in his richt haun, he that gangs amid the seeven gowden lamp‐bearers: “I ken yere warks, and strivin, and yere patience; and that ye canna thole ill men; and did test them caʼin theirsels ‘Apostles,’ and are‐na, and faund them leears; “And has striven, and for my name did thole, and hasna gien ower. “Nane‐the‐less, I hae this again ye, that ye hae turned awa frae yere first love. “Bring ye to mind, than, frae whaur ye hae faun; and turn ye, and div ye yere first warks; or Iʼse come tʼye, and wull tak awa yere lamp‐bearer oot oʼ its place — gin ye turn‐na. “But this ye hae, that ye scunner at the warks oʼ the Nicolaitanes, eʼen whilk I scunner at. “Wha has hearin, lat him hear what the Spirit is sayin to the Kirks! To him wha prevails, I wull gie to him to eat oʼ the tree oʼ Life, whilk is in the Paradise oʼ God. “And to the messenger oʼ the Kirk in Smyrna write: Thir things says the First and the Last, wha was deid, and is leevin: “I ken yere warks, and dool, and poortith (but rich are ye!), and the miscaʼin oʼ thae that caʼ theirsels Jews, and are‐na, but are a kirk oʼ Sautan. “Be‐na‐fleyʼt as to whatna things ye are to dree. And look! the Enemy is aboot to cast some oʼ ye intil thrall, that ye may be testit; and yeʼse hae dool ten days. Be ye leal to death, and I wull gie ye the croon oʼ Life! “Wha has hearin, lat him hear what the Spirit says to the Kirks! He that prevails, sal in naegate be skaithed oʼ the second death. “And to the messenger oʼ the Kirk in Pergamum write: Thir things says he wha has the keen twa‐moothʼd sword, “I ken whaur ye dwall, eʼen whaur Sautan has his thron; and that ye haud siccar my name, and that ye didna disown my faith, eʼen iʼ the days oʼ Antipas, my leal ane, wha was slain amang ye, whaur Sautan bides. “But I hae again ye a wheen things: that ye hae thar sic as haud siccar the teachin oʼ Balaam, wha airtit Balak to set a snare afore the children oʼ Israʼl, to eat oʼ eidol‐sacrifeeces, and commit uncleanness. “Sae hae ye thae as haud siccar the teachins oʼ the Nicolaitanes, in siclike mainner. “Turn ye than; but if no, I am comin to ye wiʼ speed, and wull war again them wiʼ the sword oʼ my mooth. “Wha has hearin, lat him hear, what the Spirit is sayin to the Kirks! To him that prevails, wull I gie oʼ the secret man; and wull gie him a white stane, and on the stane a new name inscrivʼt, that nae ane kens savin he that gets it. “And to the messenger oʼ the Kirk in Thyatira write: Thir things says the Son oʼ God, he wha has his een like a lowin fire, and his feet like brass made clear: “I ken yere warks, and lealness, and love, and service, and yere patient tholin, and yere warks; and the end to be  mair nor the beginnin. Nane‐the‐less, I hae this again ye, that ye thole that wumman, Jezebel, wha caʼs hersel a prophetess; and she wheedles my servants to commit uncleanness, and to eat eidol sacrifeeces. “And I gied her time to turn frae her uncleanness, and she repentit‐na. “Behauld! I wull cast her intil a  bed, and thae that commit adultery wiʼ her sal sair pyne, gin they turn‐na frae her warks. “And Iʼse slay her bairns wiʼ death; and aʼ the Kirks sal come to ken that I am he that rypes the inwarts and the heart; and I wull return ye — ilk ane — conform to yere warks. “But to you I say, to the lave in Thyatira, as mony haud‐na this teachin, and ken‐na ‘the deep things oʼ Sautanʼ (as they say), I lay on ye nae ither burden. “But what ye hae, haud ye siccar, till sic time as I may come! “And he that prevails, and he that hauds on by my warks to the end, I wull gie him pooer ower the nations; “And he sal rule them wiʼ an airn sceptre, as pottersʼ veschels are dung in blads; as I too hae received frae my Faither. “And I wull gie him the starn oʼ the dawin. “He that has hearin lat him hearken what the Spirit is saying to the Kirks!” “And to the messenger oʼ the Kirk in Sardis write ye: Thir things says he wiʼ the seeven Spirits oʼ God, and the seeven starns: I ken what ye div, and that ye hae the name oʼ leevin whan ye are deid. “Tak ye gude tent, and mak siccar what remain, that are ready to dee; for I haena fund yere warks accomplishʼt iʼ the sicht oʼ my God. “Mind weel, than, hoo ye obteenʼd and heard; and haud siccar, and turn. Gin ye gaird‐na, I wull come as comes a thief, and in naegate sal ye ken whatna ʼoor Iʼse come on ye. “But ye hae a wee wheen names in Sardis, wha haena stained their robes, and they sal walk wiʼ me in white; for they are wordie. “Whasae prevails sal be buskit in white cleedin; and in naegate wull I delete his name oot oʼ the Buik oʼ Life: and I wull own his name afore my Faither, and afore his Angels. “He that has hearin, lat him hear what the Spirit is sayin to the Kirks! “And to the messengers oʼ the Kirk in Philadelphia write ye: Thir things says the Holie Ane, the True Ane, he that has the key oʼ Dauvid, he that opens and nane can steek, and steek and nane can open: “I ken yere warks (tak tent! I hae set afore ye a door unsteekit; as to whilk nane can shut it!) for ye hae a wee pooer, and did keep my word, and didna disown my name. “Look! I gie them oʼ Sautanʼs kirk, whilk sae they are Jews and are‐na, but lee; see, I wull gar them come and lout doon afore yere feet, and ken that I hae loʼed ye. “For that ye did keep the word oʼ my patience, I sal eʼen keep ye oot oʼ the ʼoor oʼ trial, whilk is coming on the hail warld, to test them dwallin on the yirth. “Wiʼ haste come I! haud fast what ye hae, sae as nae man taks yere croon! “He that prevails, I wull mak him a strang pillar iʼ the temple oʼ my God; and oot‐by sal he gang nae mair; and I wull set upon him the name oʼ my God, and the name oʼ the citie oʼ my God, New Jerusalem, she wha is to come doon oot oʼ heeven frae my God: and my new name. “He that has hearin lat him hear what the Spirit is sayin to the Kirks! “And to the messenger oʼ the Kirk oʼ Laodicea write ye: Thir things says the Amen, the Leal, and True Witness, the  First oʼ the Creation oʼ God: “I ken yere warks, that naither cauld nor het ye are; I wad that ye had been aither cauld or het! “And sae than, for that ye are simmer‐warm, and naither cauld nor yet het, I wull spue ye oot oʼ my mooth! “For ye are sayin: ‘Rich am I; and hae rowth oʼ plenishin, and want nocht!’ and divna ken that ye are the waesome ane, and miserable; and in need, and blinʼ, and nakit. “I coonsel ye to buy frae me gowd made clear wiʼ fire, that ye may be rich; and white cleedin that ye may be weel‐buskit; and that the shame oʼ yere nakitness appear‐na; and ee‐saʼ to anoint yere een that ye may see. “I, as mony as I weel‐loʼe, repruve and chasten; be zealous than, and turn ye! “Mark, I am staunin at the door, and chappin; gin ony ane hearken to my voice, and unsteek the door, I wull gang in to him, and sup wiʼ him, and he wiʼ me. “He that prevails, I wull gie to him to tak his seat wiʼ me iʼ my thron; as I eʼen prevailʼt, and took my seat wiʼ my Faither in his thron. “He that has hearin, lat him hear what the Spirit is sayin to the Kirks!” Eftir thir things I airtit my een, and lo! a door was unsteekit in heeven; and the first voice I heard, like a buglehorn, was speakin wiʼ me, sayin, “Come ye up here, and I wull set oot afore ye what things maun come to pass here‐eftir.” And belyve I was iʼ the Spirit; and lo! a Thron was set in heeven; and on the Thron Ane sittin; And he that was sittin was like to a jasper stane and a cornelian; and a rainbow was aboot the Thron, to look on like an emerant. And roond aboot the Thron, fowr‐and‐twenty throns; and on the throns fowr‐and twenty Elders sittin, cledit in robes oʼ white; and on their heads croons oʼ gowd. And oot oʼ the Thron gaed oot fire‐flauchts, and voices, and thunners, and thar war seeven fiery lamps alowe afore the Thron, whilk are the seeven Spirits oʼ God. And afore the Thron a glessy sea, like to crystal; and iʼ the mids oʼ the Thron, and roond about the Thron, fowr leevin‐anes, fuʼ oʼ een afore and ahint. And the first leevin‐ane was like a lion; and the second leevin‐ane like a cauf; and the third leevin‐ane had the face as oʼ a man; and the fowrth leevin‐ane was like to an eagle fleein. And the fowr leevin‐anes, ilk ane oʼ them, had sax wings, and war fuʼ oʼ een aroond and within; and rest‐they‐na, day nor nicht, sayin, “Holie, holie, holie! Lord God Almichty, wha Was, and wha Is, and whar Is‐to‐Come!” And whan the leevin‐anes gie glorie, and honor, and thanksgivin to him that sits on the Thron, to him wha leeves for evir and evir, The fowr‐and‐twenty Elders faʼ doon afore him wha sits on the Thron, and gie worship to him wha leeves for evir and evir, and cast doon their croons afore the Thron, sayin, “Wordie art thou, O Lord, eʼen oor God, to receive aʼ glorie, and honor, and pooer; for thou did mak aʼ things; and oʼ thy wull they war, and war creatit!” And I saw, on the richt haun oʼ him that sat on the Thron, a buik, written within and withoot, sealʼt up wiʼ seeven seals. And I saw a michty Angel, proclaimin wiʼ a soondin voice, “Wha is fit to open the Buik, and to lowse its seals?” And nae man was fit, in heeven, nor yet on the yirth, to open the buik, or eʼen to look upon it. And I grat sair, that nae man was fund fit to open the buik, or eʼen to look onʼt. And ane frae mang the Elders says tae me, “Greet‐na: see! the Lion oʼ the tribe oʼ Judah, the Rute oʼ Dauvid, has prevailʼt to open the buik, and the seeven seals oʼt.” And I saw, iʼ the mids oʼ the Thron, and oʼ the fowr leevin‐anes, and in mids oʼ the Elders, a Lamb staunin, as it had been slain, haein seeven horns and seeven een, whilk are the seeven Spirits oʼ God sent oot till aʼ the yirth. And he cam, and has taʼen the buik oot oʼ the richt haun oʼ him that sits on the Thron. And as soon as he raxʼt for the buik, the fowr leevin‐anes and the fowr‐and‐twenty Elders fell doon afore the Lamb, haein ilk a harp, and gowden flagons fuʼ oʼ insence, whilk are the prayers oʼ saunts; And they sing a  new sang, sayin, “Wordie art thou, to tak the buik and to lowse its seals; for thou was slain, and has brocht us to God by thy blude, oot oʼ ilka tribe, and tongue, and folk, and nation; “And did mak them a kingdom and priests to oor God; and they rule on the yirth!” And I saw, and I heard as a voice oʼ mony Angels, roond aboot the Thron, and oʼ the leevin‐anes, and oʼ the Elders; and their number was myriads of myriads, and thoosands oʼ thoosands. Sayin wiʼ a soondin voice, “Wordie is the Lamb that was slain, to receive pooer, and riches, and wisdom, and micht, and honor, and glorie, and blessin!” And ilka creatit thing that is in Heeven, and on the yirth, and aneath the yirth, and on the sea, heard I sayin, “To him that sits on the Thron, and to the Lamb, be the blessin, and the honor, and the glorie and the pooer, for evir and aye!” And the fowr leevin‐anes war sayin “Amen!” And the Elders loutit doon and worshipped. And I saw whan the Lamb lowsed ane oʼ the seals, and I heard ane oʼ the leevin‐anes sayin in a voice oʼ thunner, “Come!” And I saw, and lo! a white horse, and he that was on it was haudin a bow; and a croon was gien to him; and he gaed oot conquerin and that he soud conquer. And whan he had lowsed the second seal, I heard the second leevin‐ane, sayin, “Come!” And forth gaed anither horse, reid; and to him that sat onʼt it was gien to tak peace frae the yirth, and that they soud shed ithersʼ blude; and thar was gien to him a great sword. And whan he had lowsed the third seal, I heard the third leevin‐ane sayin, “Come!” And I lookit, and lo! a black horse, and he that sat on it had a pair oʼ bauks in his haun. And I heard a voice iʼ the mids oʼ the fowr leevin‐anes, sayin, “Twa gowpens oʼ wheat for a hauf‐merk, and a forpet oʼ barley for a hauf‐merk; and the oyle and the wine ye are‐na to skaith!” And whan he lowsed the fowrth seal, I heard the fowrth leevin‐ane sayin, “Come!” And I lookit, and lo! a blae horse, and he that sat onʼt had his name “Death,” and the Sheuch followʼt wiʼ him. And he had pooer gien him ower a fowrth pairt oʼ the yirth to slay wiʼ the sword, and wiʼ hungʼer, and wiʼ the  death, and wiʼ the wild beass oʼ the yirth. And whan he lowsed the fifth seal, I saw, aneath the altar, the sauls oʼ sic as had been slain for the word oʼ God, and for the witness that they held. And they cryʼt oot wiʼ a lood voice, sayin, “To whatna time, O Lord, the Holie and the True, dost thou no judge and avenge oor blude on thae that dwall on the yirth?” And thar was gien to them, ilk ane, a white robe; and it was tellʼt them that they soud rest their sels a wee while, till their marrows, and their brethren that soud be slain eʼen as they war, soud be aʼ fulfilled. And I saw whan he lowsed the sixth seal; thar was a great yirdin; and the sun was black as sack‐claith oʼ hair; and the hale mune becam as blude; And the starns oʼ heeven fell to the yirth, as a fig‐tree sheds her orra figs, whan shaken oʼ a michty winʼ. And the heeven slippit awa, as a scroll rowʼt‐up; and every mountain and isle war movʼt oot oʼ their stances. And the kings oʼ the yirth, and the nobles, and rulers oʼ thoosands, and the rich, and the michty, and ilka thirlman, and ilka freeman, hid theirsels iʼ the caves and iʼ the dens oʼ the mountains, Sayin to the mountains and the craigs, “Faʼ on us! and beild us frae the face oʼ him wha sits on the Thron, and frae the wrath oʼ the Lamb! “For the great day oʼ their wrath is come; and wha is fit to staun?” Eftir thir things I saw fowr Angels staunin on the fowr corners oʼ the yirth, haudin siccar the fowr wins oʼ the yirth, that nae winʼ soud blaw on the yirth, or on the sea, or on ony tree. And I saw anither Angel come up frae the sunrisin, haein the seal oʼ the leevin God, and he cryʼt oot wiʼ a soondin voice to the fowr Angels to wham it was gien to bring skaith on the yirth and the sea, Sayin, “Ye maunna skaith the yirth, nor the sea, nor the trees, to we hae sealʼt the servants oʼ oor God on their broos.” And I heard the number oʼ thae sealʼt: a hunner and forty‐fowr thoosand; sealʼt oot oʼ every  tribe oʼ the sons oʼ Israʼl. Oot oʼ Judahʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand sealʼt; oot oʼ Reubenʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Gadʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; Oot oʼ Asherʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Naphaliʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Manassehʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand. Oot oʼ Simeonʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Leviʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Issacharʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; Oot oʼ Zabulonʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Josephʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand; oot oʼ Benjaminʼs tribe, twalʼ thoosand sealʼt. Eftir this I lookit, and see! an unco number, that nae man could tell, oot oʼ aʼ nations and kith, and folk, and speech, stude afore the Thron, and fornent the Lamb, dinkʼt in white, wiʼ palms iʼ their hauns. And cryʼt oot heigh, “Salvation to oor God, wha sits on the Thron, and to the Lamb!” And aʼ the Angels war stannin iʼ the compass oʼ the Thron, and roond‐aboot the Elders and the fowr leevin‐anes; and fell doon afore the Thron on their faces, worshippin God, And quoʼ they, “Eʼen sae: Blessin, and glorie, and wisdom, and giean oʼ thanks, and honour, and pooer, and micht be to oor God, for evir and evir mair!” And ane oʼ the Elders answerʼt, and quoʼ he tae me, “Wha are thir, buskit aʼ in white? and whaur cam they frae?” And quoʼ I tae him, “My lord, ye ken!” And quoʼ he tae me, “Thir are the anes that cam oot oʼ sair and unco tossins‐aboot, and hae made their cleedin white iʼ the blude oʼ the Lamb. “Sae are they iʼ the presence oʼ the Thron oʼ God, and serʼ him day and nicht in his Temple: and the Ane that sits on the Thron sal unfauld his tent ower him. “And they sal hunger nae mair, and gang drouthie nae mair; nor sal the sun smite them, nor ony heat‐blast. “For the Lamb frae the mids oʼ the Throne sal herd them, and sal airt them to the watirs oʼ the waal‐ee oʼ Life; and God sal dicht awaʼ ilka tear frae their eʼen!” And whaneʼer he openʼt the seeventh seal, a quateness fell in Heeven as it was for half‐an-ʼoor. And I saw the seeven Angels wha staun iʼ the presence oʼ God; and thar war giean to them seeven buglehorns. And anither Angel cam and stude at the altar, wiʼ a gowden censer; and thar was giean to him muckle incense, that he micht pit it wiʼ the prayers oʼ the saunts, pittin them on the gowden altar that is fornent the Thron. And the reek oʼ the incense gaed up, wiʼ the prayers oʼ the saunts, oot oʼ the Angelʼs hauns, afore God. And the Angel took the censer, and fillʼt it wiʼ the lowin coals oʼ the altar, and cuist it on the yirth; and thar cam thunners, and voices, and lichtnins, and a yirdin. And the seeven Angels, thae haein the seeven buglehorns, made theirsels ready that they soud soond. And the  first ane soondit: and hail and lowe, mixʼt in blude, war cuisten on the yirth; and the third‐pairt oʼ the yirth was burnt‐up, and the third‐pairt oʼ the trees was burnt up, and aʼ green foggage was burnt up. And the second Angel soondit; and as it war a great mountain, lowin wiʼ fire, was cuisten into the sea; and the third‐pairt oʼ the sea becam blude. And the third‐pairt oʼ the beass that war iʼ the sea, that had life, deeʼt; and the third‐pairt oʼ the ships war destroyʼt. And the third Angel soondit; and frae heeven fell a great starn, lowin like a lamp; and it fell on a third‐pairt oʼ the rivers, and on the heid‐springs oʼ the watirs; And the name oʼ the starn is caʼd “Worm‐wud”; and the third‐pairt oʼ the watirs becam wormwud, and mony deeʼt oʼ the watirs, for they war made bitter. And the fowrth Augel soondit; and the third‐pairt oʼ the sun was smitten, and the third‐pairt oʼ the mune, and the third‐pairt oʼ the starns; and the third‐pairt oʼ them soud be made mirk, and the day soudna glint for a third‐pairt oʼt, nor yet the nicht. And I saw, and I hearkenʼt to an eagle flyin throwe the mids oʼ the lift, cryin wiʼ a soondin voice, “Wae, wae, wae! for thae that dwall on the yirth, by reason oʼ the lave oʼ the voices oʼ the buglehorns oʼ the thrie Angels that hae yet to soond!” And the fifth Angel soondit; and I saw a starn that had faun oot oʼ heeven to the yirth; and thar was gien to him the key oʼ the pit oʼ the abyss. And he unsteekit the pit oʼ the abyss; and reek cam up oot oʼ the pit, as the reek oʼ a great furnace; and the sun and the lift war darkenʼt wiʼ the reek oʼ the pit. And oot oʼ the reek cam locusts on the yirth; and pooer was gien them, as the scorpions oʼ the yirth hae power. And it was bidden them that they soudna skaith the foggage oʼ the yirth, nor yet ony green thing, nor yet ony tree, but only the men wha haena the seal oʼ God on their broo. And it was gien to them that they soudna slay them, but that they soud be tormentit fyve months; and the torment oʼ them was like a scorpionʼs torment, whan it may strike a man. And iʼ thae days sal men seek for death, and no find it; and desire to dee, and death flees frae them. And the likeness of the locusts was as horses made ready for war; and on their heids war like croons oʼ gowd; and their faces as faces oʼ men; And their hair as the hair oʼ weemen; and their teeth like lionsʼ teeth; And they had cuirasses as graith oʼ airn; and the noise oʼ their wings as the noise oʼ chariots, as oʼ mony horses rushin to battle. And they had tails like scorpions, tails like stings; and iʼ their tails is pooer to skaith men for fyve months. And they had a king ower them, an angel oʼ the abyss; his name in Hebrew is “Abaddon,” and in oor common tongue he has a name “Destroyer.” Ae wae is past; tak tent! thar are comin yet twa mair waes eftir thir things! And the saxth Angel soondit; and I heard a voice frae the horns oʼ the gowden altar, iʼ the presence oʼ God, Sayin to the saxth Angel, “Ye that hae the buglehorn! lowse the fowr Angels that are in bonds at the great river Euphrates!” And the fowr Angels war lowsed, wha had been made ready for the ʼoor, and day, and month, and year, that they soud slay the third‐pairt oʼ men. And the number oʼ the hosts oʼ horsemen, twa million: I heard the number oʼ them. And I saw the horses iʼ the vision, and thae sittin on them; haein cuirasses as oʼ fire, and hyacinth, and brunstane; and the heids oʼ the horses as heids oʼ lions; and oot oʼ their mouʼ gangs  lowe, and reek, and brunstane. By thir thrie plagues war slain the third‐pairt oʼ men; by the lowe, and the reek, and the brunstane that cam oot oʼ their mouʼ. For the pooer oʼ the horses is iʼ their mouʼ and iʼ their tail; for their tails are like serpents, wiʼ heids; and wiʼ them they do skaith. And the lave oʼ men, wha warna slain by thir plagues, repentit‐na oʼ the warks oʼ their hauns, that they soudna serʼ demons, and eidols oʼ gowd, and siller, and oʼ brass, and oʼ stane, and oʼ wud; whilk can naither see, nor hear, nor gang: And they repentit‐na oʼ their blude‐sheddin, nor oʼ their incantations, nor oʼ their uncleanness, nor of their plunderins. And I saw anither, a michty Angel, comin doon oot oʼ Heeven, clad wiʼ a clud; and a rainbow on his heid; and his face as the sun, and his feet as lowin pillars. And he had in his haun a wee  bookie open; and he set his richt fit on the sea, and his left fit on the lanʼ; And cryʼt oot wiʼ a soondin voice, as a lion wad roar. And whan he cryʼt oot, seeven thunners spak wiʼ their voices. And when the seeven thunners spak I was gaun to write; and I heard a voice oot oʼ Heeven, sayin, “Bind ye up the things the seeven thunners spak, and write‐them‐na!” And the Angel I saw staunin on the sea and on the lanʼ, liftit his richt haun toward heeven, And swure by him wha leeves for evir‐and‐evir, wha creatit the heeven and aʼ thar‐in, and the yirth and aʼ thar‐in, and the sea and aʼ thar‐in, that “The delay was endit!” But iʼ the days oʼ the seeventh Angel, whaneʼer he soud begin to soond, soud be perfetit the secret oʼ God; conform to the Gude‐tidins he has declarʼt to his ain servants the prophets. And the voice I heard oot oʼ heeven heard I again talkin wiʼ me, and saying, “Awa! tak the wee bookie, the open ane, iʼ the haun oʼ the Angel that stauns on the sea and on the lanʼ.” And I gaed awa to the Angel, and says to him, “Gie the wee bookie to me!” And he says to me, “Tak it, and eat it up; and it sal be bitter within ye, but iʼ yere mouʼ it sal be sweet as hinny!” And I took the wee bookie oot oʼ the Angelʼs haun, and ate it up; and it was iʼ my mouʼ as hinny sweet; and whan I had eaten it, it was bitter within me. And quoʼ they to me, “Ye maun prophesie yet again to mony folk, and nations, and tongues, and kings!” And thar was gien me a reed like to a wand; and it was said, “Rise ye, and  measur the temple oʼ God, and the altar, and aʼ that worship thar! “And the coort that is ootside the Temple leaʼ ye ootside, and measur‐it‐na; for it is gien ower to the nations: and the holie citie wull they tramp doon forty‐twa months. “And I wull gie to my Twa Witnesses, and they sal prophesie twal‐hunner and saxty days, cleedit in sack‐claith. “Thir are the twa olive‐trees, and the twa lamp‐bearers, whilk staun iʼ the presence oʼ the God oʼ the haill yirth. “And gif ony man wad do them skaith, a lowe comes oot oʼ their mouʼ and devoors their faes; and gif ony ane wad do them skaith, sae maun he be slain. “Thir hae the pooer to steek heeven, that thar be nae rain or weet iʼ the days oʼ their prophesyin; and hae pooer ower the watirs, to turn them intil blude; and to smite the yirth wiʼ aʼ plagues, as aft as they wull. “And, at siccan a time as they sal perfete their witnessin, the beasʼ that comes up oot oʼ the abyss wull mak war wiʼ them, and owercome them, and slay them. “And their corses wull lie on the braid causey oʼ the great citie, whilk spiritually is caʼd Sodom, and Egypt, whaur eʼen their Lord was crucifyʼt. “And a wheen frae ʼmang the folk, and tribes, and tongues, and nations look on their corses, thrie days and a hauf, and they dinna alloo their corses to be putten in a tomb. “And they that dwall on the yirth rejoice ower them, and are blythe; and they send presents ane to anither; for thir twa prophets wadna lat‐be them dwallin on the yirth. “And eftir the thrie days and a hauf, a spirit oʼ life frae God enters them; and they stude on their feet: and muckle fear fell on thae behauldin them. “And they heard a soondin voice oot oʼ Heeven, sayin to them, ‘Come ye up here!’ And they gaed up intil Heeven, in a clud; and their faes saw them. “And in that same ʼoor, thar cam an unco yirdin, and the tenth‐pairt oʼ the citie was whammlʼt owre; and thar war slain by the yirdin, names oʼ men seeven thoosand: and the lave war fleyʼt, and gied glorie to the God oʼ Heeven. “The second wae is past; and behauld! the third wae is comin on.” And the seeventh Angel soondit; and thar war lood voices in Heeven, sayin, “The Kingdom oʼ the Warld is come to be the Kingdom oʼ oor Lord, and oʼ his Anointit; and he sal reign for evir and aye!” And the fowr‐and‐twenty Elders, wha sit on their throns, fell on their faces, and adored God, sayin, “We gie thee thanks, O Lord God Almichty, wha Is, and wha Was, for that thou hast taen thy great pooer, and did become King. “And the nations war offendit; and thine angʼer cam, and the time oʼ the deid to be judged; and to gie reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saunts, and to thae wha reverence thy name, smaʼ and great; and to destroy them that destroy the yirth!” And the Temple oʼ God that is in Heeven was unsteekit, and the Ark oʼ his Covenant in his Temple was seen; and thar cam fire‐flauchts, and voices, and thunner, and a yirdin, and unco hail. And an unco sign appearʼt in Heeven: a  wumman cleedit wiʼ the sun, and the moon aneath her feet, and on her heid a croon oʼ twalʼ starns. And, bein a mither‐to‐be, she cryʼt oot in bearin‐pains, and in anguish, to be deliverʼt. And anither ferlie appearʼt in Heeven; and mark! a great rid Dragon, wiʼ seeven heids and ten horns; and on his heid seeven croons; And his tail taiglʼt the third pairt oʼ the starns oʼ the heeven, and dashʼt them tae the Yirth. And the Dragon stude afore the wumman, wha was bein deliverʼt, to devoor her bairn as sune as she was deliverʼt. And she brocht forth a lad‐bairn, a hero‐son, wha soud sway aʼ nations wiʼ a sceptre oʼ airn; and her son was waftit awa to God and to his Thron. And the wumman fled to the wilderness, whaur she had a howff preparʼt for her oʼ God; and thar sal they nourice her twal hunner and saxty days. And War begude in Heeven: Michael and his Angels makin war wiʼ the Dragon; and the Dragon made war, and his angels; And they owercam‐na, nor was a stance founʼ for them ony mair in Heeven. And harlʼt doon was the great Dragon, the auld serpent, he that is caʼd “Deevil,” and “Satan,” he that wrangs the hail yirth — he was cuisʼn‐doon tae the yirth; and his angels war cuisʼn‐doon wiʼ him. And I heard a soondin voice in Heeven, sayin, “Noo comes the salvation, and the pooer, and the kingdom oʼ oor God, and the pooer oʼ his Anointit! for the Accuser oʼ oor brethren is cuisten‐doon, he that was wytin them afore oor God day and nicht. “And they prevailʼt again him, throwe the blude oʼ the Lamb, and by the word oʼ their witnessin; and they loʼed‐na their life, eʼen on to death. “For this be blythe, O Heevens! and aʼ ye that in them dwall! Wae for the yirth, and for the sea! for the fae has gane doon intil you: haein muckle wrath, kennin he has but a wee while.” And whan the Dragon saw he was cuisʼn‐doon tae the yirth, he pursued the wumman, she wha brocht forth the hero‐son. And to the wumman war gien the twa wings oʼ the great eagle, that she soud flee into the wilderness, into the howff; whaur she is to be nouriced a season, and seasons, and hauf a season, frae the serpentʼs face. And the serpent belched‐forth, eftir the wumman, watir like a river, that he micht mak her to be carryʼt awa wiʼ the spate. And the yirth helpit the wumman; and the yirth openʼt her mouʼ, and swallowʼt up the spate that the Dragon belched‐forth frae his mooth. And the Dragon was fuʼ oʼ wrath again the wumman, and he gaed awa to mak war wiʼ the lave oʼ her bairns, thae that war keepin the commauns oʼ God, and haudin the testimonie oʼ Jesus. And he stude upon the sand oʼ the sea. And I saw a beast comin up oot oʼ the sea, haein ten horns and seeven heids, and on his horns ten croons, and his heids bure the names oʼ blasphemie. And the beast I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet like as oʼ a bear, and his mooth as a lionʼs mooth; and the Dragon gied him the pooer that he had, and his thron, and great authoritie. And I saw ane frae ʼmang his heids as it war thrust‐throwe to the deid; and his deid‐straik was healed; and aʼ the warld ferlie at the beast. And they gied worship to the Dragon, for giean sic pooer to the beast; and they gied worship to the beast, sayin, “Wha can marrow the beast? Wha can mak war wiʼ him!” And thar was gien to him a mouʼ speakin unco things, and blasphemies; and thar war gien him authoritie for forty‐twa months. And he openʼt his mouʼ in blasphemies again God; to miscaʼ his name, and his tabernacle, and thae that dwall in Heeven. And it was gien to him to mak war wiʼ the saunts, and to owercome them. And thar was gien him authoritie ower aʼ tribes, and folk, and tongues, and nations. And they wull worship him aʼ they that dwall on the yirth, ilk ane whase name isna putten‐doon iʼ the Buik‐oʼ‐Life oʼ the Lamb that was slain frae the fundation oʼ the warld. Gif ony ane has hearin, lat him hear. Gif ony man is for bonds, intil bonds he gangs; gif ony man wiʼ sword wull slay, by sword sal he be slain. Here is the tholin and the lealness oʼ the saunts! And I saw anither beast comin up oot oʼ the yird; and he had twa horns like a lamb, and he was speakin like a dragon. And he sways the pooer oʼ the first beast in his presence; and gars the yirth and aʼ its dwallers worship the first beast, wha was healed oʼ his deid‐straik. And he dis great ferlies, eʼen to gar lowe to come doon oot oʼ the lift, afore the sicht oʼ men: And he beguiles them that dwall on the yirth, wiʼ the ferlies it was gien him to do iʼ the sicht oʼ the beast, and commauns thae that dwall on the yirth to mak an image to the beast, wha had a deid‐straik oʼ a sword, and leeved. And it was gien him to gie breath to the image oʼ the beast, that the image oʼ the beast micht eʼen speak; and gar as mony as wadna gie worship to the image oʼ the beast to be slain. And he gars aʼ, smaʼ and great, and the rich and the puir, the free and the enthrallʼt, that they soud be brandit on their richt‐haun, or on their broo; And that nane soud hae pooer to buy or to troke, but he that has the mark, the name oʼ the beast, or the number oʼ his name. Here is discernment: he that is wyss lat him coont‐up the number oʼ the beast; for it is the number oʼ a man, and his number is sax hunner and saxty‐sax. And I saw, and behauld! the Lamb, staunin on Mount Zion; and wiʼ him a hunner and forty‐fowr thoosand, wiʼ his name and his Faitherʼs name inscrivʼt on their broo. And I heard a voice oot oʼ Heeven, as the soondin oʼ mony watirs, as an unco voice oʼ thunner; and the voice that I heard was as oʼ harpers, soondin on their harps. And they sing a new Sang, in presence oʼ the Thron, and in presence oʼ the fowr leevin‐anes, and oʼ the Elders; and nae man could ken the Sang but the hunner and forty‐fowr thoosand that war ransomed frae the yirth. Thir are they that are‐na defiled in incontinency; for they are pure. Thir are they wha follow the Lamb whaursaeʼer he may lead; thir war ransomed frae ʼmang men, a first‐frute for God and the Lamb. And iʼ their mouʼ was nae guile; for they are wyteless. And I saw anither Angel, flyin iʼ the mids oʼ the lift, haein the evir‐durin Gude‐news to deliver to thae that dwall on the yirth, eʼen to ilka nation, and tribe, and tongue, and folk. Cryin wiʼ a soonding voice, “Revere God, and gie him laud; for the ʼoor oʼ his judgment has come; and gie ye worship to him who made the Heevens and the Yirth, and the sea, and the waal‐ees oʼ watirs.” And anither, a second Angel, followʼt sayin, “Babylon, the michty, is faun, is faun! wha garʼt aʼ nations to drink oʼ the wine oʼ the wrath oʼ her lecherie!” And anither Angel, a third, followʼt wiʼ them, cryin wiʼ a soondin voice, “Gin ony ane worships the beast and his image, and taks the brand on his broo, or on his haun, “He eke sal drink oʼ the wine oʼ the wrath oʼ God, whilk is teemed oot unmixed iʼ the cup oʼ his wrath; and sal be tormentit in lowe and brunstane iʼ the presence oʼ holie Angels, and iʼ the presence oʼ the Lamb.” And the reek oʼ their torment gangs up for evir and evir; and they hae nae ease day nor nicht, they that worship the beast and his image, and gin ony ane taks the brand oʼ his name. Here is the tholin iʼ the saunts, they wha keep Godʼs commauns, and their lealness to Jesus! And I heard a voice oot oʼ heeven sayin, “Write ye! Happy the deid wha dee iʼ the Lord, frae this oot! Aye, testifies the Spirit, that they may rest frae aʼ their weary moil, and their warks gang wiʼ them!” And I saw, and look! a white clud; and on the clud Ane sittin, like tae the Son oʼ Man, wiʼ a croon oʼ gowd upon his heid, and in his haun a shairp sickle. And anither Angel cam forth oot oʼ the Temple, cryin oot wiʼ a soonding voice to him that was sittin on the clud, “Pit in thy heuk and  shear; for the ʼoor to shear has come; for the hairst oʼ the yirth is ripe.” And he that sat on the clud swung in his heuk on the yirth, and the yirth was hairstit. And anither Angel came oot oʼ the Temple that was in heeven, he too haein a shairp heuk. And anither Angel came forth frae the altar, haein pooer ower fire; and he cryʼt wiʼ a soondin voice to him that had the shairp heuk, sayin, “Pit in yere heuk, and gaither ye the clusters oʼ the vine‐stock oʼ the yirth! for her grapes are fu ripe!” And the Angel swung his heuk intil the yirth, and gatherʼt in the vintage oʼ the yirth; and cuist it intil the great wine‐press oʼ the wrath oʼ God. And the wine‐press was trampit ayont the citie yetts; and forth cam blude oot oʼ the wine‐press, eʼen to the horse‐bridles, the length oʼ twa‐hunner mile. And I saw anither ferlie in heeven, unco and wunnerfuʼ; seeven Angels, haein seeven plagues — the last — for in them was endit the wrath oʼ God. And I saw ʼan it war a glessy sea, glintin bricht; and they that had gotten the victory ower the beast, and ower his image, and ower his brand, and ower the number oʼ his name, stude on the glessy sea, haein the harps oʼ God. And they sing the Sang oʼ Moses the servant oʼ God, and the Sang oʼ the Lamb, sayin, “Unco and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almichty; richtous and true are thy ways, thou King oʼ Nations! “Wha wadna fear thee, O Lord, and laud heigh thy name! For thou only art holie; for aʼ nations sal come and loot doon afore thee; for thy holie commauns are made kent.” And eftir the things I saw the Temple oʼ the Tabernacle oʼ Testimonie unsteekit in heeven. And forth cam the seeven Angels, thae haein the seeven plagues, oot oʼ the Temple; buskit wiʼ jewels, pure and bricht; and girdit roond the breist wiʼ bands oʼ gowd. And ane frae ʼmang the fowr leevin‐anes  gied tae the Angels seeven gowden flagons, fuʼ oʼ the wrath oʼ God, he wha leeves for evir and evir. And the Temple was fuʼ oʼ reek, frae the glorie oʼ God, and frae his pooer; and nane could gang intil the Temple, till the seeven plagues oʼ the seeven Angels war endit. And I hearkened to a soondin voice oot oʼ the Temple, cryin to the seeven Angels, “Awa! and teem oot the seeven flagons oʼ the wrath oʼ God on the yirth!” And the first gaed awa, and teemed oot his flagon on the yirth; and thar cam a waesome and sair blain on the men who had the brand oʼ the beast, and on thae giean worship to his image. And the second teemed oot his flagon into the sea, and it becam blude, as oʼ ane that was deid; and every life deeʼt iʼ the sea. And the third teemed oot his flagon into the rivers and waal‐ees oʼ watir; and becam blude. And I heard the Angel oʼ the watirs sayin, “Richtous art thou, the Ane wha Is, and the Ane wha Was, the Holie Ane, for that thou hast sae judged; “For the blude oʼ thy saunts hae they shed; and blude thou hast gien them to drink; for they are wordie oʼt.” And I heard frae the altar, sayin, “Eʼen say, Lord God Almichty; true and richtous are thy judgments.” And the fourth Angel teemed oot his flagon upon the sun; and it was gien to it to birsle men wiʼ heat. And they war birslʼt wiʼ an unco birslin; and men miscaʼt the name oʼ God, wha had pooer ower thir plagues; and they repentit‐na, to gie him glorie. And the fifth Angel teemed oot his flagon on the thron oʼ the beast; and his kingdom was made mirk; and they gnashʼt at their ain tongues wiʼ pain; And miscaʼt the God oʼ Heeven on accoont oʼ their pain, and for thir blains; and didna turn frae their warks. And the saxth Angel teemed oot his flagon on the great river Euphrates, and its watir was lickit‐up, that the comin oʼ the kings frae the sun‐risin may be made ready. And I saw three unclean spirits, as puddocks, come oot oʼ the mooth oʼ the Dragon, and oot oʼ the mooth oʼ the beast, and oot oʼ the mooth oʼ the fause‐prophet. For they are demonsʼ spirits, workin ferlies; whilk come forth to the kings oʼ the haill yirth, to gaither them togither to the battle oʼ the great Day oʼ God Almichty. “Behauld I come, as comes a thief! happy he wha is on gaird, and keeping his cleedin, least he gang bare, and they see his shame.” And they gaitherʼt thegither intil a place that is caʼd iʼ the Hebrew, “Mountain oʼ Megiddo.” And the seeventh teemed oot his flagon in the air, and a voice cam oot oʼ the Temple, frae the Thron, sayin, “It has come to be!” And thar cam fire‐flauchts, and voices, and thunners; and a yirdin cam, sic a ane as neʼer cam aboot syn men war on the yirth, sic an unco yirthquake, sae great. And the great citie was pairtit in thrie parts, and the cities oʼ the nation war whummlʼt; and Babylon the Great cam to mind afore God, to gie to her the cup oʼ the wrath oʼ his displeasur. And ilka isle fled awa, and the mountains war‐na mair fund. And unco hail, as oʼ a hauf‐hunnerwecht, cam doon oot oʼ the heeven upon men. And the men miscaʼt God, on accoont oʼ the hail; for the weird oʼt was unco. And thar cam oot ane oʼ the seeven Angels, thae haein the seeven flagons, and spak wiʼ me, and quoʼ he, “Come! and I wull schaw ye the judgment oʼ the great harlot, that sits on mony waters, “Wiʼ wham the kings oʼ the yirth hae committit uncleanness, and thae dwallin on the yirth hae been made drucken, oot oʼ the wine oʼ her lecherie.” And he carryʼt me awa iʼ the Spirit intil the wilderness; and I saw a wumman sittin on a scarlet beast, whilk was fuʼ oʼ names oʼ blasphemie, wiʼ seeven heids and ten horns. And the wumman was buskit in purple and scarlet, and was dinkit oot wiʼ gowd and jewels and pearls, haudin a gowden cup in her haun fuʼ oʼ abomination, eʼen the abomination oʼ her adulteries. And on her heid a name written, a mysterie: “Babylon the Great, Mither oʼ Harlots, and oʼ the abominations oʼ the Yirth!” And I saw the wumman drucken wiʼ the blude oʼ the saunts, and wiʼ the blude oʼ the martyrs oʼ Jesus, and I ferlied whan I saw her, wiʼ an unco ferliein. And the Angel said to me, “Hoo did ye ferlie? I wull tell ye the secret oʼ the wumman, and oʼ the beast that bears her, that has the seeven heids and the ten horns. “The beast that ye saw was, and is‐na, is to rise frae the abyss, and gangs awa to destruction. And thae that dwall on the yirth sal ferlie, whase names hae no been putten‐doon iʼ the Buik‐oʼ‐Life frae the fundation oʼ the warld, at behauldin the beast, hoo that he was, and is‐na, and sal come. “Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seeven heids are seeven mountains, whaur the wumman sits. “And they are seeven kings; the fyve fell; the ane is; and the ither isna yet come; and whan he comes, he maun bide for a wee while. “And the beast whilk was, and is‐na, eʼen he is the auchth, and is oʼ the seeven; and gangs awa intil destruction. “And the ten horns ye saw are ten kings; wha hae gotten nae kingdom as yet, but hae pooer gien them ae ʼoor wiʼ the beast. “Thir are oʼ ae mind, and they gie their pooer and authoritie to the beast. “Thir mak war wiʼ the Lamb, and the Lamb wull prevail again them; for he is Lord oʼ the lordly, and King oʼ the kingly; and thae that are wiʼ him are bidden, and chosen and leal!” And quoʼ he to me, “The watirs ye did see, whaur the harlot is sittin, are folk, and thrangs, and nations, and tongues. “And the ten horns ye saw, and the beast, thir wull hate the harlot, and wull mak her bare and nakit, and wull eat her flesh, and burn her up wiʼ fire. “For God pat iʼ their hearts to fulfil his mind, and to be aʼ oʼ ae mind, and gie their kingdom to the beast, till aʼ Godʼs words come to pass. “And the wumman ye saw is the great citie;  she that has a kingdom ower the kings oʼ the yirth.” And eftir thir things I saw anither Angel comin doon oot oʼ Heeven, haein great pooer; and the yirth was lichtit up wiʼ his glorie. And he cryʼt oot wiʼ a michty voice, sayin, “Faun, faun, is Babylon the great! and come to be the howff oʼ demons, and a dungeon oʼ ilka vile spirit, and a hauld oʼ ilka unclean and abominable bird. “For by the wine oʼ the wrath oʼ her adulteries have faun aʼ the nations; and the kings oʼ the yirth committit adultery wiʼ her: and the mairchants oʼ the yirth, oot oʼ the pooer oʼ her wantonness made theirsels rich.” And I heard anither voice frae Heeven, sayin, “Come forth oot oʼ her, my folk! that ye may hae nae marrowin wiʼ her sins, and get‐na oʼ her plagues! “For her sins war heapit‐up to the heevens, and God has brocht her ill‐deeds to mind. “Gie ye to her eʼen as she hersel has gien, and dooble ye to her the dooble, conform to her wark: in the cup she has made fou, fill ye to her the dooble. “As muckle as she magnifyʼt hersel and leeved daintily, by sae muckle gie her torment and wae; for in her heart she was sayin, ‘I sit a queen, and am‐na weedowʼt, and sal see murnin nane!’ “And sae, in ae day sal come her waes; death and murnin, and famine; and wiʼ fire sal she be brunt‐up: for michty is the Lord God, he wha judges her. “And the kings oʼ the yirth, that committit adultery wiʼ her, and leeved wantonly wiʼ her, sal weep and wail ower her, whan they see the reek oʼ her burnin; “Staunin far‐awa, for the fear oʼ her torment, sayin, ‘Wae, wae! the great citie, the michty citie; for in ae ʼoor has her judgment faun!’ “And the mairchants oʼ the yirth greet and mak maen for her, for that their  mairchandise nae ane buys ony mair. “Mairchandise oʼ gowd, and oʼ siller, and oʼ jewels and pearls, and oʼ fine linen, and oʼ purple, and silk, and scarlet, and ilka sort oʼ odorous wud, and ilka thing oʼ ivorie, and ilka thing made oʼ maist precious wud, and oʼ brass, and oʼ airn, and oʼ marble, “And cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and perfume, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and nowte, and sheep, and oʼ horses, and chariots, and oʼ bodies and lives oʼ men. “And the frutes yere saul socht eftir hae depairtit frae ye, and aʼ the dainty and delicate things hae perishʼt frae ye, and in naegate sal they be funʼ. “The trokers iʼ thae things, they wha becam rich frae her, wull staun far‐awa, for the fear oʼ her torment, greetin and makin maen; “Sayin, ‘Wae, wae! the michty citie, that had buskit hersel wiʼ fine linen, and purple and scarlet, and had dinkʼt hersel oot wiʼ gowd, and jewel and pearl; in ae ʼoor has been laid waste sic walth as this!’ “And ilka captain, and ilka ane gaun to sea, stude far‐awa, “And cryʼt oot, behauldin the reek oʼ her burnin, sayin, ‘Whatna citie like to this great citie!’ “And they cuist stoor on their heids, and cryʼt alood, greetin and makin maen, sayin, ‘Wae, wae! the michty citie, in whilk waxʼt rich aʼ thae haein ships on the sea, oot oʼ her luxuries. In ae ʼoor is she laid waste!’ “Be blythe ower her, O Heeven! And aʼ ye saunts, and Apostles, and prophets! for God has judged her for yere sakes.” And an Angel, a michty ane, liftit up a stane, like a great mill‐stane, and cuist it into the sea, sayin, “Sae, wiʼ unco micht sal be hurled doon the great citie, Babylon; and in naegate ony mair be funʼ. “And voice oʼ harpers, and minstrels, and pipers, and buglers, sal be heard in ye nae mair! And ony craftsman oʼ ony craft, sal be funʼ in ye nae mair! And the soond oʼ a milʼstane sal be heard in ye nae mair! “And the licht oʼ a crusie sal nae mair shine in ye. And the voice oʼ bridegroom and oʼ bride sal be nae mair heard in ye! For thy mairchants war nobles on the yirth; for that aʼ the nations war beguiled by her sorceries. “And the blude oʼ prophets and saunts was funʼ in her, and oʼ aʼ thae that had been slain upon the yirth.” Eftir thir things I heard as a soondin voice oʼ an unco thrang in Heeven, and they said, “Hallelujah! The salvation, and the glorie, and the pooer oʼ oor God! “For true and holie are his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot, wha corruptit the yirth wiʼ her adulteries; and he has avenged the blude oʼ his servants at her haun!” And again they cryʼt, “Hallelujah!” And her reek gangs up for evir and evir. And the fowr‐and‐twenty Elders, and the fowr leevin‐anes loutit doun, and worshipped God, that sits on the Thron, sayin, “Eʼen sae! Hallelujah!” And a voice cam oot frae the Thron, sayin, “Gie ye praise to oor God, aʼ ye his servants, and thae that reverence him, baith smaʼ and great!” And I heard the voice as oʼ an unco thrang, and as the voice oʼ michty thunners, sayin, “Hallelujah! for the Lord oor God, the Almichty, is King! “Lat us rejoice, exultin, and gie laud to him; for the bridal oʼ the Lamb has come, and his bride has made hersel ready. “And it was gien to her that she soud busk hersel in fine linen, bricht and pure; for the fine linen is the holie deeds oʼ the Saunts.” And he said to me, “Write ye, Happy thae wha are bidden to the mairriage‐supper oʼ the Lamb!” And he says to me, “Thir words are the aefauld words oʼ God.” And I loutit doon afore his feet, to do reverence to him. And he says to me, “No sae! for I am a fellow‐servant wiʼ ye, and oʼ yere brethren wha haud the testimonie oʼ Jesus: gie God worship; for the testimonie oʼ Jesus is the heart oʼ the prophecie.” And I saw the Heevens unsteekit, and lo! a white horse: and he that sat onʼt was caʼd “Leal and True”; and in holiness judges he, and gangs to war. And his eʼen lowin fire; and on his heid mony croons; and has a name written whilk nae ane kens but his ain sel; And he war cleedit in a mantle drookit wiʼ blude, and his name is caʼd, “The Word oʼ God.” And the airmies oʼ Heeven followʼt wiʼ him, on white horses, clad in fine linen, white and pure. And oot oʼ his mooth gangs a shairp twa‐moothʼt sword, that sae he may smite the nations; and he wull shepherd them wiʼ a sceptre oʼ airn, while he tramps the press oʼ the wine oʼ the wrath oʼ God the Almichty. And he has, on his mantle and on his thigh, a name placed: “King oʼ the kingly, and Lord oʼ the lordly!” And I saw an Angel staunin iʼ the sun; and he cryʼt wiʼ a soondin voice, sayin to aʼ the birds fleein in mid‐air, “Come ye, and gaither thegither to the great supper oʼ God. “That ye may feast on the flesh oʼ kings, and flesh oʼ captains, and the flesh oʼ michty anes, and flesh oʼ horses, and oʼ thae that sit on them; and flesh oʼ aʼ, baith free and bond, baith smaʼ and great!” And I saw the beast, and the kings oʼ the yirth, and their hosts, gaitherʼt thegither to war wiʼ him that sat on the horse, and wiʼ his airmy. And the beast was taen, and wiʼ him the fause‐prophet, he that did the ferlies afore him, by whilk he beguiled thae that took the brand oʼ the beast, and thae giean worship to his image; and the twa war cuisten, leevin, intil the loch oʼ fire, lowin wiʼ brunstane. And the lave war slain by the sword oʼ him that sat on the horse, the sword that gaed forth oot oʼ his mooth; and aʼ the ravenin birds war filled wiʼ their flesh. And I saw an Angel comin doon frae Heeven, haein the key oʼ the abyss, and a muckle chain in his haun. And he laid haud oʼ the Dragon, the auld serpent, wha is “Deevil,” and “Sautan,” and chained him for a thoosand year, And harled him intil the abyss, and steekit it, and sealʼt it aboon him, that he soud nae mair beguile the nations, to the end oʼ the Thoosand‐year; and eftir that he bude be lowsed a wee while. And I saw throns, and they sat on them; and judgment‐pooer was gien to them; and I saw the sauls oʼ them that war beheidit for the testimonie oʼ Jesus, and for the word oʼ God; and sae mony as worshipped‐na the beast nor his image, and took‐na the brand on the broo, nor on the haun; and they leeved wiʼ Christ, and reigned wiʼ him, a thoosand year. And the lave oʼ the deid leeved‐na till soud be endit the thoosand year. This is the “First Risin‐again.” Happy and holie he, wha has pairt in the First Risin‐again! ower siclike the second death has nae pooer; but they sal be the priests oʼ God and oʼ Christ, and sal reign wiʼ him for the Thoosand Year! And, whaneʼer the Thoosand Year is endit, Sautan wull be lowsed oot oʼ his thrall, And wull gang oot to beguile the nations, that are iʼ the fowr corners oʼ the yirth, Gog and Magog, to gaither them thegither for the war, oʼ wham the number is as the sand oʼ the sea. And they cam up, spread‐oot ower the breidth oʼ the yirth; and rinkit‐roond the camp oʼ the saunts, and the weel‐loʼed citie: and fire cam doon frae God, oot oʼ Heeven, and devoorʼt them. And the fae, he that was beguilin them, was cuisten intil the loch oʼ fire and brunstane, whaur eke war cuisten the beast and the fause‐prophet; and they sal be tormentit day and nicht, for evir and evir. And I saw a Great White Thron, and him that sat on it; frae whase face the heeven and yirth fled awa, and place wasna fund for them. And I saw the deid, the great and the smaʼ, staun afore the Thron, and buiks war unsealʼt; and anither buik was unsealʼt, whilk is the Buik‐oʼ‐Life; and the deid war judged oot oʼ the things that war putten‐doon iʼ the buiks, conform to their warks. And the sea gied up the deid that war inʼt, and Death and the Grave gied up the deid that war in them; and they war judged, ilka ane, conform to their warks. And Death and the Grave war cuisten intil the loch oʼ fire: this is the Second Death, the lowin loch. And gin ony ane wasna fund putten‐doon iʼ the Buik‐oʼ‐Life, he was cuisten intil the lowin loch. And I saw a New Heeven and a New Yirth; for the first Heeven and the first Yirth war gane‐by; and sea was thar nane. And the holie city, “New Jerusalem,” saw I comin doon frae God oot oʼ Heeven, made ready as a bride buskit for her bridegroom. And I heard a soondin voice oot oʼ Heeven, sayin, “Lo! Godʼs dwallin is wiʼ men, and he sal bide wiʼ them; and they sal be his folk, and God his ain sel sal be wiʼ them! “And he sal dicht aʼ tears frae their een; and Death sal be nae mair; nor dool, nor ootcry, nor pain sal be ony mair: for aʼ the auld things are gane‐by!” And he that sat on the Thron, said, “Lo! I mak aʼ things ower again!” And he says to me, “Write; for thir words are leal and true!” And he said to me, “It has come to be! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the forefront and the endin! I to ilka drouthie ane wull gie oʼ the waal‐ee oʼ the Watir‐oʼ‐Life, freely. “He that prevails has aʼ things for his heritage; and I sal be to him a God, and he sal be to me a bairn. “But as to the dauntit anes, and the unbelievin, and the abominable, and blude‐shedders, and lecherers, and eidol‐worshippers, and aʼ leears, their pairt is in the loch that lowes wiʼ fire and brunstane, whilk is the second death.” And thar cam oot ane oʼ the seeven Angels that had the seeven flagons fuʼ oʼ the seeven last plagues and spak wiʼ me, sayin, “Come awaʼ! I wull schaw ye the Bride, the wife oʼ the Lamb!” And he bure me awaʼ iʼ the Spirit to a mountain great and heigh, and airtit my een to the citie, the holie Jerusalem, loutin doon oot oʼ Heeven frae God; Haein the glorie oʼ God; and her glintin was like to a stane maist precious, as a jasper‐stane, clear as crystal; Haein a waʼ great and heigh; and had twalʼ ports, and at the ports twalʼ Angels: and names putten thar‐on, whilk are the names oʼ the twalʼ tribes oʼ Israʼl. Eastward, thrie ports; and northward thrie ports; and soothward thrie ports; and wastward thrie ports. And the city waʼs had twalʼ fundations; and upoʼ them twalʼ names, oʼ the twalʼ Apostles oʼ the Lamb. And he that spak to me had a wand oʼ gowd, that he micht measur the citie, and her portals and her waʼ. And the citie lies four‐square, and the lenth is as muckle as the breidth. And he measurʼt the citie wiʼ the wand, up to twalʼ thoosand furlongs: her lenth, and breidth in heicht aʼ marrow thegither. And he measurʼt her waʼ a hunner and forty‐fowr half‐airms oʼ a manʼs measur; that is, the Angelʼs. And the biggin oʼ the waʼ was jasper; and the citie pure gowd, like shinin gless, And the fundations oʼ the waʼ oʼ the citie wiʼ ilka precious stane war buskit. The first fundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedonie; the fourth, emerant; The fifth, sardonix; the saxth, cornelian; the seeventh, gowd‐stane; the auchth, beryl; the ninth, topaz: the tenth, chrysoprasie; the eleeventh, hyacinth; the twalʼth, amethyst. And the twalʼ yetts war twalʼ pearls; ilka allenar yett ae pearl; and the causey oʼ the citie was gowd, like shinin gless. And Temple saw I nane thar‐in; for the Lord God Almichty and the Lamb are her temple! And the citie isna wantin for the sun, nor yet for the mune, that they soud be shinin inʼt; for the glorie oʼ God is her licht, and the Lamb is the lamp oʼt. And aʼ folk sal gang by the licht oʼt; and aʼ the kings oʼ the yirth bring their glorie intilʼt. And aʼ the day lang the yetts are wide unsteekit; for nae  nicht faʼs thar! And they sal bring the glorie and treasur oʼ the nations intilʼt. And in naegate sal enter intilʼt ocht that defiles, nor ane that dis abomination, or is a leear; but thae wha are putten‐doon iʼ the Lambʼs Buik‐oʼ‐Life. And he airtit my een to a river oʼ the Watir oʼ Life, as clear as crystal, flowin oot frae the Thron oʼ God and the Lamb. And atween the river‐street and the river, on this side and on yon, the Tree oʼ Life, giean twalʼ frutins; month by month giean its frute; and the leaves oʼ the tree to mak the nations hale. And nae curse sal be ony mair; and the Thron oʼ God and oʼ the Lamb in her sal be; and his servitors sal do him service. And they sal look on his face; wiʼ his name carryʼt on their broo. And nae nicht sal faʼ mair; and they need nae licht oʼ lamp nor shine oʼ sun; for the Lord God wull shed licht upon them; and they sal reign for evir and aye. And he said to me, “Thir sayins are leal and true; and the Lord, the God oʼ the spirits oʼ the prophets, has sent oot his Angel to schaw to his servants whatna things wull sune come to pass. “And lo! I come wiʼ speed; happy he wha keeps the words oʼ the prophecie oʼ this buik.” And I, John, am he that heard and saw thir things; and whan I heard and saw, I loutit doon afore the feet oʼ the Angel, wha was schawin me thir things. And quoʼ he to me, “No sae!

I come wiʼ speed, and my reward is wiʼ me, to bestow on ilk ane eʼen as his wark sal be. “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the forefront and the endin. “Blessed they wha wesh their robes; that they may hae richt to the Tree oʼ Life; and may gang in by the ports intil the citie! “Ootby are the dowgs and sorcerers, and the lecherers, and blude‐shedders, and ilka ane that loʼes or maks a lee. “I, Jesus, sent my Angel to witness to ye thir things iʼ the kirks.

He that wull, lat him hae the Watir oʼ Life freely! “I bear witness to ilka ane hearin the words oʼ the prophecie oʼ this buik:— Gin ony ane pits ocht mair on them, God wull pit on him the plagues that are putten‐doon in this buik. “And gin ony ane taks awaʼ frae the words oʼ the buik oʼ this prophecie, God wull tak awaʼ his pairt frae the Tree oʼ Life, and frae the Holie Citie, eʼen frae the things that are putten‐doon iʼ this buik. “He that bears witness oʼ thir things says, ‘Aye! I come wiʼ speed!’ Eʼen sae! Come, Lord Jesus!” The lovin‐favor oʼ the Lord Jesus be wiʼ the saunts! THE END.
