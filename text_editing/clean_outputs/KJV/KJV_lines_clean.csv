20,MAT,1,KJV,fourteen generations and from david until the carrying away into babylon
21,MAT,1,KJV,are
22,MAT,1,KJV,fourteen generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ
23,MAT,1,KJV,are
24,MAT,1,KJV,fourteen generations
25,MAT,1,KJV,now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost
26,MAT,1,KJV,then joseph her husband being a just
27,MAT,1,KJV,man
28,MAT,1,KJV,and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily
29,MAT,1,KJV,but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost
30,MAT,1,KJV,and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
31,MAT,1,KJV,now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying
32,MAT,1,KJV,behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son
33,MAT,1,KJV,and they shall call his name emmanuel
34,MAT,1,KJV,which being interpreted is god with us
35,MAT,1,KJV,then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife
36,MAT,1,KJV,and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus
37,MAT,2,KJV,now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem
38,MAT,2,KJV,saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him
39,MAT,2,KJV,when herod the king had heard
40,MAT,2,KJV,these things
41,MAT,2,KJV,he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
42,MAT,2,KJV,and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born
43,MAT,2,KJV,and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet
44,MAT,2,KJV,and thou bethlehem
45,MAT,2,KJV,in
46,MAT,2,KJV,the land of juda
47,MAT,2,KJV,art not the least among the princes of juda
48,MAT,2,KJV,for out of thee shall come a governor
49,MAT,2,KJV,that shall rule my people israel
50,MAT,2,KJV,then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared
51,MAT,2,KJV,and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found
52,MAT,2,KJV,him
53,MAT,2,KJV,bring me word again that i may come and worship him also
54,MAT,2,KJV,when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was
55,MAT,2,KJV,when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
56,MAT,2,KJV,and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh
57,MAT,2,KJV,and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way
58,MAT,2,KJV,and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
59,MAT,2,KJV,when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt
60,MAT,2,KJV,and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son
61,MAT,2,KJV,then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men
62,MAT,2,KJV,then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying
63,MAT,2,KJV,in rama was there a voice heard
64,MAT,2,KJV,lamentation and weeping and great mourning
65,MAT,2,KJV,rachel weeping
66,MAT,2,KJV,for
67,MAT,2,KJV,her children
68,MAT,2,KJV,and would not be comforted because they are not
69,MAT,2,KJV,but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt
70,MAT,2,KJV,saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young childs life
71,MAT,2,KJV,and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel
72,MAT,2,KJV,but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee
73,MAT,2,KJV,and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene
74,MAT,3,KJV,in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea
75,MAT,3,KJV,and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
76,MAT,3,KJV,for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying
77,MAT,3,KJV,the voice of one crying in the wilderness
78,MAT,3,KJV,prepare ye the way of the lord
79,MAT,3,KJV,make his paths straight
80,MAT,3,KJV,and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey
81,MAT,3,KJV,then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan
82,MAT,3,KJV,and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins
83,MAT,3,KJV,but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
84,MAT,3,KJV,bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance
85,MAT,3,KJV,and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to
86,MAT,3,KJV,our
87,MAT,3,KJV,father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
88,MAT,3,KJV,and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
89,MAT,3,KJV,i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and
90,MAT,3,KJV,with
91,MAT,3,KJV,fire
92,MAT,3,KJV,whose fan
93,MAT,3,KJV,is
94,MAT,3,KJV,in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
95,MAT,3,KJV,then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him
96,MAT,3,KJV,but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me
97,MAT,3,KJV,and jesus answering said unto him
98,MAT,3,KJV,suffer
99,MAT,3,KJV,it to be so
100,MAT,3,KJV,now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness
101,MAT,3,KJV,then he suffered him
102,MAT,3,KJV,and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him
103,MAT,3,KJV,and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
104,MAT,4,KJV,then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
105,MAT,4,KJV,and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred
106,MAT,4,KJV,and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread
107,MAT,4,KJV,but he answered and said
108,MAT,4,KJV,it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
109,MAT,4,KJV,then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple
110,MAT,4,KJV,and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written
111,MAT,4,KJV,he shall give his angels charge concerning thee
112,MAT,4,KJV,and in
113,MAT,4,KJV,their
114,MAT,4,KJV,hands they shall bear thee up
115,MAT,4,KJV,lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
116,MAT,4,KJV,jesus said unto him
117,MAT,4,KJV,it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
118,MAT,4,KJV,again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
119,MAT,4,KJV,and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me
120,MAT,4,KJV,then saith jesus unto him
121,MAT,4,KJV,get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
122,MAT,4,KJV,then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him
123,MAT,4,KJV,now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee
124,MAT,4,KJV,and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim
125,MAT,4,KJV,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
126,MAT,4,KJV,the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim
127,MAT,4,KJV,by
128,MAT,4,KJV,the way of the sea beyond jordan
129,MAT,4,KJV,galilee of the gentiles
130,MAT,4,KJV,the people which sat in darkness
131,MAT,4,KJV,saw great light
132,MAT,4,KJV,and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death
133,MAT,4,KJV,light is sprung up
134,MAT,4,KJV,from that time jesus began to preach and to say
135,MAT,4,KJV,repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
136,MAT,4,KJV,and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
137,MAT,4,KJV,and he saith unto them
138,MAT,4,KJV,follow me and i will make you fishers of men
139,MAT,4,KJV,and they straightway left
140,MAT,4,KJV,their
141,MAT,4,KJV,nets and followed him
142,MAT,4,KJV,and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james
143,MAT,4,KJV,the son
144,MAT,4,KJV,of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them
145,MAT,4,KJV,and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
146,MAT,4,KJV,and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
147,MAT,4,KJV,and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them
148,MAT,4,KJV,and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and
149,MAT,4,KJV,from
150,MAT,4,KJV,decapolis and
151,MAT,4,KJV,from
152,MAT,4,KJV,jerusalem and
153,MAT,4,KJV,from
154,MAT,4,KJV,judaea and
155,MAT,4,KJV,from
156,MAT,4,KJV,beyond jordan
157,MAT,5,KJV,and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him
158,MAT,5,KJV,and he opened his mouth and taught them saying
159,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
160,MAT,5,KJV,are
161,MAT,5,KJV,the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
162,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
163,MAT,5,KJV,are
164,MAT,5,KJV,they that mourn for they shall be comforted
165,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
166,MAT,5,KJV,are
167,MAT,5,KJV,the meek for they shall inherit the earth
168,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
169,MAT,5,KJV,are
170,MAT,5,KJV,they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
171,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
172,MAT,5,KJV,are
173,MAT,5,KJV,the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
174,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
175,MAT,5,KJV,are
176,MAT,5,KJV,the pure in heart for they shall see god
177,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
178,MAT,5,KJV,are
179,MAT,5,KJV,the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god
180,MAT,5,KJV,blessed
181,MAT,5,KJV,are
182,MAT,5,KJV,they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
183,MAT,5,KJV,blessed are ye when
184,MAT,5,KJV,men
185,MAT,5,KJV,shall revile you and persecute
186,MAT,5,KJV,you
187,MAT,5,KJV,and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake
188,MAT,5,KJV,rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
189,MAT,5,KJV,is
190,MAT,5,KJV,your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
191,MAT,5,KJV,ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men
192,MAT,5,KJV,ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid
193,MAT,5,KJV,neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house
194,MAT,5,KJV,let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
195,MAT,5,KJV,think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil
196,MAT,5,KJV,for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
197,MAT,5,KJV,whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach
198,MAT,5,KJV,them
199,MAT,5,KJV,the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
200,MAT,5,KJV,for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed
201,MAT,5,KJV,the righteousness
202,MAT,5,KJV,of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
203,MAT,5,KJV,ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
204,MAT,5,KJV,but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire
205,MAT,5,KJV,therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee
206,MAT,5,KJV,leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift
207,MAT,5,KJV,agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison
208,MAT,5,KJV,verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
209,MAT,5,KJV,ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery
210,MAT,5,KJV,but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
211,MAT,5,KJV,and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast
212,MAT,5,KJV,it
213,MAT,5,KJV,from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not
214,MAT,5,KJV,that
215,MAT,5,KJV,thy whole body should be cast into hell
216,MAT,5,KJV,and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast
217,MAT,5,KJV,it
218,MAT,5,KJV,from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not
219,MAT,5,KJV,that
220,MAT,5,KJV,thy whole body should be cast into hell
221,MAT,5,KJV,it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement
222,MAT,5,KJV,but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
223,MAT,5,KJV,again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths
224,MAT,5,KJV,but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne
225,MAT,5,KJV,nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
226,MAT,5,KJV,neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black
227,MAT,5,KJV,but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil
228,MAT,5,KJV,ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
229,MAT,5,KJV,but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
230,MAT,5,KJV,and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have
231,MAT,5,KJV,thy
232,MAT,5,KJV,cloke also
233,MAT,5,KJV,and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain
234,MAT,5,KJV,give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
235,MAT,5,KJV,ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy
236,MAT,5,KJV,but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you
237,MAT,5,KJV,that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
238,MAT,5,KJV,for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same
239,MAT,5,KJV,and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more
240,MAT,5,KJV,than others
241,MAT,5,KJV,do not even the publicans so
242,MAT,5,KJV,be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
243,MAT,6,KJV,take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
244,MAT,6,KJV,therefore when thou doest
245,MAT,6,KJV,thine
246,MAT,6,KJV,alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward
247,MAT,6,KJV,but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
248,MAT,6,KJV,that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
249,MAT,6,KJV,and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
250,MAT,6,KJV,are
251,MAT,6,KJV,for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward
252,MAT,6,KJV,but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
253,MAT,6,KJV,but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen
254,MAT,6,KJV,do
255,MAT,6,KJV,for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
256,MAT,6,KJV,be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him
257,MAT,6,KJV,after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
258,MAT,6,KJV,thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as
259,MAT,6,KJV,it is
260,MAT,6,KJV,in heaven
261,MAT,6,KJV,give us this day our daily bread
262,MAT,6,KJV,and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
263,MAT,6,KJV,and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen
264,MAT,6,KJV,for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
265,MAT,6,KJV,but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
266,MAT,6,KJV,moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward
267,MAT,6,KJV,but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face
268,MAT,6,KJV,that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
269,MAT,6,KJV,lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal
270,MAT,6,KJV,but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal
271,MAT,6,KJV,for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
272,MAT,6,KJV,the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light
273,MAT,6,KJV,but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great
274,MAT,6,KJV,is
275,MAT,6,KJV,that darkness
276,MAT,6,KJV,no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
277,MAT,6,KJV,therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment
278,MAT,6,KJV,behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they
279,MAT,6,KJV,which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature
280,MAT,6,KJV,and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin
281,MAT,6,KJV,and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
282,MAT,6,KJV,wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven
283,MAT,6,KJV,shall he
284,MAT,6,KJV,not much more
285,MAT,6,KJV,clothe
286,MAT,6,KJV,you o ye of little faith
287,MAT,6,KJV,therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed
288,MAT,6,KJV,for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things
289,MAT,6,KJV,but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
290,MAT,6,KJV,take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day
291,MAT,6,KJV,is
292,MAT,6,KJV,the evil thereof
293,MAT,7,KJV,judge not that ye be not judged
294,MAT,7,KJV,for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
295,MAT,7,KJV,and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
296,MAT,7,KJV,or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam
297,MAT,7,KJV,is
298,MAT,7,KJV,in thine own eye
299,MAT,7,KJV,thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye
300,MAT,7,KJV,give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you
301,MAT,7,KJV,ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
302,MAT,7,KJV,for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
303,MAT,7,KJV,or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone
304,MAT,7,KJV,or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent
305,MAT,7,KJV,if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
306,MAT,7,KJV,therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets
307,MAT,7,KJV,enter ye in at the strait gate for wide
308,MAT,7,KJV,is
309,MAT,7,KJV,the gate and broad
310,MAT,7,KJV,is
311,MAT,7,KJV,the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat
312,MAT,7,KJV,because strait
313,MAT,7,KJV,is
314,MAT,7,KJV,the gate and narrow
315,MAT,7,KJV,is
316,MAT,7,KJV,the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
317,MAT,7,KJV,beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves
318,MAT,7,KJV,ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles
319,MAT,7,KJV,even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
320,MAT,7,KJV,a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither
321,MAT,7,KJV,can
322,MAT,7,KJV,a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
323,MAT,7,KJV,every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
324,MAT,7,KJV,wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
325,MAT,7,KJV,not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
326,MAT,7,KJV,many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works
327,MAT,7,KJV,and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
328,MAT,7,KJV,therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock
329,MAT,7,KJV,and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock
330,MAT,7,KJV,and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand
331,MAT,7,KJV,and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
332,MAT,7,KJV,and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine
333,MAT,7,KJV,for he taught them as
334,MAT,7,KJV,one
335,MAT,7,KJV,having authority and not as the scribes
336,MAT,8,KJV,when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him
337,MAT,8,KJV,and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
338,MAT,8,KJV,and jesus put forth
339,MAT,8,KJV,his
340,MAT,8,KJV,hand and touched him saying
341,MAT,8,KJV,i will be thou clean
342,MAT,8,KJV,and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
343,MAT,8,KJV,and jesus saith unto him
344,MAT,8,KJV,see thou tell no man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them
345,MAT,8,KJV,and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him
346,MAT,8,KJV,and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented
347,MAT,8,KJV,and jesus saith unto him
348,MAT,8,KJV,i will come and heal him
349,MAT,8,KJV,the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed
350,MAT,8,KJV,for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this
351,MAT,8,KJV,man
352,MAT,8,KJV,go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth
353,MAT,8,KJV,it
354,MAT,8,KJV,
355,MAT,8,KJV,when jesus heard
356,MAT,8,KJV,it
357,MAT,8,KJV,he marvelled and said to them that followed
358,MAT,8,KJV,verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel
359,MAT,8,KJV,and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
360,MAT,8,KJV,but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
361,MAT,8,KJV,and jesus said unto the centurion
362,MAT,8,KJV,go thy way and as thou hast believed
363,MAT,8,KJV,so
364,MAT,8,KJV,be it done unto thee
365,MAT,8,KJV,and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour
366,MAT,8,KJV,and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes mother laid and sick of a fever
367,MAT,8,KJV,and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them
368,MAT,8,KJV,when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with
369,MAT,8,KJV,his
370,MAT,8,KJV,word and healed all that were sick
371,MAT,8,KJV,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare
372,MAT,8,KJV,our
373,MAT,8,KJV,sicknesses
374,MAT,8,KJV,now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side
375,MAT,8,KJV,and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
376,MAT,8,KJV,and jesus saith unto him
377,MAT,8,KJV,the foxes have holes and the birds of the air
378,MAT,8,KJV,have
379,MAT,8,KJV,nests but the son of man hath not where to lay
380,MAT,8,KJV,his
381,MAT,8,KJV,head
382,MAT,8,KJV,and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father
383,MAT,8,KJV,but jesus said unto him
384,MAT,8,KJV,follow me and let the dead bury their dead
385,MAT,8,KJV,and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him
386,MAT,8,KJV,and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep
387,MAT,8,KJV,and his disciples came to
388,MAT,8,KJV,him
389,MAT,8,KJV,and awoke him saying lord save us we perish
390,MAT,8,KJV,and he saith unto them
391,MAT,8,KJV,why are ye fearful o ye of little faith
392,MAT,8,KJV,then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
393,MAT,8,KJV,but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him
394,MAT,8,KJV,and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way
395,MAT,8,KJV,and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time
396,MAT,8,KJV,and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding
397,MAT,8,KJV,so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine
398,MAT,8,KJV,and he said unto them
399,MAT,8,KJV,go
400,MAT,8,KJV,and when they were come out they went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters
401,MAT,8,KJV,and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the city and told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils
402,MAT,8,KJV,and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought
403,MAT,8,KJV,him
404,MAT,8,KJV,that he would depart out of their coasts
405,MAT,9,KJV,and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own city
406,MAT,9,KJV,and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy
407,MAT,9,KJV,son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee
408,MAT,9,KJV,and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this
409,MAT,9,KJV,man
410,MAT,9,KJV,blasphemeth
411,MAT,9,KJV,and jesus knowing their thoughts said
412,MAT,9,KJV,wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
413,MAT,9,KJV,for whether is easier to say
414,MAT,9,KJV,thy
415,MAT,9,KJV,sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
416,MAT,9,KJV,but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins
417,MAT,9,KJV,then saith he to the sick of the palsy
418,MAT,9,KJV,arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house
419,MAT,9,KJV,and he arose and departed to his house
420,MAT,9,KJV,but when the multitudes saw
421,MAT,9,KJV,it
422,MAT,9,KJV,they marvelled and glorified god which had given such power unto men
423,MAT,9,KJV,and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him
424,MAT,9,KJV,follow me
425,MAT,9,KJV,and he arose and followed him
426,MAT,9,KJV,and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples
427,MAT,9,KJV,and when the pharisees saw
428,MAT,9,KJV,it
429,MAT,9,KJV,they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners
430,MAT,9,KJV,but when jesus heard
431,MAT,9,KJV,that
432,MAT,9,KJV,he said unto them
433,MAT,9,KJV,they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick
434,MAT,9,KJV,but go ye and learn what
435,MAT,9,KJV,that
436,MAT,9,KJV,meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
437,MAT,9,KJV,then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not
438,MAT,9,KJV,and jesus said unto them
439,MAT,9,KJV,can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast
440,MAT,9,KJV,
441,MAT,9,KJV,no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse
442,MAT,9,KJV,neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved
443,MAT,9,KJV,while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live
444,MAT,9,KJV,and jesus arose and followed him and
445,MAT,9,KJV,so did
446,MAT,9,KJV,his disciples
447,MAT,9,KJV,and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind
448,MAT,9,KJV,him
449,MAT,9,KJV,and touched the hem of his garment
450,MAT,9,KJV,for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole
451,MAT,9,KJV,but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said
452,MAT,9,KJV,daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole
453,MAT,9,KJV,and the woman was made whole from that hour
454,MAT,9,KJV,and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise
455,MAT,9,KJV,he said unto them
456,MAT,9,KJV,give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth
457,MAT,9,KJV,and they laughed him to scorn
458,MAT,9,KJV,but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose
459,MAT,9,KJV,and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
460,MAT,9,KJV,and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying
461,MAT,9,KJV,thou
462,MAT,9,KJV,son of david have mercy on us
463,MAT,9,KJV,and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them
464,MAT,9,KJV,believe ye that i am able to do this
465,MAT,9,KJV,they said unto him yea lord
466,MAT,9,KJV,then touched he their eyes saying
467,MAT,9,KJV,according to your faith be it unto you
468,MAT,9,KJV,and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them saying
469,MAT,9,KJV,see
470,MAT,9,KJV,that
471,MAT,9,KJV,no man know
472,MAT,9,KJV,it
473,MAT,9,KJV,but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that country
474,MAT,9,KJV,as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil
475,MAT,9,KJV,and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel
476,MAT,9,KJV,but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils
477,MAT,9,KJV,and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people
478,MAT,9,KJV,but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd
479,MAT,9,KJV,then saith he unto his disciples
480,MAT,9,KJV,the harvest truly
481,MAT,9,KJV,is
482,MAT,9,KJV,plenteous but the labourers
483,MAT,9,KJV,are
484,MAT,9,KJV,few
485,MAT,9,KJV,pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
486,MAT,10,KJV,and when he had called unto
487,MAT,10,KJV,him
488,MAT,10,KJV,his twelve disciples he gave them power
489,MAT,10,KJV,against
490,MAT,10,KJV,unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease
491,MAT,10,KJV,now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james
492,MAT,10,KJV,the son
493,MAT,10,KJV,of zebedee and john his brother
494,MAT,10,KJV,philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james
495,MAT,10,KJV,the son
496,MAT,10,KJV,of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus
497,MAT,10,KJV,simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him
498,MAT,10,KJV,these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying
499,MAT,10,KJV,go not into the way of the gentiles and into
500,MAT,10,KJV,any
501,MAT,10,KJV,city of the samaritans enter ye not
502,MAT,10,KJV,but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
503,MAT,10,KJV,and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
504,MAT,10,KJV,heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give
505,MAT,10,KJV,provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses
506,MAT,10,KJV,nor scrip for
507,MAT,10,KJV,your
508,MAT,10,KJV,journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat
509,MAT,10,KJV,and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence
510,MAT,10,KJV,and when ye come into an house salute it
511,MAT,10,KJV,and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you
512,MAT,10,KJV,and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet
513,MAT,10,KJV,verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
514,MAT,10,KJV,behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves
515,MAT,10,KJV,but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues
516,MAT,10,KJV,and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles
517,MAT,10,KJV,but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak
518,MAT,10,KJV,for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you
519,MAT,10,KJV,and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against
520,MAT,10,KJV,their
521,MAT,10,KJV,parents and cause them to be put to death
522,MAT,10,KJV,and ye shall be hated of all
523,MAT,10,KJV,men
524,MAT,10,KJV,for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved
525,MAT,10,KJV,but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel till the son of man be come
526,MAT,10,KJV,the disciple is not above
527,MAT,10,KJV,his
528,MAT,10,KJV,master nor the servant above his lord
529,MAT,10,KJV,it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house beelzebub how much more
530,MAT,10,KJV,shall they call
531,MAT,10,KJV,them of his household
532,MAT,10,KJV,fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known
533,MAT,10,KJV,what i tell you in darkness
534,MAT,10,KJV,that
535,MAT,10,KJV,speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear
536,MAT,10,KJV,that
537,MAT,10,KJV,preach ye upon the housetops
538,MAT,10,KJV,and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
539,MAT,10,KJV,are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father
540,MAT,10,KJV,but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
541,MAT,10,KJV,fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
542,MAT,10,KJV,whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven
543,MAT,10,KJV,but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven
544,MAT,10,KJV,think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword
545,MAT,10,KJV,for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
546,MAT,10,KJV,and a mans foes
547,MAT,10,KJV,shall be
548,MAT,10,KJV,they of his own household
549,MAT,10,KJV,he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
550,MAT,10,KJV,and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me
551,MAT,10,KJV,he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it
552,MAT,10,KJV,he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
553,MAT,10,KJV,he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward
554,MAT,10,KJV,and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold
555,MAT,10,KJV,water
556,MAT,10,KJV,only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward
557,MAT,11,KJV,and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities
558,MAT,11,KJV,now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples
559,MAT,11,KJV,and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another
560,MAT,11,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
561,MAT,11,KJV,go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see
562,MAT,11,KJV,the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them
563,MAT,11,KJV,and blessed is
564,MAT,11,KJV,he
565,MAT,11,KJV,whosoever shall not be offended in me
566,MAT,11,KJV,and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john
567,MAT,11,KJV,what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind
568,MAT,11,KJV,but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft
569,MAT,11,KJV,clothing
570,MAT,11,KJV,are in kings houses
571,MAT,11,KJV,but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet
572,MAT,11,KJV,for this is
573,MAT,11,KJV,he
574,MAT,11,KJV,of whom it is written
575,MAT,11,KJV,behold i send my messenger before thy face
576,MAT,11,KJV,which shall prepare thy way before thee
577,MAT,11,KJV,verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
578,MAT,11,KJV,and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force
579,MAT,11,KJV,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
580,MAT,11,KJV,and if ye will receive
581,MAT,11,KJV,it
582,MAT,11,KJV,this is elias which was for to come
583,MAT,11,KJV,he that hath ears to hear let him hear
584,MAT,11,KJV,but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows
585,MAT,11,KJV,and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented
586,MAT,11,KJV,for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil
587,MAT,11,KJV,the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of her children
588,MAT,11,KJV,then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not
589,MAT,11,KJV,woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
590,MAT,11,KJV,but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you
591,MAT,11,KJV,and thou capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day
592,MAT,11,KJV,but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee
593,MAT,11,KJV,at that time jesus answered and said
594,MAT,11,KJV,i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes
595,MAT,11,KJV,even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
596,MAT,11,KJV,all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and
597,MAT,11,KJV,he
598,MAT,11,KJV,to whomsoever the son will reveal
599,MAT,11,KJV,him
600,MAT,11,KJV,come unto me all
601,MAT,11,KJV,ye
602,MAT,11,KJV,that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
603,MAT,11,KJV,take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls
604,MAT,11,KJV,for my yoke
605,MAT,11,KJV,is
606,MAT,11,KJV,easy and my burden is light
607,MAT,12,KJV,at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat
608,MAT,12,KJV,but when the pharisees saw
609,MAT,12,KJV,it
610,MAT,12,KJV,they said unto him behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day
611,MAT,12,KJV,but he said unto them
612,MAT,12,KJV,have ye not read what david did when he was an hungred and they that were with him
613,MAT,12,KJV,how he entered into the house of god and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priests
614,MAT,12,KJV,or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless
615,MAT,12,KJV,but i say unto you that in this place is
616,MAT,12,KJV,one
617,MAT,12,KJV,greater than the temple
618,MAT,12,KJV,but if ye had known what
619,MAT,12,KJV,this
620,MAT,12,KJV,meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless
621,MAT,12,KJV,for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day
622,MAT,12,KJV,and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue
623,MAT,12,KJV,and behold there was a man which had
624,MAT,12,KJV,his
625,MAT,12,KJV,hand withered and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that they might accuse him
626,MAT,12,KJV,and he said unto them
627,MAT,12,KJV,what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift
628,MAT,12,KJV,it
629,MAT,12,KJV,out
630,MAT,12,KJV,how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days
631,MAT,12,KJV,then saith he to the man
632,MAT,12,KJV,stretch forth thine hand
633,MAT,12,KJV,and he stretched
634,MAT,12,KJV,it
635,MAT,12,KJV,forth and it was restored whole like as the other
636,MAT,12,KJV,then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him
637,MAT,12,KJV,but when jesus knew
638,MAT,12,KJV,it
639,MAT,12,KJV,he withdrew himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all
640,MAT,12,KJV,and charged them that they should not make him known
641,MAT,12,KJV,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
642,MAT,12,KJV,behold my servant whom i have chosen
643,MAT,12,KJV,my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased
644,MAT,12,KJV,i will put my spirit upon him
645,MAT,12,KJV,and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles
646,MAT,12,KJV,he shall not strive nor cry
647,MAT,12,KJV,neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets
648,MAT,12,KJV,a bruised reed shall he not break
649,MAT,12,KJV,and smoking flax shall he not quench
650,MAT,12,KJV,till he send forth judgment unto victory
651,MAT,12,KJV,and in his name shall the gentiles trust
652,MAT,12,KJV,then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw
653,MAT,12,KJV,and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david
654,MAT,12,KJV,but when the pharisees heard
655,MAT,12,KJV,it
656,MAT,12,KJV,they said this
657,MAT,12,KJV,fellow
658,MAT,12,KJV,doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils
659,MAT,12,KJV,and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them
660,MAT,12,KJV,every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand
661,MAT,12,KJV,and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand
662,MAT,12,KJV,and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast
663,MAT,12,KJV,them
664,MAT,12,KJV,out therefore they shall be your judges
665,MAT,12,KJV,but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you
666,MAT,12,KJV,or else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
667,MAT,12,KJV,he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
668,MAT,12,KJV,wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
669,MAT,12,KJV,against
670,MAT,12,KJV,the
671,MAT,12,KJV,holy
672,MAT,12,KJV,ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
673,MAT,12,KJV,and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the
674,MAT,12,KJV,world
675,MAT,12,KJV,to come
676,MAT,12,KJV,either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by
677,MAT,12,KJV,his
678,MAT,12,KJV,fruit
679,MAT,12,KJV,o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
680,MAT,12,KJV,a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
681,MAT,12,KJV,but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
682,MAT,12,KJV,for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
683,MAT,12,KJV,then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee
684,MAT,12,KJV,but he answered and said unto them
685,MAT,12,KJV,an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas
686,MAT,12,KJV,for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
687,MAT,12,KJV,the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas
688,MAT,12,KJV,is
689,MAT,12,KJV,here
690,MAT,12,KJV,the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon
691,MAT,12,KJV,is
692,MAT,12,KJV,here
693,MAT,12,KJV,when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none
694,MAT,12,KJV,then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth
695,MAT,12,KJV,it
696,MAT,12,KJV,empty swept and garnished
697,MAT,12,KJV,then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last
698,MAT,12,KJV,state
699,MAT,12,KJV,of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
700,MAT,12,KJV,while he yet talked to the people behold
701,MAT,12,KJV,his
702,MAT,12,KJV,mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him
703,MAT,12,KJV,then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee
704,MAT,12,KJV,but he answered and said unto him that told him
705,MAT,12,KJV,who is my mother and who are my brethren
706,MAT,12,KJV,and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said
707,MAT,12,KJV,behold my mother and my brethren
708,MAT,12,KJV,for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother
709,MAT,13,KJV,the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side
710,MAT,13,KJV,and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore
711,MAT,13,KJV,and he spake many things unto them in parables saying
712,MAT,13,KJV,behold a sower went forth to sow
713,MAT,13,KJV,and when he sowed some
714,MAT,13,KJV,seeds
715,MAT,13,KJV,fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up
716,MAT,13,KJV,some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth
717,MAT,13,KJV,and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
718,MAT,13,KJV,and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them
719,MAT,13,KJV,but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold
720,MAT,13,KJV,who hath ears to hear let him hear
721,MAT,13,KJV,and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables
722,MAT,13,KJV,he answered and said unto them
723,MAT,13,KJV,because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
724,MAT,13,KJV,for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath
725,MAT,13,KJV,therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand
726,MAT,13,KJV,and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith
727,MAT,13,KJV,by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand
728,MAT,13,KJV,and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive
729,MAT,13,KJV,for this peoples heart is waxed gross
730,MAT,13,KJV,and
731,MAT,13,KJV,their
732,MAT,13,KJV,ears are dull of hearing
733,MAT,13,KJV,and their eyes they have closed
734,MAT,13,KJV,lest at any time they should see with
735,MAT,13,KJV,their
736,MAT,13,KJV,eyes
737,MAT,13,KJV,and hear with
738,MAT,13,KJV,their
739,MAT,13,KJV,ears
740,MAT,13,KJV,and should understand with
741,MAT,13,KJV,their
742,MAT,13,KJV,heart
743,MAT,13,KJV,and should be converted and i should heal them
744,MAT,13,KJV,but blessed
745,MAT,13,KJV,are
746,MAT,13,KJV,your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
747,MAT,13,KJV,for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous
748,MAT,13,KJV,men
749,MAT,13,KJV,have desired to see
750,MAT,13,KJV,those things
751,MAT,13,KJV,which ye see and have not seen
752,MAT,13,KJV,them
753,MAT,13,KJV,and to hear
754,MAT,13,KJV,those things
755,MAT,13,KJV,which ye hear and have not heard
756,MAT,13,KJV,them
757,MAT,13,KJV,hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
758,MAT,13,KJV,when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth
759,MAT,13,KJV,it
760,MAT,13,KJV,not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side
761,MAT,13,KJV,but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it
762,MAT,13,KJV,yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended
763,MAT,13,KJV,he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
764,MAT,13,KJV,but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth
765,MAT,13,KJV,it
766,MAT,13,KJV,which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty
767,MAT,13,KJV,another parable put he forth unto them saying
768,MAT,13,KJV,the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
769,MAT,13,KJV,but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way
770,MAT,13,KJV,but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also
771,MAT,13,KJV,so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares
772,MAT,13,KJV,he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up
773,MAT,13,KJV,but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them
774,MAT,13,KJV,let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn
775,MAT,13,KJV,another parable put he forth unto them saying
776,MAT,13,KJV,the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field
777,MAT,13,KJV,which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof
778,MAT,13,KJV,another parable spake he unto them
779,MAT,13,KJV,the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
780,MAT,13,KJV,all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them
781,MAT,13,KJV,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying
782,MAT,13,KJV,i will open my mouth in parables
783,MAT,13,KJV,i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world
784,MAT,13,KJV,then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field
785,MAT,13,KJV,he answered and said unto them
786,MAT,13,KJV,he that soweth the good seed is the son of man
787,MAT,13,KJV,the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one
788,MAT,13,KJV,the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels
789,MAT,13,KJV,as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world
790,MAT,13,KJV,the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity
791,MAT,13,KJV,and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
792,MAT,13,KJV,then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
793,MAT,13,KJV,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
794,MAT,13,KJV,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
795,MAT,13,KJV,who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
796,MAT,13,KJV,again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind
797,MAT,13,KJV,which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away
798,MAT,13,KJV,so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just
799,MAT,13,KJV,and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
800,MAT,13,KJV,
801,MAT,13,KJV,jesus saith unto them
802,MAT,13,KJV,have ye understood all these things
803,MAT,13,KJV,they say unto him yea lord
804,MAT,13,KJV,then said he unto them
805,MAT,13,KJV,therefore every scribe
806,MAT,13,KJV,which is
807,MAT,13,KJV,instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
808,MAT,13,KJV,that is
809,MAT,13,KJV,an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure
810,MAT,13,KJV,things
811,MAT,13,KJV,new and old
812,MAT,13,KJV,and it came to pass
813,MAT,13,KJV,that
814,MAT,13,KJV,when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence
815,MAT,13,KJV,and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this
816,MAT,13,KJV,man
817,MAT,13,KJV,this wisdom and
818,MAT,13,KJV,these
819,MAT,13,KJV,mighty works
820,MAT,13,KJV,is not this the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joses and simon and judas
821,MAT,13,KJV,and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this
822,MAT,13,KJV,man
823,MAT,13,KJV,all these things
824,MAT,13,KJV,and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them
825,MAT,13,KJV,a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house
826,MAT,13,KJV,and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief
827,MAT,14,KJV,at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus
828,MAT,14,KJV,and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
829,MAT,14,KJV,for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put
830,MAT,14,KJV,him
831,MAT,14,KJV,in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife
832,MAT,14,KJV,for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her
833,MAT,14,KJV,and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet
834,MAT,14,KJV,but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod
835,MAT,14,KJV,whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask
836,MAT,14,KJV,and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger
837,MAT,14,KJV,and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded
838,MAT,14,KJV,it
839,MAT,14,KJV,to be given
840,MAT,14,KJV,her
841,MAT,14,KJV,
842,MAT,14,KJV,and he sent and beheaded john in the prison
843,MAT,14,KJV,and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought
844,MAT,14,KJV,it
845,MAT,14,KJV,to her mother
846,MAT,14,KJV,and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus
847,MAT,14,KJV,when jesus heard
848,MAT,14,KJV,of it
849,MAT,14,KJV,he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard
850,MAT,14,KJV,thereof
851,MAT,14,KJV,they followed him on foot out of the cities
852,MAT,14,KJV,and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick
853,MAT,14,KJV,and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals
854,MAT,14,KJV,but jesus said unto them
855,MAT,14,KJV,they need not depart give ye them to eat
856,MAT,14,KJV,and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two fishes
857,MAT,14,KJV,he said
858,MAT,14,KJV,bring them hither to me
859,MAT,14,KJV,and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to
860,MAT,14,KJV,his
861,MAT,14,KJV,disciples and the disciples to the multitude
862,MAT,14,KJV,and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full
863,MAT,14,KJV,and they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and children
864,MAT,14,KJV,and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away
865,MAT,14,KJV,and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone
866,MAT,14,KJV,but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary
867,MAT,14,KJV,and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea
868,MAT,14,KJV,and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear
869,MAT,14,KJV,but straightway jesus spake unto them saying
870,MAT,14,KJV,be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
871,MAT,14,KJV,and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water
872,MAT,14,KJV,and he said
873,MAT,14,KJV,come
874,MAT,14,KJV,and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus
875,MAT,14,KJV,but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me
876,MAT,14,KJV,and immediately jesus stretched forth
877,MAT,14,KJV,his
878,MAT,14,KJV,hand and caught him and said unto him
879,MAT,14,KJV,o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
880,MAT,14,KJV,and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased
881,MAT,14,KJV,then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god
882,MAT,14,KJV,and when they were gone over they came into the land of gennesaret
883,MAT,14,KJV,and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased
884,MAT,14,KJV,and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole
885,MAT,15,KJV,then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying
886,MAT,15,KJV,why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread
887,MAT,15,KJV,but he answered and said unto them
888,MAT,15,KJV,why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition
889,MAT,15,KJV,for god commanded saying honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death
890,MAT,15,KJV,but ye say whosoever shall say to
891,MAT,15,KJV,his
892,MAT,15,KJV,father or
893,MAT,15,KJV,his
894,MAT,15,KJV,mother
895,MAT,15,KJV,it is
896,MAT,15,KJV,a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me
897,MAT,15,KJV,and honour not his father or his mother
898,MAT,15,KJV,he shall be free
899,MAT,15,KJV,thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
900,MAT,15,KJV,ye
901,MAT,15,KJV,hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying
902,MAT,15,KJV,this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with
903,MAT,15,KJV,their
904,MAT,15,KJV,lips
905,MAT,15,KJV,but their heart is far from me
906,MAT,15,KJV,but in vain they do worship me
907,MAT,15,KJV,teaching
908,MAT,15,KJV,for
909,MAT,15,KJV,doctrines the commandments of men
910,MAT,15,KJV,and he called the multitude and said unto them
911,MAT,15,KJV,hear and understand
912,MAT,15,KJV,not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man
913,MAT,15,KJV,then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying
914,MAT,15,KJV,but he answered and said
915,MAT,15,KJV,every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
916,MAT,15,KJV,let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
917,MAT,15,KJV,then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable
918,MAT,15,KJV,and jesus said
919,MAT,15,KJV,are ye also yet without understanding
920,MAT,15,KJV,do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught
921,MAT,15,KJV,but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man
922,MAT,15,KJV,for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies
923,MAT,15,KJV,these are
924,MAT,15,KJV,the things
925,MAT,15,KJV,which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man
926,MAT,15,KJV,then jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon
927,MAT,15,KJV,and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord
928,MAT,15,KJV,thou
929,MAT,15,KJV,son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil
930,MAT,15,KJV,but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us
931,MAT,15,KJV,but he answered and said
932,MAT,15,KJV,i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
933,MAT,15,KJV,then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me
934,MAT,15,KJV,but he answered and said
935,MAT,15,KJV,it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast
936,MAT,15,KJV,it
937,MAT,15,KJV,to dogs
938,MAT,15,KJV,and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
939,MAT,15,KJV,then jesus answered and said unto her
940,MAT,15,KJV,o woman great
941,MAT,15,KJV,is
942,MAT,15,KJV,thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt
943,MAT,15,KJV,and her daughter was made whole from that very hour
944,MAT,15,KJV,and jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there
945,MAT,15,KJV,and great multitudes came unto him having with them
946,MAT,15,KJV,those that were
947,MAT,15,KJV,lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus feet and he healed them
948,MAT,15,KJV,insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of israel
949,MAT,15,KJV,then jesus called his disciples
950,MAT,15,KJV,unto him
951,MAT,15,KJV,and said
952,MAT,15,KJV,i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way
953,MAT,15,KJV,and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude
954,MAT,15,KJV,and jesus saith unto them
955,MAT,15,KJV,how many loaves have ye
956,MAT,15,KJV,and they said seven and a few little fishes
957,MAT,15,KJV,and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
958,MAT,15,KJV,and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake
959,MAT,15,KJV,them
960,MAT,15,KJV,and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude
961,MAT,15,KJV,and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken
962,MAT,15,KJV,meat
963,MAT,15,KJV,that was left seven baskets full
964,MAT,15,KJV,and they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and children
965,MAT,15,KJV,and he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the coasts of magdala
966,MAT,16,KJV,the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven
967,MAT,16,KJV,he answered and said unto them
968,MAT,16,KJV,when it is evening ye say
969,MAT,16,KJV,it will be
970,MAT,16,KJV,fair weather for the sky is red
971,MAT,16,KJV,and in the morning
972,MAT,16,KJV,it will be
973,MAT,16,KJV,foul weather to day for the sky is red and lowring o
974,MAT,16,KJV,ye
975,MAT,16,KJV,hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not
976,MAT,16,KJV,discern
977,MAT,16,KJV,the signs of the times
978,MAT,16,KJV,a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas
979,MAT,16,KJV,and he left them and departed
980,MAT,16,KJV,and when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread
981,MAT,16,KJV,then jesus said unto them
982,MAT,16,KJV,take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
983,MAT,16,KJV,and they reasoned among themselves saying
984,MAT,16,KJV,it is
985,MAT,16,KJV,because we have taken no bread
986,MAT,16,KJV,which
987,MAT,16,KJV,when jesus perceived he said unto them
988,MAT,16,KJV,o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread
989,MAT,16,KJV,do ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up
990,MAT,16,KJV,neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up
991,MAT,16,KJV,how is it that ye do not understand that i spake
992,MAT,16,KJV,it
993,MAT,16,KJV,not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
994,MAT,16,KJV,then understood they how that he bade
995,MAT,16,KJV,them
996,MAT,16,KJV,not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees
997,MAT,16,KJV,when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying
998,MAT,16,KJV,whom do men say that i the son of man am
999,MAT,16,KJV,and they said some
1000,MAT,16,KJV,say that thou art
1001,MAT,16,KJV,john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets
1002,MAT,16,KJV,he saith unto them
1003,MAT,16,KJV,but whom say ye that i am
1004,MAT,16,KJV,and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god
1005,MAT,16,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto him
1006,MAT,16,KJV,blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed
1007,MAT,16,KJV,it
1008,MAT,16,KJV,unto thee but my father which is in heaven
1009,MAT,16,KJV,and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
1010,MAT,16,KJV,and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
1011,MAT,16,KJV,then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ
1012,MAT,16,KJV,from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day
1013,MAT,16,KJV,then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee
1014,MAT,16,KJV,but he turned and said unto peter
1015,MAT,16,KJV,get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
1016,MAT,16,KJV,then said jesus unto his disciples
1017,MAT,16,KJV,if any
1018,MAT,16,KJV,man
1019,MAT,16,KJV,will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
1020,MAT,16,KJV,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it
1021,MAT,16,KJV,for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
1022,MAT,16,KJV,for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works
1023,MAT,16,KJV,verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
1024,MAT,17,KJV,and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart
1025,MAT,17,KJV,and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light
1026,MAT,17,KJV,and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him
1027,MAT,17,KJV,then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
1028,MAT,17,KJV,while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
1029,MAT,17,KJV,and when the disciples heard
1030,MAT,17,KJV,it
1031,MAT,17,KJV,they fell on their face and were sore afraid
1032,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus came and touched them and said
1033,MAT,17,KJV,arise and be not afraid
1034,MAT,17,KJV,and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only
1035,MAT,17,KJV,and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying
1036,MAT,17,KJV,tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead
1037,MAT,17,KJV,and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come
1038,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them
1039,MAT,17,KJV,elias truly shall first come and restore all things
1040,MAT,17,KJV,but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them
1041,MAT,17,KJV,then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist
1042,MAT,17,KJV,and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a
1043,MAT,17,KJV,certain
1044,MAT,17,KJV,man kneeling down to him and saying
1045,MAT,17,KJV,lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water
1046,MAT,17,KJV,and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him
1047,MAT,17,KJV,then jesus answered and said
1048,MAT,17,KJV,o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me
1049,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour
1050,MAT,17,KJV,then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out
1051,MAT,17,KJV,and jesus said unto them
1052,MAT,17,KJV,because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you
1053,MAT,17,KJV,howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
1054,MAT,17,KJV,and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them
1055,MAT,17,KJV,the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men
1056,MAT,17,KJV,and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again
1057,MAT,17,KJV,and they were exceeding sorry
1058,MAT,17,KJV,and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute
1059,MAT,17,KJV,money
1060,MAT,17,KJV,came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute
1061,MAT,17,KJV,he saith yes and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying
1062,MAT,17,KJV,what thinkest thou simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of strangers
1063,MAT,17,KJV,peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith unto him
1064,MAT,17,KJV,then are the children free
1065,MAT,17,KJV,notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee
1066,MAT,18,KJV,at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
1067,MAT,18,KJV,and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them
1068,MAT,18,KJV,and said
1069,MAT,18,KJV,verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
1070,MAT,18,KJV,whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
1071,MAT,18,KJV,and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me
1072,MAT,18,KJV,but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and
1073,MAT,18,KJV,that
1074,MAT,18,KJV,he were drowned in the depth of the sea
1075,MAT,18,KJV,woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
1076,MAT,18,KJV,wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast
1077,MAT,18,KJV,them
1078,MAT,18,KJV,from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire
1079,MAT,18,KJV,and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast
1080,MAT,18,KJV,it
1081,MAT,18,KJV,from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
1082,MAT,18,KJV,take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
1083,MAT,18,KJV,for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
1084,MAT,18,KJV,how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray
1085,MAT,18,KJV,and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that
1086,MAT,18,KJV,sheep
1087,MAT,18,KJV,than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
1088,MAT,18,KJV,even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
1089,MAT,18,KJV,moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother
1090,MAT,18,KJV,but if he will not hear
1091,MAT,18,KJV,thee then
1092,MAT,18,KJV,take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
1093,MAT,18,KJV,and if he shall neglect to hear them tell
1094,MAT,18,KJV,it
1095,MAT,18,KJV,unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican
1096,MAT,18,KJV,verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
1097,MAT,18,KJV,again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
1098,MAT,18,KJV,for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them
1099,MAT,18,KJV,then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times
1100,MAT,18,KJV,jesus saith unto him
1101,MAT,18,KJV,i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven
1102,MAT,18,KJV,therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants
1103,MAT,18,KJV,and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents
1104,MAT,18,KJV,but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made
1105,MAT,18,KJV,the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all
1106,MAT,18,KJV,then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt
1107,MAT,18,KJV,but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took
1108,MAT,18,KJV,him
1109,MAT,18,KJV,by the throat saying pay me that thou owest
1110,MAT,18,KJV,and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all
1111,MAT,18,KJV,and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt
1112,MAT,18,KJV,so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done
1113,MAT,18,KJV,then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me
1114,MAT,18,KJV,shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee
1115,MAT,18,KJV,and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him
1116,MAT,18,KJV,so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
1117,MAT,19,KJV,and it came to pass
1118,MAT,19,KJV,that
1119,MAT,19,KJV,when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan
1120,MAT,19,KJV,and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there
1121,MAT,19,KJV,the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause
1122,MAT,19,KJV,and he answered and said unto them
1123,MAT,19,KJV,have ye not read that he which made
1124,MAT,19,KJV,them
1125,MAT,19,KJV,at the beginning made them male and female
1126,MAT,19,KJV,and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh
1127,MAT,19,KJV,wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
1128,MAT,19,KJV,they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away
1129,MAT,19,KJV,he saith unto them
1130,MAT,19,KJV,moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so
1131,MAT,19,KJV,and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except
1132,MAT,19,KJV,it be
1133,MAT,19,KJV,for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
1134,MAT,19,KJV,his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with
1135,MAT,19,KJV,his
1136,MAT,19,KJV,wife it is not good to marry
1137,MAT,19,KJV,but he said unto them
1138,MAT,19,KJV,all
1139,MAT,19,KJV,men
1140,MAT,19,KJV,cannot receive this saying save
1141,MAT,19,KJV,they
1142,MAT,19,KJV,to whom it is given
1143,MAT,19,KJV,for there are some eunuchs which were so born from
1144,MAT,19,KJV,their
1145,MAT,19,KJV,mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive
1146,MAT,19,KJV,it
1147,MAT,19,KJV,let him receive
1148,MAT,19,KJV,it
1149,MAT,19,KJV,then were there brought unto him little children that he should put
1150,MAT,19,KJV,his
1151,MAT,19,KJV,hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them
1152,MAT,19,KJV,but jesus said
1153,MAT,19,KJV,suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven
1154,MAT,19,KJV,and he laid
1155,MAT,19,KJV,his
1156,MAT,19,KJV,hands on them and departed thence
1157,MAT,19,KJV,and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
1158,MAT,19,KJV,and he said unto him
1159,MAT,19,KJV,why callest thou me good
1160,MAT,19,KJV,there is
1161,MAT,19,KJV,none good but one
1162,MAT,19,KJV,that is
1163,MAT,19,KJV,god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments
1164,MAT,19,KJV,he saith unto him which jesus said
1165,MAT,19,KJV,thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness
1166,MAT,19,KJV,honour thy father and
1167,MAT,19,KJV,thy
1168,MAT,19,KJV,mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
1169,MAT,19,KJV,the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet
1170,MAT,19,KJV,jesus said unto him
1171,MAT,19,KJV,if thou wilt be perfect go
1172,MAT,19,KJV,and
1173,MAT,19,KJV,sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come
1174,MAT,19,KJV,and
1175,MAT,19,KJV,follow me
1176,MAT,19,KJV,but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions
1177,MAT,19,KJV,then said jesus unto his disciples
1178,MAT,19,KJV,verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
1179,MAT,19,KJV,and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
1180,MAT,19,KJV,when his disciples heard
1181,MAT,19,KJV,it
1182,MAT,19,KJV,they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved
1183,MAT,19,KJV,but jesus beheld
1184,MAT,19,KJV,them
1185,MAT,19,KJV,and said unto them
1186,MAT,19,KJV,with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
1187,MAT,19,KJV,then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore
1188,MAT,19,KJV,and jesus said unto them
1189,MAT,19,KJV,verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
1190,MAT,19,KJV,and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life
1191,MAT,19,KJV,but many
1192,MAT,19,KJV,that are
1193,MAT,19,KJV,first shall be last and the last
1194,MAT,19,KJV,shall be
1195,MAT,19,KJV,first
1196,MAT,20,KJV,for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
1197,MAT,20,KJV,that is
1198,MAT,20,KJV,an householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard
1199,MAT,20,KJV,and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard
1200,MAT,20,KJV,and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
1201,MAT,20,KJV,and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their way
1202,MAT,20,KJV,again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise
1203,MAT,20,KJV,and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle
1204,MAT,20,KJV,they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right
1205,MAT,20,KJV,that
1206,MAT,20,KJV,shall ye receive
1207,MAT,20,KJV,so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourers and give them
1208,MAT,20,KJV,their
1209,MAT,20,KJV,hire beginning from the last unto the first
1210,MAT,20,KJV,and when they came that
1211,MAT,20,KJV,were hired
1212,MAT,20,KJV,about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny
1213,MAT,20,KJV,but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny
1214,MAT,20,KJV,and when they had received
1215,MAT,20,KJV,it
1216,MAT,20,KJV,they murmured against the goodman of the house
1217,MAT,20,KJV,saying these last have wrought
1218,MAT,20,KJV,but
1219,MAT,20,KJV,one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day
1220,MAT,20,KJV,but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny
1221,MAT,20,KJV,take
1222,MAT,20,KJV,that
1223,MAT,20,KJV,thine
1224,MAT,20,KJV,is
1225,MAT,20,KJV,and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee
1226,MAT,20,KJV,is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is thine eye evil because i am good
1227,MAT,20,KJV,so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen
1228,MAT,20,KJV,and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them
1229,MAT,20,KJV,behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death
1230,MAT,20,KJV,and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify
1231,MAT,20,KJV,him
1232,MAT,20,KJV,and the third day he shall rise again
1233,MAT,20,KJV,then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons worshipping
1234,MAT,20,KJV,him
1235,MAT,20,KJV,and desiring a certain thing of him
1236,MAT,20,KJV,and he said unto her
1237,MAT,20,KJV,what wilt thou
1238,MAT,20,KJV,she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom
1239,MAT,20,KJV,but jesus answered and said
1240,MAT,20,KJV,ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
1241,MAT,20,KJV,they say unto him we are able
1242,MAT,20,KJV,and he saith unto them
1243,MAT,20,KJV,ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but
1244,MAT,20,KJV,it shall be given to them
1245,MAT,20,KJV,for whom it is prepared of my father
1246,MAT,20,KJV,and when the ten heard
1247,MAT,20,KJV,it
1248,MAT,20,KJV,they were moved with indignation against the two brethren
1249,MAT,20,KJV,but jesus called them
1250,MAT,20,KJV,unto him
1251,MAT,20,KJV,and said
1252,MAT,20,KJV,ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them
1253,MAT,20,KJV,but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister
1254,MAT,20,KJV,and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant
1255,MAT,20,KJV,even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
1256,MAT,20,KJV,and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him
1257,MAT,20,KJV,and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord
1258,MAT,20,KJV,thou
1259,MAT,20,KJV,son of david
1260,MAT,20,KJV,and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord
1261,MAT,20,KJV,thou
1262,MAT,20,KJV,son of david
1263,MAT,20,KJV,and jesus stood still and called them and said
1264,MAT,20,KJV,what will ye that i shall do unto you
1265,MAT,20,KJV,they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened
1266,MAT,20,KJV,so jesus had compassion
1267,MAT,20,KJV,on them
1268,MAT,20,KJV,and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him
1269,MAT,21,KJV,and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples
1270,MAT,21,KJV,saying unto them
1271,MAT,21,KJV,go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose
1272,MAT,21,KJV,them
1273,MAT,21,KJV,and bring
1274,MAT,21,KJV,them
1275,MAT,21,KJV,unto me
1276,MAT,21,KJV,and if any
1277,MAT,21,KJV,man
1278,MAT,21,KJV,say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them
1279,MAT,21,KJV,all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying
1280,MAT,21,KJV,tell ye the daughter of sion
1281,MAT,21,KJV,behold thy king cometh unto thee
1282,MAT,21,KJV,meek and sitting upon an ass
1283,MAT,21,KJV,and a colt the foal of an ass
1284,MAT,21,KJV,and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them
1285,MAT,21,KJV,and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set
1286,MAT,21,KJV,him
1287,MAT,21,KJV,thereon
1288,MAT,21,KJV,and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed
1289,MAT,21,KJV,them
1290,MAT,21,KJV,in the way
1291,MAT,21,KJV,and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed
1292,MAT,21,KJV,is
1293,MAT,21,KJV,he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
1294,MAT,21,KJV,and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this
1295,MAT,21,KJV,and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee
1296,MAT,21,KJV,and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
1297,MAT,21,KJV,and said unto them
1298,MAT,21,KJV,it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
1299,MAT,21,KJV,and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them
1300,MAT,21,KJV,and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased
1301,MAT,21,KJV,and said unto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them
1302,MAT,21,KJV,yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise
1303,MAT,21,KJV,and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there
1304,MAT,21,KJV,now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered
1305,MAT,21,KJV,and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it
1306,MAT,21,KJV,let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever
1307,MAT,21,KJV,and presently the fig tree withered away
1308,MAT,21,KJV,and when the disciples saw
1309,MAT,21,KJV,it
1310,MAT,21,KJV,they marvelled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away
1311,MAT,21,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
1312,MAT,21,KJV,verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this
1313,MAT,21,KJV,which is done
1314,MAT,21,KJV,to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done
1315,MAT,21,KJV,and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
1316,MAT,21,KJV,and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority
1317,MAT,21,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them
1318,MAT,21,KJV,i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things
1319,MAT,21,KJV,the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men
1320,MAT,21,KJV,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him
1321,MAT,21,KJV,but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet
1322,MAT,21,KJV,and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them
1323,MAT,21,KJV,neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
1324,MAT,21,KJV,but what think ye a
1325,MAT,21,KJV,certain
1326,MAT,21,KJV,man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard
1327,MAT,21,KJV,he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and went
1328,MAT,21,KJV,and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i
1329,MAT,21,KJV,go
1330,MAT,21,KJV,sir and went not
1331,MAT,21,KJV,whether of them twain did the will of
1332,MAT,21,KJV,his
1333,MAT,21,KJV,father
1334,MAT,21,KJV,they say unto him the first jesus saith unto them
1335,MAT,21,KJV,verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you
1336,MAT,21,KJV,for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen
1337,MAT,21,KJV,it
1338,MAT,21,KJV,repented not afterward that ye might believe him
1339,MAT,21,KJV,hear another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
1340,MAT,21,KJV,and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it
1341,MAT,21,KJV,and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another
1342,MAT,21,KJV,again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise
1343,MAT,21,KJV,but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son
1344,MAT,21,KJV,but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance
1345,MAT,21,KJV,and they caught him and cast
1346,MAT,21,KJV,him
1347,MAT,21,KJV,out of the vineyard and slew
1348,MAT,21,KJV,him
1349,MAT,21,KJV,when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen
1350,MAT,21,KJV,they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out
1351,MAT,21,KJV,his
1352,MAT,21,KJV,vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons
1353,MAT,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them
1354,MAT,21,KJV,did ye never read in the scriptures
1355,MAT,21,KJV,the stone which the builders rejected
1356,MAT,21,KJV,the same is become the head of the corner
1357,MAT,21,KJV,this is the lords doing
1358,MAT,21,KJV,and it is marvellous in our eyes
1359,MAT,21,KJV,therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
1360,MAT,21,KJV,and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
1361,MAT,21,KJV,and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them
1362,MAT,21,KJV,but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet
1363,MAT,22,KJV,and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said
1364,MAT,22,KJV,the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son
1365,MAT,22,KJV,and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come
1366,MAT,22,KJV,again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and
1367,MAT,22,KJV,my
1368,MAT,22,KJV,fatlings
1369,MAT,22,KJV,are
1370,MAT,22,KJV,killed and all things
1371,MAT,22,KJV,are
1372,MAT,22,KJV,ready come unto the marriage
1373,MAT,22,KJV,but they made light of
1374,MAT,22,KJV,it
1375,MAT,22,KJV,and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise
1376,MAT,22,KJV,and the remnant took his servants and entreated
1377,MAT,22,KJV,them
1378,MAT,22,KJV,spitefully and slew
1379,MAT,22,KJV,them
1380,MAT,22,KJV,but when the king heard
1381,MAT,22,KJV,thereof
1382,MAT,22,KJV,he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city
1383,MAT,22,KJV,then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy
1384,MAT,22,KJV,go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage
1385,MAT,22,KJV,so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests
1386,MAT,22,KJV,and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment
1387,MAT,22,KJV,and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless
1388,MAT,22,KJV,then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast
1389,MAT,22,KJV,him
1390,MAT,22,KJV,into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1391,MAT,22,KJV,for many are called but few
1392,MAT,22,KJV,are
1393,MAT,22,KJV,chosen
1394,MAT,22,KJV,then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in
1395,MAT,22,KJV,his
1396,MAT,22,KJV,talk
1397,MAT,22,KJV,and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any
1398,MAT,22,KJV,man
1399,MAT,22,KJV,for thou regardest not the person of men
1400,MAT,22,KJV,tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not
1401,MAT,22,KJV,but jesus perceived their wickedness and said
1402,MAT,22,KJV,why tempt ye me
1403,MAT,22,KJV,ye
1404,MAT,22,KJV,hypocrites
1405,MAT,22,KJV,shew me the tribute money
1406,MAT,22,KJV,and they brought unto him a penny
1407,MAT,22,KJV,and he saith unto them
1408,MAT,22,KJV,whose
1409,MAT,22,KJV,is
1410,MAT,22,KJV,this image and superscription
1411,MAT,22,KJV,they say unto him caesars then saith he unto them
1412,MAT,22,KJV,render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods
1413,MAT,22,KJV,when they had heard
1414,MAT,22,KJV,these words
1415,MAT,22,KJV,they marvelled and left him and went their way
1416,MAT,22,KJV,the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked him
1417,MAT,22,KJV,saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
1418,MAT,22,KJV,now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother
1419,MAT,22,KJV,likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh
1420,MAT,22,KJV,and last of all the woman died also
1421,MAT,22,KJV,therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her
1422,MAT,22,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
1423,MAT,22,KJV,ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god
1424,MAT,22,KJV,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven
1425,MAT,22,KJV,but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying
1426,MAT,22,KJV,i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living
1427,MAT,22,KJV,and when the multitude heard
1428,MAT,22,KJV,this
1429,MAT,22,KJV,they were astonished at his doctrine
1430,MAT,22,KJV,but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together
1431,MAT,22,KJV,then one of them
1432,MAT,22,KJV,which was
1433,MAT,22,KJV,a lawyer asked
1434,MAT,22,KJV,him a question
1435,MAT,22,KJV,tempting him and saying
1436,MAT,22,KJV,master which
1437,MAT,22,KJV,is
1438,MAT,22,KJV,the great commandment in the law
1439,MAT,22,KJV,jesus said unto him
1440,MAT,22,KJV,thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
1441,MAT,22,KJV,this is the first and great commandment
1442,MAT,22,KJV,and the second
1443,MAT,22,KJV,is
1444,MAT,22,KJV,like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
1445,MAT,22,KJV,on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
1446,MAT,22,KJV,while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them
1447,MAT,22,KJV,saying
1448,MAT,22,KJV,what think ye of christ whose son is he
1449,MAT,22,KJV,they say unto him
1450,MAT,22,KJV,the son
1451,MAT,22,KJV,of david
1452,MAT,22,KJV,he saith unto them
1453,MAT,22,KJV,how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying
1454,MAT,22,KJV,the
1455,MAT,22,KJV,lord
1456,MAT,22,KJV,said unto my lord
1457,MAT,22,KJV,sit thou on my right hand
1458,MAT,22,KJV,till i make thine enemies thy footstool
1459,MAT,22,KJV,if david then call him lord how is he his son
1460,MAT,22,KJV,and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any
1461,MAT,22,KJV,man
1462,MAT,22,KJV,from that day forth ask him any more
1463,MAT,22,KJV,questions
1464,MAT,23,KJV,then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples
1465,MAT,23,KJV,saying
1466,MAT,23,KJV,the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat
1467,MAT,23,KJV,all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe
1468,MAT,23,KJV,that
1469,MAT,23,KJV,observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not
1470,MAT,23,KJV,for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay
1471,MAT,23,KJV,them
1472,MAT,23,KJV,on mens shoulders but they
1473,MAT,23,KJV,themselves
1474,MAT,23,KJV,will not move them with one of their fingers
1475,MAT,23,KJV,but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments
1476,MAT,23,KJV,and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
1477,MAT,23,KJV,and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi
1478,MAT,23,KJV,but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master
1479,MAT,23,KJV,even
1480,MAT,23,KJV,christ and all ye are brethren
1481,MAT,23,KJV,and call no
1482,MAT,23,KJV,man
1483,MAT,23,KJV,your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
1484,MAT,23,KJV,neither be ye called masters for one is your master
1485,MAT,23,KJV,even
1486,MAT,23,KJV,christ
1487,MAT,23,KJV,but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
1488,MAT,23,KJV,and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted
1489,MAT,23,KJV,but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in
1490,MAT,23,KJV,yourselves
1491,MAT,23,KJV,neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
1492,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation
1493,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
1494,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you
1495,MAT,23,KJV,ye
1496,MAT,23,KJV,blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor
1497,MAT,23,KJV,ye
1498,MAT,23,KJV,fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold
1499,MAT,23,KJV,and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty
1500,MAT,23,KJV,ye
1501,MAT,23,KJV,fools and blind for whether
1502,MAT,23,KJV,is
1503,MAT,23,KJV,greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift
1504,MAT,23,KJV,whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon
1505,MAT,23,KJV,and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein
1506,MAT,23,KJV,and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon
1507,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier
1508,MAT,23,KJV,matters
1509,MAT,23,KJV,of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
1510,MAT,23,KJV,ye
1511,MAT,23,KJV,blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
1512,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess
1513,MAT,23,KJV,thou
1514,MAT,23,KJV,blind pharisee cleanse first that
1515,MAT,23,KJV,which is
1516,MAT,23,KJV,within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also
1517,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead
1518,MAT,23,KJV,mens
1519,MAT,23,KJV,bones and of all uncleanness
1520,MAT,23,KJV,even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
1521,MAT,23,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
1522,MAT,23,KJV,and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets
1523,MAT,23,KJV,wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
1524,MAT,23,KJV,fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
1525,MAT,23,KJV,ye
1526,MAT,23,KJV,serpents
1527,MAT,23,KJV,ye
1528,MAT,23,KJV,generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
1529,MAT,23,KJV,wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and
1530,MAT,23,KJV,some
1531,MAT,23,KJV,of them ye shall kill and crucify and
1532,MAT,23,KJV,some
1533,MAT,23,KJV,of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute
1534,MAT,23,KJV,them
1535,MAT,23,KJV,from city to city
1536,MAT,23,KJV,that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar
1537,MAT,23,KJV,verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation
1538,MAT,23,KJV,o jerusalem jerusalem
1539,MAT,23,KJV,thou
1540,MAT,23,KJV,that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
1541,MAT,23,KJV,her
1542,MAT,23,KJV,wings and ye would not
1543,MAT,23,KJV,behold your house is left unto you desolate
1544,MAT,23,KJV,for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed
1545,MAT,23,KJV,is
1546,MAT,23,KJV,he that cometh in the name of the lord
1547,MAT,24,KJV,and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to
1548,MAT,24,KJV,him
1549,MAT,24,KJV,for to shew him the buildings of the temple
1550,MAT,24,KJV,and jesus said unto them
1551,MAT,24,KJV,see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
1552,MAT,24,KJV,and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what
1553,MAT,24,KJV,shall be
1554,MAT,24,KJV,the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world
1555,MAT,24,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them
1556,MAT,24,KJV,take heed that no man deceive you
1557,MAT,24,KJV,for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
1558,MAT,24,KJV,and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all
1559,MAT,24,KJV,these things
1560,MAT,24,KJV,must come to pass but the end is not yet
1561,MAT,24,KJV,for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places
1562,MAT,24,KJV,all these
1563,MAT,24,KJV,are
1564,MAT,24,KJV,the beginning of sorrows
1565,MAT,24,KJV,then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake
1566,MAT,24,KJV,and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
1567,MAT,24,KJV,and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many
1568,MAT,24,KJV,and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold
1569,MAT,24,KJV,but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
1570,MAT,24,KJV,and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come
1571,MAT,24,KJV,when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand
1572,MAT,24,KJV,then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains
1573,MAT,24,KJV,let him which is on the house top not come down to take any thing out of his house
1574,MAT,24,KJV,neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes
1575,MAT,24,KJV,and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
1576,MAT,24,KJV,but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day
1577,MAT,24,KJV,for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be
1578,MAT,24,KJV,and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened
1579,MAT,24,KJV,then if any man shall say unto you lo here
1580,MAT,24,KJV,is
1581,MAT,24,KJV,christ or there believe
1582,MAT,24,KJV,it
1583,MAT,24,KJV,not
1584,MAT,24,KJV,for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if
1585,MAT,24,KJV,it were
1586,MAT,24,KJV,possible they shall deceive the very elect
1587,MAT,24,KJV,behold i have told you before
1588,MAT,24,KJV,wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold
1589,MAT,24,KJV,he is
1590,MAT,24,KJV,in the secret chambers believe
1591,MAT,24,KJV,it
1592,MAT,24,KJV,not
1593,MAT,24,KJV,for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be
1594,MAT,24,KJV,for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together
1595,MAT,24,KJV,immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
1596,MAT,24,KJV,and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
1597,MAT,24,KJV,and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
1598,MAT,24,KJV,now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer
1599,MAT,24,KJV,is
1600,MAT,24,KJV,nigh
1601,MAT,24,KJV,so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near
1602,MAT,24,KJV,even
1603,MAT,24,KJV,at the doors
1604,MAT,24,KJV,verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled
1605,MAT,24,KJV,heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
1606,MAT,24,KJV,but of that day and hour knoweth no
1607,MAT,24,KJV,man
1608,MAT,24,KJV,no not the angels of heaven but my father only
1609,MAT,24,KJV,but as the days of noe
1610,MAT,24,KJV,were
1611,MAT,24,KJV,so shall also the coming of the son of man be
1612,MAT,24,KJV,for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark
1613,MAT,24,KJV,and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be
1614,MAT,24,KJV,then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left
1615,MAT,24,KJV,two
1616,MAT,24,KJV,women shall be
1617,MAT,24,KJV,grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left
1618,MAT,24,KJV,watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come
1619,MAT,24,KJV,but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up
1620,MAT,24,KJV,therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh
1621,MAT,24,KJV,who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season
1622,MAT,24,KJV,blessed
1623,MAT,24,KJV,is
1624,MAT,24,KJV,that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
1625,MAT,24,KJV,verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods
1626,MAT,24,KJV,but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming
1627,MAT,24,KJV,and shall begin to smite
1628,MAT,24,KJV,his
1629,MAT,24,KJV,fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken
1630,MAT,24,KJV,the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for
1631,MAT,24,KJV,him
1632,MAT,24,KJV,and in an hour that he is not aware of
1633,MAT,24,KJV,and shall cut him asunder and appoint
1634,MAT,24,KJV,him
1635,MAT,24,KJV,his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1636,MAT,25,KJV,then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
1637,MAT,25,KJV,and five of them were wise and five
1638,MAT,25,KJV,were
1639,MAT,25,KJV,foolish
1640,MAT,25,KJV,they that
1641,MAT,25,KJV,were
1642,MAT,25,KJV,foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them
1643,MAT,25,KJV,but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
1644,MAT,25,KJV,while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept
1645,MAT,25,KJV,and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
1646,MAT,25,KJV,then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
1647,MAT,25,KJV,and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out
1648,MAT,25,KJV,but the wise answered saying
1649,MAT,25,KJV,not so
1650,MAT,25,KJV,lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves
1651,MAT,25,KJV,and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut
1652,MAT,25,KJV,afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us
1653,MAT,25,KJV,but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not
1654,MAT,25,KJV,watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh
1655,MAT,25,KJV,for
1656,MAT,25,KJV,the kingdom of heaven is
1657,MAT,25,KJV,as a man travelling into a far country
1658,MAT,25,KJV,who
1659,MAT,25,KJV,called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods
1660,MAT,25,KJV,and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey
1661,MAT,25,KJV,then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made
1662,MAT,25,KJV,them
1663,MAT,25,KJV,other five talents
1664,MAT,25,KJV,and likewise he that
1665,MAT,25,KJV,had received
1666,MAT,25,KJV,two he also gained other two
1667,MAT,25,KJV,but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lords money
1668,MAT,25,KJV,after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them
1669,MAT,25,KJV,and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more
1670,MAT,25,KJV,his lord said unto him well done
1671,MAT,25,KJV,thou
1672,MAT,25,KJV,good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
1673,MAT,25,KJV,he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them
1674,MAT,25,KJV,his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
1675,MAT,25,KJV,then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed
1676,MAT,25,KJV,and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo
1677,MAT,25,KJV,there
1678,MAT,25,KJV,thou hast
1679,MAT,25,KJV,that is
1680,MAT,25,KJV,thine
1681,MAT,25,KJV,his lord answered and said unto him
1682,MAT,25,KJV,thou
1683,MAT,25,KJV,wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed
1684,MAT,25,KJV,thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and
1685,MAT,25,KJV,then
1686,MAT,25,KJV,at my coming i should have received mine own with usury
1687,MAT,25,KJV,take therefore the talent from him and give
1688,MAT,25,KJV,it
1689,MAT,25,KJV,unto him which hath ten talents
1690,MAT,25,KJV,for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
1691,MAT,25,KJV,and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1692,MAT,25,KJV,when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
1693,MAT,25,KJV,and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth
1694,MAT,25,KJV,his
1695,MAT,25,KJV,sheep from the goats
1696,MAT,25,KJV,and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left
1697,MAT,25,KJV,then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
1698,MAT,25,KJV,for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in
1699,MAT,25,KJV,naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
1700,MAT,25,KJV,then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed
1701,MAT,25,KJV,thee
1702,MAT,25,KJV,or thirsty and gave
1703,MAT,25,KJV,thee
1704,MAT,25,KJV,drink
1705,MAT,25,KJV,when saw we thee a stranger and took
1706,MAT,25,KJV,thee
1707,MAT,25,KJV,in or naked and clothed
1708,MAT,25,KJV,thee
1709,MAT,25,KJV,or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee
1710,MAT,25,KJV,and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done
1711,MAT,25,KJV,it
1712,MAT,25,KJV,unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done
1713,MAT,25,KJV,it
1714,MAT,25,KJV,unto me
1715,MAT,25,KJV,then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
1716,MAT,25,KJV,for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink
1717,MAT,25,KJV,i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not
1718,MAT,25,KJV,then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee
1719,MAT,25,KJV,then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did
1720,MAT,25,KJV,it
1721,MAT,25,KJV,not to one of the least of these ye did
1722,MAT,25,KJV,it
1723,MAT,25,KJV,not to me
1724,MAT,25,KJV,and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
1725,MAT,26,KJV,and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples
1726,MAT,26,KJV,ye know that after two days is
1727,MAT,26,KJV,the feast of
1728,MAT,26,KJV,the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
1729,MAT,26,KJV,then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas
1730,MAT,26,KJV,and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty and kill
1731,MAT,26,KJV,him
1732,MAT,26,KJV,
1733,MAT,26,KJV,but they said not on the feast
1734,MAT,26,KJV,day
1735,MAT,26,KJV,lest there be an uproar among the people
1736,MAT,26,KJV,now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
1737,MAT,26,KJV,there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat
1738,MAT,26,KJV,but when his disciples saw
1739,MAT,26,KJV,it
1740,MAT,26,KJV,they had indignation saying to what purpose
1741,MAT,26,KJV,is
1742,MAT,26,KJV,this waste
1743,MAT,26,KJV,for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor
1744,MAT,26,KJV,when jesus understood
1745,MAT,26,KJV,it
1746,MAT,26,KJV,he said unto them
1747,MAT,26,KJV,why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me
1748,MAT,26,KJV,for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always
1749,MAT,26,KJV,for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did
1750,MAT,26,KJV,it
1751,MAT,26,KJV,for my burial
1752,MAT,26,KJV,verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world
1753,MAT,26,KJV,there
1754,MAT,26,KJV,shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her
1755,MAT,26,KJV,then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests
1756,MAT,26,KJV,and said
1757,MAT,26,KJV,unto them
1758,MAT,26,KJV,what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
1759,MAT,26,KJV,and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
1760,MAT,26,KJV,now the first
1761,MAT,26,KJV,day
1762,MAT,26,KJV,of the
1763,MAT,26,KJV,feast of
1764,MAT,26,KJV,unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover
1765,MAT,26,KJV,and he said
1766,MAT,26,KJV,go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples
1767,MAT,26,KJV,and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover
1768,MAT,26,KJV,now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve
1769,MAT,26,KJV,and as they did eat he said
1770,MAT,26,KJV,verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me
1771,MAT,26,KJV,and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i
1772,MAT,26,KJV,and he answered and said
1773,MAT,26,KJV,he that dippeth
1774,MAT,26,KJV,his
1775,MAT,26,KJV,hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me
1776,MAT,26,KJV,the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born
1777,MAT,26,KJV,then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him
1778,MAT,26,KJV,thou hast said
1779,MAT,26,KJV,and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed
1780,MAT,26,KJV,it
1781,MAT,26,KJV,and brake
1782,MAT,26,KJV,it
1783,MAT,26,KJV,and gave
1784,MAT,26,KJV,it
1785,MAT,26,KJV,to the disciples and said
1786,MAT,26,KJV,take eat this is my body
1787,MAT,26,KJV,and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave
1788,MAT,26,KJV,it
1789,MAT,26,KJV,to them saying
1790,MAT,26,KJV,drink ye all of it
1791,MAT,26,KJV,for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
1792,MAT,26,KJV,but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom
1793,MAT,26,KJV,and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
1794,MAT,26,KJV,then saith jesus unto them
1795,MAT,26,KJV,all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad
1796,MAT,26,KJV,but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee
1797,MAT,26,KJV,peter answered and said unto him though all
1798,MAT,26,KJV,men
1799,MAT,26,KJV,shall be offended because of thee
1800,MAT,26,KJV,yet
1801,MAT,26,KJV,will i never be offended
1802,MAT,26,KJV,jesus said unto him
1803,MAT,26,KJV,verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
1804,MAT,26,KJV,peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples
1805,MAT,26,KJV,then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples
1806,MAT,26,KJV,sit ye here while i go and pray yonder
1807,MAT,26,KJV,and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
1808,MAT,26,KJV,then saith he unto them
1809,MAT,26,KJV,my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me
1810,MAT,26,KJV,and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying
1811,MAT,26,KJV,o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou
1812,MAT,26,KJV,wilt
1813,MAT,26,KJV,and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter
1814,MAT,26,KJV,what could ye not watch with me one hour
1815,MAT,26,KJV,watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed
1816,MAT,26,KJV,is
1817,MAT,26,KJV,willing but the flesh
1818,MAT,26,KJV,is
1819,MAT,26,KJV,weak
1820,MAT,26,KJV,he went away again the second time and prayed saying
1821,MAT,26,KJV,o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done
1822,MAT,26,KJV,and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy
1823,MAT,26,KJV,and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words
1824,MAT,26,KJV,then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them
1825,MAT,26,KJV,sleep on now and take
1826,MAT,26,KJV,your
1827,MAT,26,KJV,rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
1828,MAT,26,KJV,rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me
1829,MAT,26,KJV,and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people
1830,MAT,26,KJV,now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast
1831,MAT,26,KJV,and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him
1832,MAT,26,KJV,and jesus said unto him
1833,MAT,26,KJV,friend wherefore art thou come
1834,MAT,26,KJV,then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him
1835,MAT,26,KJV,and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out
1836,MAT,26,KJV,his
1837,MAT,26,KJV,hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear
1838,MAT,26,KJV,then said jesus unto him
1839,MAT,26,KJV,put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
1840,MAT,26,KJV,thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels
1841,MAT,26,KJV,but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be
1842,MAT,26,KJV,in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes
1843,MAT,26,KJV,are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me
1844,MAT,26,KJV,but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled
1845,MAT,26,KJV,then all the disciples forsook him and fled
1846,MAT,26,KJV,and they that had laid hold on jesus led
1847,MAT,26,KJV,him
1848,MAT,26,KJV,away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled
1849,MAT,26,KJV,but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end
1850,MAT,26,KJV,now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death
1851,MAT,26,KJV,but found none yea though many false witnesses came
1852,MAT,26,KJV,yet
1853,MAT,26,KJV,found they none at the last came two false witnesses
1854,MAT,26,KJV,and said this
1855,MAT,26,KJV,fellow
1856,MAT,26,KJV,said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
1857,MAT,26,KJV,and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what
1858,MAT,26,KJV,is it which
1859,MAT,26,KJV,these witness against thee
1860,MAT,26,KJV,but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god
1861,MAT,26,KJV,jesus saith unto him
1862,MAT,26,KJV,thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
1863,MAT,26,KJV,then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy
1864,MAT,26,KJV,what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death
1865,MAT,26,KJV,then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote
1866,MAT,26,KJV,him
1867,MAT,26,KJV,with the palms of their hands
1868,MAT,26,KJV,saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee
1869,MAT,26,KJV,now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee
1870,MAT,26,KJV,but he denied before
1871,MAT,26,KJV,them
1872,MAT,26,KJV,all saying i know not what thou sayest
1873,MAT,26,KJV,and when he was gone out into the porch another
1874,MAT,26,KJV,maid
1875,MAT,26,KJV,saw him and said unto them that were there this
1876,MAT,26,KJV,fellow
1877,MAT,26,KJV,was also with jesus of nazareth
1878,MAT,26,KJV,and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man
1879,MAT,26,KJV,and after a while came unto
1880,MAT,26,KJV,him
1881,MAT,26,KJV,they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art
1882,MAT,26,KJV,one
1883,MAT,26,KJV,of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee
1884,MAT,26,KJV,then began he to curse and to swear
1885,MAT,26,KJV,saying
1886,MAT,26,KJV,i know not the man and immediately the cock crew
1887,MAT,26,KJV,and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
1888,MAT,27,KJV,when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death
1889,MAT,27,KJV,and when they had bound him they led
1890,MAT,27,KJV,him
1891,MAT,27,KJV,away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
1892,MAT,27,KJV,then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders
1893,MAT,27,KJV,saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what
1894,MAT,27,KJV,is that
1895,MAT,27,KJV,to us see thou
1896,MAT,27,KJV,to that
1897,MAT,27,KJV,
1898,MAT,27,KJV,and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself
1899,MAT,27,KJV,and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood
1900,MAT,27,KJV,and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in
1901,MAT,27,KJV,wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day
1902,MAT,27,KJV,then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value
1903,MAT,27,KJV,and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me
1904,MAT,27,KJV,and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him
1905,MAT,27,KJV,thou sayest
1906,MAT,27,KJV,and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing
1907,MAT,27,KJV,then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee
1908,MAT,27,KJV,and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
1909,MAT,27,KJV,now at
1910,MAT,27,KJV,that
1911,MAT,27,KJV,feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would
1912,MAT,27,KJV,and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas
1913,MAT,27,KJV,therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ
1914,MAT,27,KJV,for he knew that for envy they had delivered him
1915,MAT,27,KJV,when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him
1916,MAT,27,KJV,but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus
1917,MAT,27,KJV,the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas
1918,MAT,27,KJV,pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ
1919,MAT,27,KJV,they
1920,MAT,27,KJV,all say unto him let him be crucified
1921,MAT,27,KJV,and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified
1922,MAT,27,KJV,when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but
1923,MAT,27,KJV,that
1924,MAT,27,KJV,rather a tumult was made he took water and washed
1925,MAT,27,KJV,his
1926,MAT,27,KJV,hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye
1927,MAT,27,KJV,to it
1928,MAT,27,KJV,
1929,MAT,27,KJV,then answered all the people and said his blood
1930,MAT,27,KJV,be
1931,MAT,27,KJV,on us and on our children
1932,MAT,27,KJV,then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered
1933,MAT,27,KJV,him
1934,MAT,27,KJV,to be crucified
1935,MAT,27,KJV,then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band
1936,MAT,27,KJV,of soldiers
1937,MAT,27,KJV,
1938,MAT,27,KJV,and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe
1939,MAT,27,KJV,and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put
1940,MAT,27,KJV,it
1941,MAT,27,KJV,upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews
1942,MAT,27,KJV,and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head
1943,MAT,27,KJV,and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify
1944,MAT,27,KJV,him
1945,MAT,27,KJV,
1946,MAT,27,KJV,and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross
1947,MAT,27,KJV,and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull
1948,MAT,27,KJV,they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted
1949,MAT,27,KJV,thereof
1950,MAT,27,KJV,he would not drink
1951,MAT,27,KJV,and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots
1952,MAT,27,KJV,and sitting down they watched him there
1953,MAT,27,KJV,and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews
1954,MAT,27,KJV,then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left
1955,MAT,27,KJV,and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads
1956,MAT,27,KJV,and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest
1957,MAT,27,KJV,it
1958,MAT,27,KJV,in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross
1959,MAT,27,KJV,likewise also the chief priests mocking
1960,MAT,27,KJV,him
1961,MAT,27,KJV,with the scribes and elders said
1962,MAT,27,KJV,he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him
1963,MAT,27,KJV,he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god
1964,MAT,27,KJV,the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth
1965,MAT,27,KJV,now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour
1966,MAT,27,KJV,and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying
1967,MAT,27,KJV,eli eli lama sabachthani
1968,MAT,27,KJV,that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
1969,MAT,27,KJV,some of them that stood there when they heard
1970,MAT,27,KJV,that
1971,MAT,27,KJV,said this
1972,MAT,27,KJV,man
1973,MAT,27,KJV,calleth for elias
1974,MAT,27,KJV,and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled
1975,MAT,27,KJV,it
1976,MAT,27,KJV,with vinegar and put
1977,MAT,27,KJV,it
1978,MAT,27,KJV,on a reed and gave him to drink
1979,MAT,27,KJV,the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him
1980,MAT,27,KJV,jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost
1981,MAT,27,KJV,and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent
1982,MAT,27,KJV,and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose
1983,MAT,27,KJV,and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many
1984,MAT,27,KJV,now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god
1985,MAT,27,KJV,and many women were there beholding afar off which followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him
1986,MAT,27,KJV,among which was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees children
1987,MAT,27,KJV,when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple
1988,MAT,27,KJV,he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered
1989,MAT,27,KJV,and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
1990,MAT,27,KJV,and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed
1991,MAT,27,KJV,and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre
1992,MAT,27,KJV,now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate
1993,MAT,27,KJV,saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again
1994,MAT,27,KJV,command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first
1995,MAT,27,KJV,pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make
1996,MAT,27,KJV,it
1997,MAT,27,KJV,as sure as ye can
1998,MAT,27,KJV,so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch
1999,MAT,28,KJV,in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first
2000,MAT,28,KJV,day
2001,MAT,28,KJV,of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre
2002,MAT,28,KJV,and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it
2003,MAT,28,KJV,his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow
2004,MAT,28,KJV,and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead
2005,MAT,28,KJV,men
2006,MAT,28,KJV,
2007,MAT,28,KJV,and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified
2008,MAT,28,KJV,he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay
2009,MAT,28,KJV,and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you
2010,MAT,28,KJV,and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word
2011,MAT,28,KJV,and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying
2012,MAT,28,KJV,all hail
2013,MAT,28,KJV,and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him
2014,MAT,28,KJV,then said jesus unto them
2015,MAT,28,KJV,be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
2016,MAT,28,KJV,now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done
2017,MAT,28,KJV,and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers
2018,MAT,28,KJV,saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him
2019,MAT,28,KJV,away
2020,MAT,28,KJV,while we slept
2021,MAT,28,KJV,and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure you
2022,MAT,28,KJV,so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day
2023,MAT,28,KJV,then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them
2024,MAT,28,KJV,and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
2025,MAT,28,KJV,and jesus came and spake unto them saying
2026,MAT,28,KJV,all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
2027,MAT,28,KJV,go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
2028,MAT,28,KJV,teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway
2029,MAT,28,KJV,even
2030,MAT,28,KJV,unto the end of the world
2031,MAT,28,KJV,amen
2032,MRK,1,KJV,the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
2033,MRK,1,KJV,as it is written in the prophets
2034,MRK,1,KJV,behold i send my messenger before thy face
2035,MRK,1,KJV,which shall prepare thy way before thee
2036,MRK,1,KJV,the voice of one crying in the wilderness
2037,MRK,1,KJV,prepare ye the way of the lord
2038,MRK,1,KJV,make his paths straight
2039,MRK,1,KJV,john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
2040,MRK,1,KJV,and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
2041,MRK,1,KJV,and john was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey
2042,MRK,1,KJV,and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
2043,MRK,1,KJV,i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
2044,MRK,1,KJV,and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan
2045,MRK,1,KJV,and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him
2046,MRK,1,KJV,and there came a voice from heaven
2047,MRK,1,KJV,saying
2048,MRK,1,KJV,thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
2049,MRK,1,KJV,and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness
2050,MRK,1,KJV,and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him
2051,MRK,1,KJV,now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god
2052,MRK,1,KJV,and saying
2053,MRK,1,KJV,the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
2054,MRK,1,KJV,now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
2055,MRK,1,KJV,and jesus said unto them
2056,MRK,1,KJV,come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men
2057,MRK,1,KJV,and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him
2058,MRK,1,KJV,and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james the
2059,MRK,1,KJV,son
2060,MRK,1,KJV,of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the ship mending their nets
2061,MRK,1,KJV,and straightway he called them and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him
2062,MRK,1,KJV,and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught
2063,MRK,1,KJV,and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes
2064,MRK,1,KJV,and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out
2065,MRK,1,KJV,saying let
2066,MRK,1,KJV,us
2067,MRK,1,KJV,alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
2068,MRK,1,KJV,and jesus rebuked him saying
2069,MRK,1,KJV,hold thy peace and come out of him
2070,MRK,1,KJV,and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him
2071,MRK,1,KJV,and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine
2072,MRK,1,KJV,is
2073,MRK,1,KJV,this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him
2074,MRK,1,KJV,and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee
2075,MRK,1,KJV,and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john
2076,MRK,1,KJV,but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell him of her
2077,MRK,1,KJV,and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them
2078,MRK,1,KJV,and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils
2079,MRK,1,KJV,and all the city was gathered together at the door
2080,MRK,1,KJV,and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him
2081,MRK,1,KJV,and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed
2082,MRK,1,KJV,and simon and they that were with him followed after him
2083,MRK,1,KJV,and when they had found him they said unto him all
2084,MRK,1,KJV,men
2085,MRK,1,KJV,seek for thee
2086,MRK,1,KJV,and he said unto them
2087,MRK,1,KJV,let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth
2088,MRK,1,KJV,and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee and cast out devils
2089,MRK,1,KJV,and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
2090,MRK,1,KJV,and jesus moved with compassion put forth
2091,MRK,1,KJV,his
2092,MRK,1,KJV,hand and touched him and saith unto him
2093,MRK,1,KJV,i will be thou clean
2094,MRK,1,KJV,and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed
2095,MRK,1,KJV,and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away
2096,MRK,1,KJV,and saith unto him
2097,MRK,1,KJV,see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them
2098,MRK,1,KJV,but he went out and began to publish
2099,MRK,1,KJV,it
2100,MRK,1,KJV,much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter
2101,MRK,2,KJV,and again he entered into capernaum after
2102,MRK,2,KJV,some
2103,MRK,2,KJV,days and it was noised that he was in the house
2104,MRK,2,KJV,and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there was no room to receive
2105,MRK,2,KJV,them
2106,MRK,2,KJV,no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them
2107,MRK,2,KJV,and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was borne of four
2108,MRK,2,KJV,and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken
2109,MRK,2,KJV,it
2110,MRK,2,KJV,up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay
2111,MRK,2,KJV,when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy
2112,MRK,2,KJV,son thy sins be forgiven thee
2113,MRK,2,KJV,but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts
2114,MRK,2,KJV,why doth this
2115,MRK,2,KJV,man
2116,MRK,2,KJV,thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only
2117,MRK,2,KJV,and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them
2118,MRK,2,KJV,why reason ye these things in your hearts
2119,MRK,2,KJV,whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy
2120,MRK,2,KJV,thy
2121,MRK,2,KJV,sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk
2122,MRK,2,KJV,but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins
2123,MRK,2,KJV,he saith to the sick of the palsy
2124,MRK,2,KJV,i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house
2125,MRK,2,KJV,and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion
2126,MRK,2,KJV,and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them
2127,MRK,2,KJV,and as he passed by he saw levi the
2128,MRK,2,KJV,son
2129,MRK,2,KJV,of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
2130,MRK,2,KJV,and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him
2131,MRK,2,KJV,and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners
2132,MRK,2,KJV,when jesus heard
2133,MRK,2,KJV,it
2134,MRK,2,KJV,he saith unto them
2135,MRK,2,KJV,they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
2136,MRK,2,KJV,and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not
2137,MRK,2,KJV,and jesus said unto them
2138,MRK,2,KJV,can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
2139,MRK,2,KJV,but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days
2140,MRK,2,KJV,no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse
2141,MRK,2,KJV,and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles
2142,MRK,2,KJV,and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn
2143,MRK,2,KJV,and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful
2144,MRK,2,KJV,and he said unto them
2145,MRK,2,KJV,have ye never read what david did when he had need and was an hungred he and they that were with him
2146,MRK,2,KJV,how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to them which were with him
2147,MRK,2,KJV,and he said unto them
2148,MRK,2,KJV,the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
2149,MRK,2,KJV,therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
2150,MRK,3,KJV,and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand
2151,MRK,3,KJV,and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him
2152,MRK,3,KJV,and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand
2153,MRK,3,KJV,stand forth
2154,MRK,3,KJV,and he saith unto them
2155,MRK,3,KJV,is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill
2156,MRK,3,KJV,but they held their peace
2157,MRK,3,KJV,and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man
2158,MRK,3,KJV,stretch forth thine hand
2159,MRK,3,KJV,and he stretched
2160,MRK,3,KJV,it
2161,MRK,3,KJV,out and his hand was restored whole as the other
2162,MRK,3,KJV,and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him
2163,MRK,3,KJV,but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him and from judaea
2164,MRK,3,KJV,and from jerusalem and from idumaea and
2165,MRK,3,KJV,from
2166,MRK,3,KJV,beyond jordan and they about tyre and sidon a great multitude when they had heard what great things he did came unto him
2167,MRK,3,KJV,and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude lest they should throng him
2168,MRK,3,KJV,for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him as many as had plagues
2169,MRK,3,KJV,and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god
2170,MRK,3,KJV,and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known
2171,MRK,3,KJV,and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth
2172,MRK,3,KJV,unto him
2173,MRK,3,KJV,whom he would and they came unto him
2174,MRK,3,KJV,and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach
2175,MRK,3,KJV,and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils
2176,MRK,3,KJV,and simon he surnamed peter
2177,MRK,3,KJV,and james the
2178,MRK,3,KJV,son
2179,MRK,3,KJV,of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder
2180,MRK,3,KJV,and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the
2181,MRK,3,KJV,son
2182,MRK,3,KJV,of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite
2183,MRK,3,KJV,and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house
2184,MRK,3,KJV,and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread
2185,MRK,3,KJV,and when his friends heard
2186,MRK,3,KJV,of it
2187,MRK,3,KJV,they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself
2188,MRK,3,KJV,and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils
2189,MRK,3,KJV,and he called them
2190,MRK,3,KJV,unto him
2191,MRK,3,KJV,and said unto them in parables
2192,MRK,3,KJV,how can satan cast out satan
2193,MRK,3,KJV,and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
2194,MRK,3,KJV,and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand
2195,MRK,3,KJV,and if satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an end
2196,MRK,3,KJV,no man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
2197,MRK,3,KJV,verily i say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
2198,MRK,3,KJV,but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation
2199,MRK,3,KJV,because they said he hath an unclean spirit
2200,MRK,3,KJV,there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him
2201,MRK,3,KJV,and the multitude sat about him and they said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee
2202,MRK,3,KJV,and he answered them saying
2203,MRK,3,KJV,who is my mother or my brethren
2204,MRK,3,KJV,and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said
2205,MRK,3,KJV,behold my mother and my brethren
2206,MRK,3,KJV,for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother
2207,MRK,4,KJV,and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land
2208,MRK,4,KJV,and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine
2209,MRK,4,KJV,hearken behold there went out a sower to sow
2210,MRK,4,KJV,and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up
2211,MRK,4,KJV,and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth
2212,MRK,4,KJV,but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away
2213,MRK,4,KJV,and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit
2214,MRK,4,KJV,and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred
2215,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
2216,MRK,4,KJV,he that hath ears to hear let him hear
2217,MRK,4,KJV,and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable
2218,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
2219,MRK,4,KJV,unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all
2220,MRK,4,KJV,these
2221,MRK,4,KJV,things are done in parables
2222,MRK,4,KJV,that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and
2223,MRK,4,KJV,their
2224,MRK,4,KJV,sins should be forgiven them
2225,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
2226,MRK,4,KJV,know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parables
2227,MRK,4,KJV,the sower soweth the word
2228,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts
2229,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness
2230,MRK,4,KJV,and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended
2231,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word
2232,MRK,4,KJV,and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful
2233,MRK,4,KJV,and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive
2234,MRK,4,KJV,it
2235,MRK,4,KJV,and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred
2236,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
2237,MRK,4,KJV,is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick
2238,MRK,4,KJV,for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad
2239,MRK,4,KJV,if any man have ears to hear let him hear
2240,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
2241,MRK,4,KJV,take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be given
2242,MRK,4,KJV,for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath
2243,MRK,4,KJV,and he said
2244,MRK,4,KJV,so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground
2245,MRK,4,KJV,and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how
2246,MRK,4,KJV,for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear
2247,MRK,4,KJV,but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come
2248,MRK,4,KJV,and he said
2249,MRK,4,KJV,whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compare it
2250,MRK,4,KJV,it is
2251,MRK,4,KJV,like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
2252,MRK,4,KJV,but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it
2253,MRK,4,KJV,and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear
2254,MRK,4,KJV,it
2255,MRK,4,KJV,
2256,MRK,4,KJV,but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples
2257,MRK,4,KJV,and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them
2258,MRK,4,KJV,let us pass over unto the other side
2259,MRK,4,KJV,and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships
2260,MRK,4,KJV,and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full
2261,MRK,4,KJV,and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish
2262,MRK,4,KJV,and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea
2263,MRK,4,KJV,peace be still
2264,MRK,4,KJV,and the wind ceased and there was a great calm
2265,MRK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
2266,MRK,4,KJV,why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith
2267,MRK,4,KJV,and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
2268,MRK,5,KJV,and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes
2269,MRK,5,KJV,and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
2270,MRK,5,KJV,who had
2271,MRK,5,KJV,his
2272,MRK,5,KJV,dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains
2273,MRK,5,KJV,because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any
2274,MRK,5,KJV,man
2275,MRK,5,KJV,tame him
2276,MRK,5,KJV,and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones
2277,MRK,5,KJV,but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him
2278,MRK,5,KJV,and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus
2279,MRK,5,KJV,thou
2280,MRK,5,KJV,son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not
2281,MRK,5,KJV,for he said unto him
2282,MRK,5,KJV,come out of the man
2283,MRK,5,KJV,thou
2284,MRK,5,KJV,unclean spirit
2285,MRK,5,KJV,and he asked him
2286,MRK,5,KJV,what
2287,MRK,5,KJV,is
2288,MRK,5,KJV,thy name
2289,MRK,5,KJV,and he answered saying my name
2290,MRK,5,KJV,is
2291,MRK,5,KJV,legion for we are many
2292,MRK,5,KJV,and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country
2293,MRK,5,KJV,now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding
2294,MRK,5,KJV,and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them
2295,MRK,5,KJV,and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the sea
2296,MRK,5,KJV,and they that fed the swine fled and told
2297,MRK,5,KJV,it
2298,MRK,5,KJV,in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done
2299,MRK,5,KJV,and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
2300,MRK,5,KJV,and they that saw
2301,MRK,5,KJV,it
2302,MRK,5,KJV,told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and
2303,MRK,5,KJV,also
2304,MRK,5,KJV,concerning the swine
2305,MRK,5,KJV,and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
2306,MRK,5,KJV,and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
2307,MRK,5,KJV,howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him
2308,MRK,5,KJV,go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee
2309,MRK,5,KJV,and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all
2310,MRK,5,KJV,men
2311,MRK,5,KJV,did marvel
2312,MRK,5,KJV,and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea
2313,MRK,5,KJV,and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet
2314,MRK,5,KJV,and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death
2315,MRK,5,KJV,i pray thee
2316,MRK,5,KJV,come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live
2317,MRK,5,KJV,and
2318,MRK,5,KJV,jesus
2319,MRK,5,KJV,went with him and much people followed him and thronged him
2320,MRK,5,KJV,and a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years
2321,MRK,5,KJV,and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse
2322,MRK,5,KJV,when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment
2323,MRK,5,KJV,for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole
2324,MRK,5,KJV,and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in
2325,MRK,5,KJV,her
2326,MRK,5,KJV,body that she was healed of that plague
2327,MRK,5,KJV,and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said
2328,MRK,5,KJV,who touched my clothes
2329,MRK,5,KJV,and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me
2330,MRK,5,KJV,and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
2331,MRK,5,KJV,but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth
2332,MRK,5,KJV,and he said unto her
2333,MRK,5,KJV,daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague
2334,MRK,5,KJV,while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues
2335,MRK,5,KJV,house certain
2336,MRK,5,KJV,which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further
2337,MRK,5,KJV,as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue
2338,MRK,5,KJV,be not afraid only believe
2339,MRK,5,KJV,and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james and john the brother of james
2340,MRK,5,KJV,and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly
2341,MRK,5,KJV,and when he was come in he saith unto them
2342,MRK,5,KJV,why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
2343,MRK,5,KJV,and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying
2344,MRK,5,KJV,and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her
2345,MRK,5,KJV,talitha cumi
2346,MRK,5,KJV,which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise
2347,MRK,5,KJV,and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was
2348,MRK,5,KJV,of the age
2349,MRK,5,KJV,of twelve years and they were astonished with a great astonishment
2350,MRK,5,KJV,and he charged them straitly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat
2351,MRK,6,KJV,and he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him
2352,MRK,6,KJV,and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing
2353,MRK,6,KJV,him
2354,MRK,6,KJV,were astonished saying from whence hath this
2355,MRK,6,KJV,man
2356,MRK,6,KJV,these things and what wisdom
2357,MRK,6,KJV,is
2358,MRK,6,KJV,this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands
2359,MRK,6,KJV,is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him
2360,MRK,6,KJV,but jesus said unto them
2361,MRK,6,KJV,a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house
2362,MRK,6,KJV,and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed
2363,MRK,6,KJV,them
2364,MRK,6,KJV,
2365,MRK,6,KJV,and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching
2366,MRK,6,KJV,and he called
2367,MRK,6,KJV,unto him
2368,MRK,6,KJV,the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits
2369,MRK,6,KJV,and commanded them that they should take nothing for
2370,MRK,6,KJV,their
2371,MRK,6,KJV,journey save a staff only no scrip no bread no money in
2372,MRK,6,KJV,their
2373,MRK,6,KJV,purse
2374,MRK,6,KJV,but
2375,MRK,6,KJV,be
2376,MRK,6,KJV,shod with sandals and not put on two coats
2377,MRK,6,KJV,and he said unto them
2378,MRK,6,KJV,in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place
2379,MRK,6,KJV,and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
2380,MRK,6,KJV,and they went out and preached that men should repent
2381,MRK,6,KJV,and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed
2382,MRK,6,KJV,them
2383,MRK,6,KJV,and king herod heard
2384,MRK,6,KJV,of him
2385,MRK,6,KJV,for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
2386,MRK,6,KJV,others said that it is elias and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets
2387,MRK,6,KJV,but when herod heard
2388,MRK,6,KJV,thereof
2389,MRK,6,KJV,he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead
2390,MRK,6,KJV,for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her
2391,MRK,6,KJV,for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife
2392,MRK,6,KJV,therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not
2393,MRK,6,KJV,for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly
2394,MRK,6,KJV,and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief
2395,MRK,6,KJV,estates
2396,MRK,6,KJV,of galilee
2397,MRK,6,KJV,and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give
2398,MRK,6,KJV,it
2399,MRK,6,KJV,thee
2400,MRK,6,KJV,and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give
2401,MRK,6,KJV,it
2402,MRK,6,KJV,thee unto the half of my kingdom
2403,MRK,6,KJV,and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptist
2404,MRK,6,KJV,and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist
2405,MRK,6,KJV,and the king was exceeding sorry
2406,MRK,6,KJV,yet
2407,MRK,6,KJV,for his oaths sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her
2408,MRK,6,KJV,and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison
2409,MRK,6,KJV,and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother
2410,MRK,6,KJV,and when his disciples heard
2411,MRK,6,KJV,of it
2412,MRK,6,KJV,they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb
2413,MRK,6,KJV,and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught
2414,MRK,6,KJV,and he said unto them
2415,MRK,6,KJV,come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while
2416,MRK,6,KJV,for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat
2417,MRK,6,KJV,and they departed into a desert place by ship privately
2418,MRK,6,KJV,and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him
2419,MRK,6,KJV,and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things
2420,MRK,6,KJV,and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time
2421,MRK,6,KJV,is
2422,MRK,6,KJV,far passed
2423,MRK,6,KJV,send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat
2424,MRK,6,KJV,he answered and said unto them
2425,MRK,6,KJV,give ye them to eat
2426,MRK,6,KJV,and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat
2427,MRK,6,KJV,he saith unto them
2428,MRK,6,KJV,how many loaves have ye go and see
2429,MRK,6,KJV,and when they knew they say five and two fishes
2430,MRK,6,KJV,and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass
2431,MRK,6,KJV,and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties
2432,MRK,6,KJV,and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave
2433,MRK,6,KJV,them
2434,MRK,6,KJV,to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all
2435,MRK,6,KJV,and they did all eat and were filled
2436,MRK,6,KJV,and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes
2437,MRK,6,KJV,and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
2438,MRK,6,KJV,and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people
2439,MRK,6,KJV,and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray
2440,MRK,6,KJV,and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land
2441,MRK,6,KJV,and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them
2442,MRK,6,KJV,but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out
2443,MRK,6,KJV,for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them
2444,MRK,6,KJV,be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
2445,MRK,6,KJV,and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered
2446,MRK,6,KJV,for they considered not
2447,MRK,6,KJV,the miracle
2448,MRK,6,KJV,of the loaves for their heart was hardened
2449,MRK,6,KJV,and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore
2450,MRK,6,KJV,and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him
2451,MRK,6,KJV,and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was
2452,MRK,6,KJV,and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole
2453,MRK,7,KJV,then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from jerusalem
2454,MRK,7,KJV,and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say with unwashen hands they found fault
2455,MRK,7,KJV,for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash
2456,MRK,7,KJV,their
2457,MRK,7,KJV,hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders
2458,MRK,7,KJV,and
2459,MRK,7,KJV,when they come
2460,MRK,7,KJV,from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold
2461,MRK,7,KJV,as
2462,MRK,7,KJV,the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables
2463,MRK,7,KJV,then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands
2464,MRK,7,KJV,he answered and said unto them
2465,MRK,7,KJV,well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written
2466,MRK,7,KJV,this people honoureth me with
2467,MRK,7,KJV,their
2468,MRK,7,KJV,lips
2469,MRK,7,KJV,but their heart is far from me
2470,MRK,7,KJV,howbeit in vain do they worship me
2471,MRK,7,KJV,teaching
2472,MRK,7,KJV,for
2473,MRK,7,KJV,doctrines the commandments of men
2474,MRK,7,KJV,for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men
2475,MRK,7,KJV,as
2476,MRK,7,KJV,the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do
2477,MRK,7,KJV,and he said unto them
2478,MRK,7,KJV,full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
2479,MRK,7,KJV,for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death
2480,MRK,7,KJV,but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother
2481,MRK,7,KJV,it is
2482,MRK,7,KJV,corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me
2483,MRK,7,KJV,he shall be free
2484,MRK,7,KJV,and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
2485,MRK,7,KJV,making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
2486,MRK,7,KJV,and when he had called all the people
2487,MRK,7,KJV,unto him
2488,MRK,7,KJV,he said unto them
2489,MRK,7,KJV,hearken unto me every one
2490,MRK,7,KJV,of you
2491,MRK,7,KJV,and understand
2492,MRK,7,KJV,there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man
2493,MRK,7,KJV,if any man have ears to hear let him hear
2494,MRK,7,KJV,and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable
2495,MRK,7,KJV,and he saith unto them
2496,MRK,7,KJV,are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man
2497,MRK,7,KJV,it
2498,MRK,7,KJV,cannot defile him
2499,MRK,7,KJV,because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all meats
2500,MRK,7,KJV,and he said
2501,MRK,7,KJV,that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man
2502,MRK,7,KJV,for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders
2503,MRK,7,KJV,thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness
2504,MRK,7,KJV,all these evil things come from within and defile the man
2505,MRK,7,KJV,and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know
2506,MRK,7,KJV,it
2507,MRK,7,KJV,but he could not be hid
2508,MRK,7,KJV,for a
2509,MRK,7,KJV,certain
2510,MRK,7,KJV,woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet
2511,MRK,7,KJV,the woman was a greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter
2512,MRK,7,KJV,but jesus said unto her
2513,MRK,7,KJV,let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast
2514,MRK,7,KJV,it
2515,MRK,7,KJV,unto the dogs
2516,MRK,7,KJV,and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbs
2517,MRK,7,KJV,and he said unto her
2518,MRK,7,KJV,for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter
2519,MRK,7,KJV,and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed
2520,MRK,7,KJV,and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he came unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis
2521,MRK,7,KJV,and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him
2522,MRK,7,KJV,and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue
2523,MRK,7,KJV,and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him
2524,MRK,7,KJV,ephphatha
2525,MRK,7,KJV,that is be opened
2526,MRK,7,KJV,and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain
2527,MRK,7,KJV,and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published
2528,MRK,7,KJV,it
2529,MRK,7,KJV,
2530,MRK,7,KJV,and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak
2531,MRK,8,KJV,in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat jesus called his disciples
2532,MRK,8,KJV,unto him
2533,MRK,8,KJV,and saith unto them
2534,MRK,8,KJV,i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat
2535,MRK,8,KJV,and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far
2536,MRK,8,KJV,and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these
2537,MRK,8,KJV,men
2538,MRK,8,KJV,with bread here in the wilderness
2539,MRK,8,KJV,and he asked them
2540,MRK,8,KJV,how many loaves have ye
2541,MRK,8,KJV,and they said seven
2542,MRK,8,KJV,and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before
2543,MRK,8,KJV,them
2544,MRK,8,KJV,and they did set
2545,MRK,8,KJV,them
2546,MRK,8,KJV,before the people
2547,MRK,8,KJV,and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before
2548,MRK,8,KJV,them
2549,MRK,8,KJV,
2550,MRK,8,KJV,so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken
2551,MRK,8,KJV,meat
2552,MRK,8,KJV,that was left seven baskets
2553,MRK,8,KJV,and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away
2554,MRK,8,KJV,and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha
2555,MRK,8,KJV,and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him
2556,MRK,8,KJV,and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith
2557,MRK,8,KJV,why doth this generation seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation
2558,MRK,8,KJV,and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side
2559,MRK,8,KJV,now
2560,MRK,8,KJV,the disciples
2561,MRK,8,KJV,had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf
2562,MRK,8,KJV,and he charged them saying
2563,MRK,8,KJV,take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and
2564,MRK,8,KJV,of
2565,MRK,8,KJV,the leaven of herod
2566,MRK,8,KJV,and they reasoned among themselves saying
2567,MRK,8,KJV,it is
2568,MRK,8,KJV,because we have no bread
2569,MRK,8,KJV,and when jesus knew
2570,MRK,8,KJV,it
2571,MRK,8,KJV,he saith unto them
2572,MRK,8,KJV,why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet hardened
2573,MRK,8,KJV,having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember
2574,MRK,8,KJV,when i brake the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up
2575,MRK,8,KJV,they say unto him twelve
2576,MRK,8,KJV,and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up
2577,MRK,8,KJV,and they said seven
2578,MRK,8,KJV,and he said unto them
2579,MRK,8,KJV,how is it that ye do not understand
2580,MRK,8,KJV,and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him
2581,MRK,8,KJV,and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought
2582,MRK,8,KJV,and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking
2583,MRK,8,KJV,after that he put
2584,MRK,8,KJV,his
2585,MRK,8,KJV,hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly
2586,MRK,8,KJV,and he sent him away to his house saying
2587,MRK,8,KJV,neither go into the town nor tell
2588,MRK,8,KJV,it
2589,MRK,8,KJV,to any in the town
2590,MRK,8,KJV,and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them
2591,MRK,8,KJV,whom do men say that i am
2592,MRK,8,KJV,and they answered john the baptist but some
2593,MRK,8,KJV,say
2594,MRK,8,KJV,elias and others one of the prophets
2595,MRK,8,KJV,and he saith unto them
2596,MRK,8,KJV,but whom say ye that i am
2597,MRK,8,KJV,and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ
2598,MRK,8,KJV,and he charged them that they should tell no man of him
2599,MRK,8,KJV,and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and
2600,MRK,8,KJV,of
2601,MRK,8,KJV,the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
2602,MRK,8,KJV,and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him
2603,MRK,8,KJV,but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying
2604,MRK,8,KJV,get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the things that be of god but the things that be of men
2605,MRK,8,KJV,and when he had called the people
2606,MRK,8,KJV,unto him
2607,MRK,8,KJV,with his disciples also he said unto them
2608,MRK,8,KJV,whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
2609,MRK,8,KJV,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it
2610,MRK,8,KJV,for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
2611,MRK,8,KJV,or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
2612,MRK,8,KJV,whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels
2613,MRK,9,KJV,and he said unto them
2614,MRK,9,KJV,verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power
2615,MRK,9,KJV,and after six days jesus taketh
2616,MRK,9,KJV,with him
2617,MRK,9,KJV,peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them
2618,MRK,9,KJV,and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them
2619,MRK,9,KJV,and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus
2620,MRK,9,KJV,and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
2621,MRK,9,KJV,for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid
2622,MRK,9,KJV,and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
2623,MRK,9,KJV,and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man any more save jesus only with themselves
2624,MRK,9,KJV,and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead
2625,MRK,9,KJV,and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean
2626,MRK,9,KJV,and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias must first come
2627,MRK,9,KJV,and he answered and told them
2628,MRK,9,KJV,elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought
2629,MRK,9,KJV,but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him
2630,MRK,9,KJV,and when he came to
2631,MRK,9,KJV,his
2632,MRK,9,KJV,disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them
2633,MRK,9,KJV,and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to
2634,MRK,9,KJV,him
2635,MRK,9,KJV,saluted him
2636,MRK,9,KJV,and he asked the scribes
2637,MRK,9,KJV,what question ye with them
2638,MRK,9,KJV,and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit
2639,MRK,9,KJV,and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not
2640,MRK,9,KJV,he answereth him and saith
2641,MRK,9,KJV,o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me
2642,MRK,9,KJV,and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming
2643,MRK,9,KJV,and he asked his father
2644,MRK,9,KJV,how long is it ago since this came unto him
2645,MRK,9,KJV,and he said of a child
2646,MRK,9,KJV,and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us and help us
2647,MRK,9,KJV,jesus said unto him
2648,MRK,9,KJV,if thou canst believe all things
2649,MRK,9,KJV,are
2650,MRK,9,KJV,possible to him that believeth
2651,MRK,9,KJV,and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
2652,MRK,9,KJV,when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him
2653,MRK,9,KJV,thou
2654,MRK,9,KJV,dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him
2655,MRK,9,KJV,and
2656,MRK,9,KJV,the spirit
2657,MRK,9,KJV,cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead
2658,MRK,9,KJV,but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose
2659,MRK,9,KJV,and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out
2660,MRK,9,KJV,and he said unto them
2661,MRK,9,KJV,this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting
2662,MRK,9,KJV,and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know
2663,MRK,9,KJV,it
2664,MRK,9,KJV,
2665,MRK,9,KJV,for he taught his disciples and said unto them
2666,MRK,9,KJV,the son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day
2667,MRK,9,KJV,but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him
2668,MRK,9,KJV,and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them
2669,MRK,9,KJV,what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way
2670,MRK,9,KJV,but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who
2671,MRK,9,KJV,should be
2672,MRK,9,KJV,the greatest
2673,MRK,9,KJV,and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them
2674,MRK,9,KJV,if any man desire to be first
2675,MRK,9,KJV,the same
2676,MRK,9,KJV,shall be last of all and servant of all
2677,MRK,9,KJV,and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them
2678,MRK,9,KJV,whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me
2679,MRK,9,KJV,and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not us
2680,MRK,9,KJV,but jesus said
2681,MRK,9,KJV,forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me
2682,MRK,9,KJV,for he that is not against us is on our part
2683,MRK,9,KJV,for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward
2684,MRK,9,KJV,and whosoever shall offend one of
2685,MRK,9,KJV,these
2686,MRK,9,KJV,little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea
2687,MRK,9,KJV,and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
2688,MRK,9,KJV,where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
2689,MRK,9,KJV,and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
2690,MRK,9,KJV,where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
2691,MRK,9,KJV,and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
2692,MRK,9,KJV,where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
2693,MRK,9,KJV,for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt
2694,MRK,9,KJV,salt
2695,MRK,9,KJV,is
2696,MRK,9,KJV,good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another
2697,MRK,10,KJV,and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again
2698,MRK,10,KJV,and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away
2699,MRK,10,KJV,his
2700,MRK,10,KJV,wife tempting him
2701,MRK,10,KJV,and he answered and said unto them
2702,MRK,10,KJV,what did moses command you
2703,MRK,10,KJV,and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put
2704,MRK,10,KJV,her
2705,MRK,10,KJV,away
2706,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them
2707,MRK,10,KJV,for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept
2708,MRK,10,KJV,but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female
2709,MRK,10,KJV,for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife
2710,MRK,10,KJV,and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh
2711,MRK,10,KJV,what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
2712,MRK,10,KJV,and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
2713,MRK,10,KJV,matter
2714,MRK,10,KJV,
2715,MRK,10,KJV,and he saith unto them
2716,MRK,10,KJV,whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her
2717,MRK,10,KJV,and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery
2718,MRK,10,KJV,and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and
2719,MRK,10,KJV,his
2720,MRK,10,KJV,disciples rebuked those that brought
2721,MRK,10,KJV,them
2722,MRK,10,KJV,
2723,MRK,10,KJV,but when jesus saw
2724,MRK,10,KJV,it
2725,MRK,10,KJV,he was much displeased and said unto them
2726,MRK,10,KJV,suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
2727,MRK,10,KJV,verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein
2728,MRK,10,KJV,and he took them up in his arms put
2729,MRK,10,KJV,his
2730,MRK,10,KJV,hands upon them and blessed them
2731,MRK,10,KJV,and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life
2732,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus said unto him
2733,MRK,10,KJV,why callest thou me good
2734,MRK,10,KJV,there is
2735,MRK,10,KJV,none good but one
2736,MRK,10,KJV,that is
2737,MRK,10,KJV,god
2738,MRK,10,KJV,thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother
2739,MRK,10,KJV,and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth
2740,MRK,10,KJV,then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him
2741,MRK,10,KJV,one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me
2742,MRK,10,KJV,and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions
2743,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples
2744,MRK,10,KJV,how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
2745,MRK,10,KJV,and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them
2746,MRK,10,KJV,children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god
2747,MRK,10,KJV,it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
2748,MRK,10,KJV,and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved
2749,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus looking upon them saith
2750,MRK,10,KJV,with men
2751,MRK,10,KJV,it is
2752,MRK,10,KJV,impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
2753,MRK,10,KJV,then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee
2754,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus answered and said
2755,MRK,10,KJV,verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels
2756,MRK,10,KJV,but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life
2757,MRK,10,KJV,but many
2758,MRK,10,KJV,that are
2759,MRK,10,KJV,first shall be last and the last first
2760,MRK,10,KJV,and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him
2761,MRK,10,KJV,saying
2762,MRK,10,KJV,
2763,MRK,10,KJV,behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles
2764,MRK,10,KJV,and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again
2765,MRK,10,KJV,and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire
2766,MRK,10,KJV,and he said unto them
2767,MRK,10,KJV,what would ye that i should do for you
2768,MRK,10,KJV,they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory
2769,MRK,10,KJV,but jesus said unto them
2770,MRK,10,KJV,ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
2771,MRK,10,KJV,and they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them
2772,MRK,10,KJV,ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized
2773,MRK,10,KJV,but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but
2774,MRK,10,KJV,it shall be given to them
2775,MRK,10,KJV,for whom it is prepared
2776,MRK,10,KJV,and when the ten heard
2777,MRK,10,KJV,it
2778,MRK,10,KJV,they began to be much displeased with james and john
2779,MRK,10,KJV,but jesus called them
2780,MRK,10,KJV,to him
2781,MRK,10,KJV,and saith unto them
2782,MRK,10,KJV,ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them
2783,MRK,10,KJV,but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister
2784,MRK,10,KJV,and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all
2785,MRK,10,KJV,for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
2786,MRK,10,KJV,and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging
2787,MRK,10,KJV,and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus
2788,MRK,10,KJV,thou
2789,MRK,10,KJV,son of david have mercy on me
2790,MRK,10,KJV,and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal
2791,MRK,10,KJV,thou
2792,MRK,10,KJV,son of david have mercy on me
2793,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee
2794,MRK,10,KJV,and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus
2795,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto him
2796,MRK,10,KJV,what wilt thou that i should do unto thee
2797,MRK,10,KJV,the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight
2798,MRK,10,KJV,and jesus said unto him
2799,MRK,10,KJV,go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole
2800,MRK,10,KJV,and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way
2801,MRK,11,KJV,and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples
2802,MRK,11,KJV,and saith unto them
2803,MRK,11,KJV,go your way into the village over against you and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon never man sat loose him and bring
2804,MRK,11,KJV,him
2805,MRK,11,KJV,and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither
2806,MRK,11,KJV,and they went their way and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose him
2807,MRK,11,KJV,and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt
2808,MRK,11,KJV,and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go
2809,MRK,11,KJV,and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him
2810,MRK,11,KJV,and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed
2811,MRK,11,KJV,them
2812,MRK,11,KJV,in the way
2813,MRK,11,KJV,and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed
2814,MRK,11,KJV,is
2815,MRK,11,KJV,he that cometh in the name of the lord
2816,MRK,11,KJV,blessed
2817,MRK,11,KJV,be
2818,MRK,11,KJV,the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
2819,MRK,11,KJV,and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide was come he went out unto bethany with the twelve
2820,MRK,11,KJV,and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry
2821,MRK,11,KJV,and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not
2822,MRK,11,KJV,yet
2823,MRK,11,KJV,
2824,MRK,11,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto it
2825,MRK,11,KJV,no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever
2826,MRK,11,KJV,and his disciples heard
2827,MRK,11,KJV,it
2828,MRK,11,KJV,and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
2829,MRK,11,KJV,and would not suffer that any man should carry
2830,MRK,11,KJV,any
2831,MRK,11,KJV,vessel through the temple
2832,MRK,11,KJV,and he taught saying unto them
2833,MRK,11,KJV,is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
2834,MRK,11,KJV,and the scribes and chief priests heard
2835,MRK,11,KJV,it
2836,MRK,11,KJV,and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine
2837,MRK,11,KJV,and when even was come he went out of the city
2838,MRK,11,KJV,and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
2839,MRK,11,KJV,and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away
2840,MRK,11,KJV,and jesus answering saith unto them
2841,MRK,11,KJV,have faith in god
2842,MRK,11,KJV,for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
2843,MRK,11,KJV,therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive
2844,MRK,11,KJV,them
2845,MRK,11,KJV,and ye shall have
2846,MRK,11,KJV,them
2847,MRK,11,KJV,and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
2848,MRK,11,KJV,but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses
2849,MRK,11,KJV,and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
2850,MRK,11,KJV,and say unto him by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things
2851,MRK,11,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them
2852,MRK,11,KJV,i will also ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
2853,MRK,11,KJV,the baptism of john was
2854,MRK,11,KJV,it
2855,MRK,11,KJV,from heaven or of men answer me
2856,MRK,11,KJV,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him
2857,MRK,11,KJV,but if we shall say of men they feared the people for all
2858,MRK,11,KJV,men
2859,MRK,11,KJV,counted john that he was a prophet indeed
2860,MRK,11,KJV,and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus answering saith unto them
2861,MRK,11,KJV,neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things
2862,MRK,12,KJV,and he began to speak unto them by parables
2863,MRK,12,KJV,a
2864,MRK,12,KJV,certain
2865,MRK,12,KJV,man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about
2866,MRK,12,KJV,it
2867,MRK,12,KJV,and digged
2868,MRK,12,KJV,a place for
2869,MRK,12,KJV,the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
2870,MRK,12,KJV,and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
2871,MRK,12,KJV,and they caught
2872,MRK,12,KJV,him
2873,MRK,12,KJV,and beat him and sent
2874,MRK,12,KJV,him
2875,MRK,12,KJV,away empty
2876,MRK,12,KJV,and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded
2877,MRK,12,KJV,him
2878,MRK,12,KJV,in the head and sent
2879,MRK,12,KJV,him
2880,MRK,12,KJV,away shamefully handled
2881,MRK,12,KJV,and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some
2882,MRK,12,KJV,having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son
2883,MRK,12,KJV,but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours
2884,MRK,12,KJV,and they took him and killed
2885,MRK,12,KJV,him
2886,MRK,12,KJV,and cast
2887,MRK,12,KJV,him
2888,MRK,12,KJV,out of the vineyard
2889,MRK,12,KJV,what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others
2890,MRK,12,KJV,and have ye not read this scripture
2891,MRK,12,KJV,the stone which the builders rejected
2892,MRK,12,KJV,is become the head of the corner
2893,MRK,12,KJV,this was the lords doing
2894,MRK,12,KJV,and it is marvellous in our eyes
2895,MRK,12,KJV,and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way
2896,MRK,12,KJV,and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in
2897,MRK,12,KJV,his
2898,MRK,12,KJV,words
2899,MRK,12,KJV,and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not
2900,MRK,12,KJV,shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them
2901,MRK,12,KJV,why tempt ye me bring me a penny that i may see
2902,MRK,12,KJV,it
2903,MRK,12,KJV,and they brought
2904,MRK,12,KJV,it
2905,MRK,12,KJV,and he saith unto them
2906,MRK,12,KJV,whose
2907,MRK,12,KJV,is
2908,MRK,12,KJV,this image and superscription
2909,MRK,12,KJV,and they said unto him caesars
2910,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them
2911,MRK,12,KJV,render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods
2912,MRK,12,KJV,and they marvelled at him
2913,MRK,12,KJV,then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying
2914,MRK,12,KJV,master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave
2915,MRK,12,KJV,his
2916,MRK,12,KJV,wife
2917,MRK,12,KJV,behind him
2918,MRK,12,KJV,and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
2919,MRK,12,KJV,now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed
2920,MRK,12,KJV,and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise
2921,MRK,12,KJV,and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also
2922,MRK,12,KJV,in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife
2923,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them
2924,MRK,12,KJV,do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god
2925,MRK,12,KJV,for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven
2926,MRK,12,KJV,and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i
2927,MRK,12,KJV,am
2928,MRK,12,KJV,the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
2929,MRK,12,KJV,he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err
2930,MRK,12,KJV,and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all
2931,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answered him
2932,MRK,12,KJV,the first of all the commandments
2933,MRK,12,KJV,is
2934,MRK,12,KJV,hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
2935,MRK,12,KJV,and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this
2936,MRK,12,KJV,is
2937,MRK,12,KJV,the first commandment
2938,MRK,12,KJV,and the second
2939,MRK,12,KJV,is
2940,MRK,12,KJV,like
2941,MRK,12,KJV,namely
2942,MRK,12,KJV,this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these
2943,MRK,12,KJV,and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he
2944,MRK,12,KJV,and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love
2945,MRK,12,KJV,his
2946,MRK,12,KJV,neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
2947,MRK,12,KJV,and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him
2948,MRK,12,KJV,thou art not far from the kingdom of god
2949,MRK,12,KJV,and no man after that durst ask him
2950,MRK,12,KJV,any question
2951,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple
2952,MRK,12,KJV,how say the scribes that christ is the son of david
2953,MRK,12,KJV,for david himself said by the holy ghost
2954,MRK,12,KJV,the
2955,MRK,12,KJV,lord
2956,MRK,12,KJV,said to my lord
2957,MRK,12,KJV,sit thou on my right hand
2958,MRK,12,KJV,till i make thine enemies thy footstool
2959,MRK,12,KJV,david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he
2960,MRK,12,KJV,then
2961,MRK,12,KJV,his son
2962,MRK,12,KJV,and the common people heard him gladly
2963,MRK,12,KJV,and he said unto them in his doctrine
2964,MRK,12,KJV,beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and
2965,MRK,12,KJV,love
2966,MRK,12,KJV,salutations in the marketplaces
2967,MRK,12,KJV,and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts
2968,MRK,12,KJV,which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation
2969,MRK,12,KJV,and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much
2970,MRK,12,KJV,and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing
2971,MRK,12,KJV,and he called
2972,MRK,12,KJV,unto him
2973,MRK,12,KJV,his disciples and saith unto them
2974,MRK,12,KJV,verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury
2975,MRK,12,KJV,for all
2976,MRK,12,KJV,they
2977,MRK,12,KJV,did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had
2978,MRK,12,KJV,even
2979,MRK,12,KJV,all her living
2980,MRK,13,KJV,and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings
2981,MRK,13,KJV,are here
2982,MRK,13,KJV,and jesus answering said unto him
2983,MRK,13,KJV,seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
2984,MRK,13,KJV,and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately
2985,MRK,13,KJV,tell us when shall these things be and what
2986,MRK,13,KJV,shall be
2987,MRK,13,KJV,the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled
2988,MRK,13,KJV,and jesus answering them began to say
2989,MRK,13,KJV,take heed lest any
2990,MRK,13,KJV,man
2991,MRK,13,KJV,deceive you
2992,MRK,13,KJV,for many shall come in my name saying i am
2993,MRK,13,KJV,christ
2994,MRK,13,KJV,and shall deceive many
2995,MRK,13,KJV,and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for
2996,MRK,13,KJV,such things
2997,MRK,13,KJV,must needs be but the end
2998,MRK,13,KJV,shall
2999,MRK,13,KJV,not
3000,MRK,13,KJV,be
3001,MRK,13,KJV,yet
3002,MRK,13,KJV,for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these
3003,MRK,13,KJV,are
3004,MRK,13,KJV,the beginnings of sorrows
3005,MRK,13,KJV,but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them
3006,MRK,13,KJV,and the gospel must first be published among all nations
3007,MRK,13,KJV,but when they shall lead
3008,MRK,13,KJV,you
3009,MRK,13,KJV,and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost
3010,MRK,13,KJV,now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against
3011,MRK,13,KJV,their
3012,MRK,13,KJV,parents and shall cause them to be put to death
3013,MRK,13,KJV,and ye shall be hated of all
3014,MRK,13,KJV,men
3015,MRK,13,KJV,for my names sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
3016,MRK,13,KJV,but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains
3017,MRK,13,KJV,and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter
3018,MRK,13,KJV,therein
3019,MRK,13,KJV,to take any thing out of his house
3020,MRK,13,KJV,and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment
3021,MRK,13,KJV,but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
3022,MRK,13,KJV,and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
3023,MRK,13,KJV,for
3024,MRK,13,KJV,in
3025,MRK,13,KJV,those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be
3026,MRK,13,KJV,and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days
3027,MRK,13,KJV,and then if any man shall say to you lo here
3028,MRK,13,KJV,is
3029,MRK,13,KJV,christ or lo
3030,MRK,13,KJV,he is
3031,MRK,13,KJV,there believe
3032,MRK,13,KJV,him
3033,MRK,13,KJV,not
3034,MRK,13,KJV,for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if
3035,MRK,13,KJV,it were
3036,MRK,13,KJV,possible even the elect
3037,MRK,13,KJV,but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things
3038,MRK,13,KJV,but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light
3039,MRK,13,KJV,and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken
3040,MRK,13,KJV,and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
3041,MRK,13,KJV,and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
3042,MRK,13,KJV,now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near
3043,MRK,13,KJV,so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh
3044,MRK,13,KJV,even
3045,MRK,13,KJV,at the doors
3046,MRK,13,KJV,verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done
3047,MRK,13,KJV,heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
3048,MRK,13,KJV,but of that day and
3049,MRK,13,KJV,that
3050,MRK,13,KJV,hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father
3051,MRK,13,KJV,take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is
3052,MRK,13,KJV,for the son of man is
3053,MRK,13,KJV,as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch
3054,MRK,13,KJV,watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning
3055,MRK,13,KJV,lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
3056,MRK,13,KJV,and what i say unto you i say unto all watch
3057,MRK,14,KJV,after two days was
3058,MRK,14,KJV,the feast of
3059,MRK,14,KJV,the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put
3060,MRK,14,KJV,him
3061,MRK,14,KJV,to death
3062,MRK,14,KJV,but they said not on the feast
3063,MRK,14,KJV,day
3064,MRK,14,KJV,lest there be an uproar of the people
3065,MRK,14,KJV,and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured
3066,MRK,14,KJV,it
3067,MRK,14,KJV,on his head
3068,MRK,14,KJV,and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made
3069,MRK,14,KJV,for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her
3070,MRK,14,KJV,and jesus said
3071,MRK,14,KJV,let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me
3072,MRK,14,KJV,for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always
3073,MRK,14,KJV,she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying
3074,MRK,14,KJV,verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world
3075,MRK,14,KJV,this
3076,MRK,14,KJV,also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her
3077,MRK,14,KJV,and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them
3078,MRK,14,KJV,and when they heard
3079,MRK,14,KJV,it
3080,MRK,14,KJV,they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him
3081,MRK,14,KJV,and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover
3082,MRK,14,KJV,and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them
3083,MRK,14,KJV,go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him
3084,MRK,14,KJV,and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples
3085,MRK,14,KJV,and he will shew you a large upper room furnished
3086,MRK,14,KJV,and
3087,MRK,14,KJV,prepared there make ready for us
3088,MRK,14,KJV,and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
3089,MRK,14,KJV,and in the evening he cometh with the twelve
3090,MRK,14,KJV,and as they sat and did eat jesus said
3091,MRK,14,KJV,verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me
3092,MRK,14,KJV,and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one
3093,MRK,14,KJV,is
3094,MRK,14,KJV,it i and another
3095,MRK,14,KJV,said is
3096,MRK,14,KJV,it i
3097,MRK,14,KJV,and he answered and said unto them
3098,MRK,14,KJV,it is
3099,MRK,14,KJV,one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish
3100,MRK,14,KJV,the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born
3101,MRK,14,KJV,and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brake
3102,MRK,14,KJV,it
3103,MRK,14,KJV,and gave to them and said
3104,MRK,14,KJV,take eat this is my body
3105,MRK,14,KJV,and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave
3106,MRK,14,KJV,it
3107,MRK,14,KJV,to them and they all drank of it
3108,MRK,14,KJV,and he said unto them
3109,MRK,14,KJV,this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many
3110,MRK,14,KJV,verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god
3111,MRK,14,KJV,and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
3112,MRK,14,KJV,and jesus saith unto them
3113,MRK,14,KJV,all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered
3114,MRK,14,KJV,but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee
3115,MRK,14,KJV,but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet
3116,MRK,14,KJV,will
3117,MRK,14,KJV,not i
3118,MRK,14,KJV,and jesus saith unto him
3119,MRK,14,KJV,verily i say unto thee that this day
3120,MRK,14,KJV,even
3121,MRK,14,KJV,in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice
3122,MRK,14,KJV,but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all
3123,MRK,14,KJV,and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples
3124,MRK,14,KJV,sit ye here while i shall pray
3125,MRK,14,KJV,and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy
3126,MRK,14,KJV,and saith unto them
3127,MRK,14,KJV,my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch
3128,MRK,14,KJV,and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
3129,MRK,14,KJV,and he said
3130,MRK,14,KJV,abba father all things
3131,MRK,14,KJV,are
3132,MRK,14,KJV,possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt
3133,MRK,14,KJV,and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter
3134,MRK,14,KJV,simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour
3135,MRK,14,KJV,watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly
3136,MRK,14,KJV,is
3137,MRK,14,KJV,ready but the flesh
3138,MRK,14,KJV,is
3139,MRK,14,KJV,weak
3140,MRK,14,KJV,and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words
3141,MRK,14,KJV,and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him
3142,MRK,14,KJV,and he cometh the third time and saith unto them
3143,MRK,14,KJV,sleep on now and take
3144,MRK,14,KJV,your
3145,MRK,14,KJV,rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
3146,MRK,14,KJV,rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand
3147,MRK,14,KJV,and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
3148,MRK,14,KJV,and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead
3149,MRK,14,KJV,him
3150,MRK,14,KJV,away safely
3151,MRK,14,KJV,and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and saith master master and kissed him
3152,MRK,14,KJV,and they laid their hands on him and took him
3153,MRK,14,KJV,and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
3154,MRK,14,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto them
3155,MRK,14,KJV,are ye come out as against a thief with swords and
3156,MRK,14,KJV,with
3157,MRK,14,KJV,staves to take me
3158,MRK,14,KJV,i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled
3159,MRK,14,KJV,and they all forsook him and fled
3160,MRK,14,KJV,and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about
3161,MRK,14,KJV,his
3162,MRK,14,KJV,naked
3163,MRK,14,KJV,body
3164,MRK,14,KJV,and the young men laid hold on him
3165,MRK,14,KJV,and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked
3166,MRK,14,KJV,and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes
3167,MRK,14,KJV,and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire
3168,MRK,14,KJV,and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none
3169,MRK,14,KJV,for many bare false witness against him but their witness agreed not together
3170,MRK,14,KJV,and there arose certain and bare false witness against him saying
3171,MRK,14,KJV,we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands
3172,MRK,14,KJV,but neither so did their witness agree together
3173,MRK,14,KJV,and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what
3174,MRK,14,KJV,is it which
3175,MRK,14,KJV,these witness against thee
3176,MRK,14,KJV,but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed
3177,MRK,14,KJV,and jesus said
3178,MRK,14,KJV,i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
3179,MRK,14,KJV,then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses
3180,MRK,14,KJV,ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death
3181,MRK,14,KJV,and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands
3182,MRK,14,KJV,and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priest
3183,MRK,14,KJV,and when she saw peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth
3184,MRK,14,KJV,but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew
3185,MRK,14,KJV,and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is
3186,MRK,14,KJV,one
3187,MRK,14,KJV,of them
3188,MRK,14,KJV,and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to peter surely thou art
3189,MRK,14,KJV,one
3190,MRK,14,KJV,of them for thou art a galilaean and thy speech agreeth
3191,MRK,14,KJV,thereto
3192,MRK,14,KJV,
3193,MRK,14,KJV,but he began to curse and to swear
3194,MRK,14,KJV,saying
3195,MRK,14,KJV,i know not this man of whom ye speak
3196,MRK,14,KJV,and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept
3197,MRK,15,KJV,and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound jesus and carried
3198,MRK,15,KJV,him
3199,MRK,15,KJV,away and delivered
3200,MRK,15,KJV,him
3201,MRK,15,KJV,to pilate
3202,MRK,15,KJV,and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering said unto him
3203,MRK,15,KJV,thou sayest
3204,MRK,15,KJV,it
3205,MRK,15,KJV,
3206,MRK,15,KJV,and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered nothing
3207,MRK,15,KJV,and pilate asked him again saying answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee
3208,MRK,15,KJV,but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled
3209,MRK,15,KJV,now at
3210,MRK,15,KJV,that
3211,MRK,15,KJV,feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired
3212,MRK,15,KJV,and there was
3213,MRK,15,KJV,one
3214,MRK,15,KJV,named barabbas
3215,MRK,15,KJV,which lay
3216,MRK,15,KJV,bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection
3217,MRK,15,KJV,and the multitude crying aloud began to desire
3218,MRK,15,KJV,him to do
3219,MRK,15,KJV,as he had ever done unto them
3220,MRK,15,KJV,but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews
3221,MRK,15,KJV,for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy
3222,MRK,15,KJV,but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release barabbas unto them
3223,MRK,15,KJV,and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye then that i shall do
3224,MRK,15,KJV,unto him
3225,MRK,15,KJV,whom ye call the king of the jews
3226,MRK,15,KJV,and they cried out again crucify him
3227,MRK,15,KJV,then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him
3228,MRK,15,KJV,and
3229,MRK,15,KJV,so
3230,MRK,15,KJV,pilate willing to content the people released barabbas unto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged
3231,MRK,15,KJV,him
3232,MRK,15,KJV,to be crucified
3233,MRK,15,KJV,and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetorium and they call together the whole band
3234,MRK,15,KJV,and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his
3235,MRK,15,KJV,head
3236,MRK,15,KJV,
3237,MRK,15,KJV,and began to salute him hail king of the jews
3238,MRK,15,KJV,and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing
3239,MRK,15,KJV,their
3240,MRK,15,KJV,knees worshipped him
3241,MRK,15,KJV,and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him
3242,MRK,15,KJV,and they compel one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross
3243,MRK,15,KJV,and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull
3244,MRK,15,KJV,and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received
3245,MRK,15,KJV,it
3246,MRK,15,KJV,not
3247,MRK,15,KJV,and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should take
3248,MRK,15,KJV,and it was the third hour and they crucified him
3249,MRK,15,KJV,and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews
3250,MRK,15,KJV,and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right hand and the other on his left
3251,MRK,15,KJV,and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was numbered with the transgressors
3252,MRK,15,KJV,and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest
3253,MRK,15,KJV,it
3254,MRK,15,KJV,in three days
3255,MRK,15,KJV,save thyself and come down from the cross
3256,MRK,15,KJV,likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save
3257,MRK,15,KJV,let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him
3258,MRK,15,KJV,and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
3259,MRK,15,KJV,and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying
3260,MRK,15,KJV,eloi eloi lama sabachthani
3261,MRK,15,KJV,which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
3262,MRK,15,KJV,and some of them that stood by when they heard
3263,MRK,15,KJV,it
3264,MRK,15,KJV,said behold he calleth elias
3265,MRK,15,KJV,and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put
3266,MRK,15,KJV,it
3267,MRK,15,KJV,on a reed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whether elias will come to take him down
3268,MRK,15,KJV,and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost
3269,MRK,15,KJV,and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom
3270,MRK,15,KJV,and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god
3271,MRK,15,KJV,there were also women looking on afar off among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome
3272,MRK,15,KJV,who also when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem
3273,MRK,15,KJV,and now when the even was come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath
3274,MRK,15,KJV,joseph of arimathaea an honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus
3275,MRK,15,KJV,and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling
3276,MRK,15,KJV,unto him
3277,MRK,15,KJV,the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead
3278,MRK,15,KJV,and when he knew
3279,MRK,15,KJV,it
3280,MRK,15,KJV,of the centurion he gave the body to joseph
3281,MRK,15,KJV,and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre
3282,MRK,15,KJV,and mary magdalene and mary
3283,MRK,15,KJV,the mother
3284,MRK,15,KJV,of joses beheld where he was laid
3285,MRK,16,KJV,and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the
3286,MRK,16,KJV,mother
3287,MRK,16,KJV,of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him
3288,MRK,16,KJV,and very early in the morning the first
3289,MRK,16,KJV,day
3290,MRK,16,KJV,of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
3291,MRK,16,KJV,and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre
3292,MRK,16,KJV,and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great
3293,MRK,16,KJV,and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted
3294,MRK,16,KJV,and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him
3295,MRK,16,KJV,but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you
3296,MRK,16,KJV,and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any
3297,MRK,16,KJV,man
3298,MRK,16,KJV,for they were afraid
3299,MRK,16,KJV,now when
3300,MRK,16,KJV,jesus
3301,MRK,16,KJV,was risen early the first
3302,MRK,16,KJV,day
3303,MRK,16,KJV,of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils
3304,MRK,16,KJV,and
3305,MRK,16,KJV,she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept
3306,MRK,16,KJV,and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not
3307,MRK,16,KJV,after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country
3308,MRK,16,KJV,and they went and told
3309,MRK,16,KJV,it
3310,MRK,16,KJV,unto the residue neither believed they them
3311,MRK,16,KJV,afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen
3312,MRK,16,KJV,and he said unto them
3313,MRK,16,KJV,go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
3314,MRK,16,KJV,he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
3315,MRK,16,KJV,and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
3316,MRK,16,KJV,they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
3317,MRK,16,KJV,so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god
3318,MRK,16,KJV,and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with
3319,MRK,16,KJV,them
3320,MRK,16,KJV,and confirming the word with signs following amen
3321,LUK,1,KJV,forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
3322,LUK,1,KJV,even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
3323,LUK,1,KJV,it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus
3324,LUK,1,KJV,that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed
3325,LUK,1,KJV,there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife
3326,LUK,1,KJV,was
3327,LUK,1,KJV,of the daughters of aaron and her name
3328,LUK,1,KJV,was
3329,LUK,1,KJV,elisabeth
3330,LUK,1,KJV,and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless
3331,LUK,1,KJV,and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were
3332,LUK,1,KJV,now
3333,LUK,1,KJV,well stricken in years
3334,LUK,1,KJV,and it came to pass that while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his course
3335,LUK,1,KJV,according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord
3336,LUK,1,KJV,and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense
3337,LUK,1,KJV,and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
3338,LUK,1,KJV,and when zacharias saw
3339,LUK,1,KJV,him
3340,LUK,1,KJV,he was troubled and fear fell upon him
3341,LUK,1,KJV,but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john
3342,LUK,1,KJV,and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth
3343,LUK,1,KJV,for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb
3344,LUK,1,KJV,and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god
3345,LUK,1,KJV,and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord
3346,LUK,1,KJV,and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years
3347,LUK,1,KJV,and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidings
3348,LUK,1,KJV,and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season
3349,LUK,1,KJV,and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple
3350,LUK,1,KJV,and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless
3351,LUK,1,KJV,and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house
3352,LUK,1,KJV,and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying
3353,LUK,1,KJV,thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on
3354,LUK,1,KJV,me
3355,LUK,1,KJV,to take away my reproach among men
3356,LUK,1,KJV,and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth
3357,LUK,1,KJV,to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name
3358,LUK,1,KJV,was
3359,LUK,1,KJV,mary
3360,LUK,1,KJV,and the angel came in unto her and said hail
3361,LUK,1,KJV,thou that art
3362,LUK,1,KJV,highly favoured the lord
3363,LUK,1,KJV,is
3364,LUK,1,KJV,with thee blessed
3365,LUK,1,KJV,art
3366,LUK,1,KJV,thou among women
3367,LUK,1,KJV,and when she saw
3368,LUK,1,KJV,him
3369,LUK,1,KJV,she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be
3370,LUK,1,KJV,and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god
3371,LUK,1,KJV,and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus
3372,LUK,1,KJV,he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david
3373,LUK,1,KJV,and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end
3374,LUK,1,KJV,then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man
3375,LUK,1,KJV,and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
3376,LUK,1,KJV,and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren
3377,LUK,1,KJV,for with god nothing shall be impossible
3378,LUK,1,KJV,and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her
3379,LUK,1,KJV,and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of juda
3380,LUK,1,KJV,and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth
3381,LUK,1,KJV,and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost
3382,LUK,1,KJV,and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed
3383,LUK,1,KJV,art
3384,LUK,1,KJV,thou among women and blessed
3385,LUK,1,KJV,is
3386,LUK,1,KJV,the fruit of thy womb
3387,LUK,1,KJV,and whence
3388,LUK,1,KJV,is
3389,LUK,1,KJV,this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me
3390,LUK,1,KJV,for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy
3391,LUK,1,KJV,and blessed
3392,LUK,1,KJV,is
3393,LUK,1,KJV,she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord
3394,LUK,1,KJV,and mary said
3395,LUK,1,KJV,my soul doth magnify the lord
3396,LUK,1,KJV,and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour
3397,LUK,1,KJV,for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden
3398,LUK,1,KJV,for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
3399,LUK,1,KJV,for he that is mighty hath done to me great things
3400,LUK,1,KJV,and holy
3401,LUK,1,KJV,is
3402,LUK,1,KJV,his name
3403,LUK,1,KJV,and his mercy
3404,LUK,1,KJV,is
3405,LUK,1,KJV,on them that fear him
3406,LUK,1,KJV,from generation to generation
3407,LUK,1,KJV,he hath shewed strength with his arm
3408,LUK,1,KJV,he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
3409,LUK,1,KJV,he hath put down the mighty from
3410,LUK,1,KJV,their
3411,LUK,1,KJV,seats
3412,LUK,1,KJV,and exalted them of low degree
3413,LUK,1,KJV,he hath filled the hungry with good things
3414,LUK,1,KJV,and the rich he hath sent empty away
3415,LUK,1,KJV,he hath holpen his servant israel
3416,LUK,1,KJV,in remembrance of
3417,LUK,1,KJV,his
3418,LUK,1,KJV,mercy
3419,LUK,1,KJV,as he spake to our fathers
3420,LUK,1,KJV,to abraham and to his seed for ever
3421,LUK,1,KJV,and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house
3422,LUK,1,KJV,now elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son
3423,LUK,1,KJV,and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her
3424,LUK,1,KJV,and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father
3425,LUK,1,KJV,and his mother answered and said not
3426,LUK,1,KJV,so
3427,LUK,1,KJV,but he shall be called john
3428,LUK,1,KJV,and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name
3429,LUK,1,KJV,and they made signs to his father how he would have him called
3430,LUK,1,KJV,and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john and they marvelled all
3431,LUK,1,KJV,and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue
3432,LUK,1,KJV,loosed
3433,LUK,1,KJV,and he spake and praised god
3434,LUK,1,KJV,and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea
3435,LUK,1,KJV,and all they that heard
3436,LUK,1,KJV,them
3437,LUK,1,KJV,laid
3438,LUK,1,KJV,them
3439,LUK,1,KJV,up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him
3440,LUK,1,KJV,and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying
3441,LUK,1,KJV,blessed
3442,LUK,1,KJV,be
3443,LUK,1,KJV,the lord god of israel
3444,LUK,1,KJV,for he hath visited and redeemed his people
3445,LUK,1,KJV,and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us
3446,LUK,1,KJV,in the house of his servant david
3447,LUK,1,KJV,as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began
3448,LUK,1,KJV,that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us
3449,LUK,1,KJV,to perform the mercy
3450,LUK,1,KJV,promised
3451,LUK,1,KJV,to our fathers
3452,LUK,1,KJV,and to remember his holy covenant
3453,LUK,1,KJV,the oath which he sware to our father abraham
3454,LUK,1,KJV,that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
3455,LUK,1,KJV,might serve him without fear
3456,LUK,1,KJV,in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life
3457,LUK,1,KJV,and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest
3458,LUK,1,KJV,for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways
3459,LUK,1,KJV,to give knowledge of salvation unto his people
3460,LUK,1,KJV,by the remission of their sins
3461,LUK,1,KJV,through the tender mercy of our god
3462,LUK,1,KJV,whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us
3463,LUK,1,KJV,to give light to them that sit in darkness and
3464,LUK,1,KJV,in
3465,LUK,1,KJV,the shadow of death
3466,LUK,1,KJV,to guide our feet into the way of peace
3467,LUK,1,KJV,and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel
3468,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed
3469,LUK,2,KJV,and
3470,LUK,2,KJV,this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria
3471,LUK,2,KJV,and all went to be taxed every one into his own city
3472,LUK,2,KJV,and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david
3473,LUK,2,KJV,to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child
3474,LUK,2,KJV,and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered
3475,LUK,2,KJV,and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn
3476,LUK,2,KJV,and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night
3477,LUK,2,KJV,and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid
3478,LUK,2,KJV,and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people
3479,LUK,2,KJV,for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord
3480,LUK,2,KJV,and this
3481,LUK,2,KJV,shall be
3482,LUK,2,KJV,a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
3483,LUK,2,KJV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying
3484,LUK,2,KJV,glory to god in the highest
3485,LUK,2,KJV,and on earth peace good will toward men
3486,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us
3487,LUK,2,KJV,and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger
3488,LUK,2,KJV,and when they had seen
3489,LUK,2,KJV,it
3490,LUK,2,KJV,they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
3491,LUK,2,KJV,and all they that heard
3492,LUK,2,KJV,it
3493,LUK,2,KJV,wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds
3494,LUK,2,KJV,but mary kept all these things and pondered
3495,LUK,2,KJV,them
3496,LUK,2,KJV,in her heart
3497,LUK,2,KJV,and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them
3498,LUK,2,KJV,and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
3499,LUK,2,KJV,and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present
3500,LUK,2,KJV,him
3501,LUK,2,KJV,to the lord
3502,LUK,2,KJV,as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord
3503,LUK,2,KJV,and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
3504,LUK,2,KJV,and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name
3505,LUK,2,KJV,was
3506,LUK,2,KJV,simeon and the same man
3507,LUK,2,KJV,was
3508,LUK,2,KJV,just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him
3509,LUK,2,KJV,and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ
3510,LUK,2,KJV,and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law
3511,LUK,2,KJV,then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said
3512,LUK,2,KJV,lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace
3513,LUK,2,KJV,according to thy word
3514,LUK,2,KJV,for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
3515,LUK,2,KJV,which thou hast prepared before the face of all people
3516,LUK,2,KJV,a light to lighten the gentiles
3517,LUK,2,KJV,and the glory of thy people israel
3518,LUK,2,KJV,and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
3519,LUK,2,KJV,and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this
3520,LUK,2,KJV,child
3521,LUK,2,KJV,is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against
3522,LUK,2,KJV,yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
3523,LUK,2,KJV,and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity
3524,LUK,2,KJV,and she
3525,LUK,2,KJV,was
3526,LUK,2,KJV,a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served
3527,LUK,2,KJV,god
3528,LUK,2,KJV,with fastings and prayers night and day
3529,LUK,2,KJV,and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem
3530,LUK,2,KJV,and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth
3531,LUK,2,KJV,and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him
3532,LUK,2,KJV,now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover
3533,LUK,2,KJV,and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast
3534,LUK,2,KJV,and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not
3535,LUK,2,KJV,of it
3536,LUK,2,KJV,
3537,LUK,2,KJV,but they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and they sought him among
3538,LUK,2,KJV,their
3539,LUK,2,KJV,kinsfolk and acquaintance
3540,LUK,2,KJV,and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him
3541,LUK,2,KJV,and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions
3542,LUK,2,KJV,and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
3543,LUK,2,KJV,and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing
3544,LUK,2,KJV,and he said unto them
3545,LUK,2,KJV,how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business
3546,LUK,2,KJV,and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them
3547,LUK,2,KJV,and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart
3548,LUK,2,KJV,and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and man
3549,LUK,3,KJV,now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene
3550,LUK,3,KJV,annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness
3551,LUK,3,KJV,and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
3552,LUK,3,KJV,as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying
3553,LUK,3,KJV,the voice of one crying in the wilderness
3554,LUK,3,KJV,prepare ye the way of the lord
3555,LUK,3,KJV,make his paths straight
3556,LUK,3,KJV,every valley shall be filled
3557,LUK,3,KJV,and every mountain and hill shall be brought low
3558,LUK,3,KJV,and the crooked shall be made straight
3559,LUK,3,KJV,and the rough ways
3560,LUK,3,KJV,shall be
3561,LUK,3,KJV,made smooth
3562,LUK,3,KJV,and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
3563,LUK,3,KJV,then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
3564,LUK,3,KJV,bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to
3565,LUK,3,KJV,our
3566,LUK,3,KJV,father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
3567,LUK,3,KJV,and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
3568,LUK,3,KJV,and the people asked him saying what shall we do then
3569,LUK,3,KJV,he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise
3570,LUK,3,KJV,then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do
3571,LUK,3,KJV,and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you
3572,LUK,3,KJV,and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse
3573,LUK,3,KJV,any
3574,LUK,3,KJV,falsely and be content with your wages
3575,LUK,3,KJV,and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not
3576,LUK,3,KJV,john answered saying unto
3577,LUK,3,KJV,them
3578,LUK,3,KJV,all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
3579,LUK,3,KJV,whose fan
3580,LUK,3,KJV,is
3581,LUK,3,KJV,in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable
3582,LUK,3,KJV,and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people
3583,LUK,3,KJV,but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brother philips wife and for all the evils which herod had done
3584,LUK,3,KJV,added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison
3585,LUK,3,KJV,now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened
3586,LUK,3,KJV,and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased
3587,LUK,3,KJV,and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph which was
3588,LUK,3,KJV,the son
3589,LUK,3,KJV,of heli
3590,LUK,3,KJV,which was
3591,LUK,3,KJV,the son
3592,LUK,3,KJV,of matthat which was
3593,LUK,3,KJV,the son
3594,LUK,3,KJV,of levi which was
3595,LUK,3,KJV,the son

3757,LUK,4,KJV,it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god
3758,LUK,4,KJV,and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time

3763,LUK,4,KJV,and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence

3766,LUK,4,KJV,their

3770,LUK,4,KJV,and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season
3771,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about
3772,LUK,4,KJV,and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all
3773,LUK,4,KJV,and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read
3774,LUK,4,KJV,and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written
3775,LUK,4,KJV,the spirit of the lord
3776,LUK,4,KJV,is
3777,LUK,4,KJV,upon me
3778,LUK,4,KJV,because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor
3779,LUK,4,KJV,he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives
3780,LUK,4,KJV,and recovering of sight to the blind
3781,LUK,4,KJV,to set at liberty them that are bruised
3782,LUK,4,KJV,to preach the acceptable year of the lord
3783,LUK,4,KJV,and he closed the book and he gave
3784,LUK,4,KJV,it
3785,LUK,4,KJV,again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him
3786,LUK,4,KJV,and he began to say unto them
3787,LUK,4,KJV,this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
3788,LUK,4,KJV,and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs son
3789,LUK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
3790,LUK,4,KJV,ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country
3791,LUK,4,KJV,and he said
3792,LUK,4,KJV,verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country
3793,LUK,4,KJV,but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land
3794,LUK,4,KJV,but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta
3795,LUK,4,KJV,a city
3796,LUK,4,KJV,of sidon unto a woman
3797,LUK,4,KJV,that was
3798,LUK,4,KJV,a widow
3799,LUK,4,KJV,
3800,LUK,4,KJV,and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian
3801,LUK,4,KJV,and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath
3802,LUK,4,KJV,and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong
3803,LUK,4,KJV,but he passing through the midst of them went his way
3804,LUK,4,KJV,and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days
3805,LUK,4,KJV,and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power
3806,LUK,4,KJV,and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice
3807,LUK,4,KJV,saying let
3808,LUK,4,KJV,us
3809,LUK,4,KJV,alone what have we to do with thee
3810,LUK,4,KJV,thou
3811,LUK,4,KJV,jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
3812,LUK,4,KJV,and jesus rebuked him saying
3813,LUK,4,KJV,hold thy peace and come out of him
3814,LUK,4,KJV,and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not
3815,LUK,4,KJV,and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word
3816,LUK,4,KJV,is
3817,LUK,4,KJV,this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out
3818,LUK,4,KJV,and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about
3819,LUK,4,KJV,and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her
3820,LUK,4,KJV,and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them
3821,LUK,4,KJV,now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them
3822,LUK,4,KJV,and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking
3823,LUK,4,KJV,them
3824,LUK,4,KJV,suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ
3825,LUK,4,KJV,and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them
3826,LUK,4,KJV,and he said unto them
3827,LUK,4,KJV,i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent
3828,LUK,4,KJV,and he preached in the synagogues of galilee
3829,LUK,5,KJV,and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret
3830,LUK,5,KJV,and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing
3831,LUK,5,KJV,their
3832,LUK,5,KJV,nets
3833,LUK,5,KJV,and he entered into one of the ships which was simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship
3834,LUK,5,KJV,now when he had left speaking he said unto simon
3835,LUK,5,KJV,launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught
3836,LUK,5,KJV,and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net
3837,LUK,5,KJV,and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake
3838,LUK,5,KJV,and they beckoned unto
3839,LUK,5,KJV,their
3840,LUK,5,KJV,partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink
3841,LUK,5,KJV,when simon peter saw
3842,LUK,5,KJV,it
3843,LUK,5,KJV,he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord
3844,LUK,5,KJV,for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken
3845,LUK,5,KJV,and so
3846,LUK,5,KJV,was
3847,LUK,5,KJV,also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon
3848,LUK,5,KJV,fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men
3849,LUK,5,KJV,and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him
3850,LUK,5,KJV,and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on
3851,LUK,5,KJV,his
3852,LUK,5,KJV,face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
3853,LUK,5,KJV,and he put forth
3854,LUK,5,KJV,his
3855,LUK,5,KJV,hand and touched him saying
3856,LUK,5,KJV,i will be thou clean
3857,LUK,5,KJV,and immediately the leprosy departed from him
3858,LUK,5,KJV,and he charged him to
3859,LUK,5,KJV,tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them
3860,LUK,5,KJV,but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities
3861,LUK,5,KJV,and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed
3862,LUK,5,KJV,and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was
3863,LUK,5,KJV,present
3864,LUK,5,KJV,to heal them
3865,LUK,5,KJV,and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and they sought
3866,LUK,5,KJV,means
3867,LUK,5,KJV,to bring him in and to lay
3868,LUK,5,KJV,him
3869,LUK,5,KJV,before him
3870,LUK,5,KJV,and when they could not find by what
3871,LUK,5,KJV,way
3872,LUK,5,KJV,they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with
3873,LUK,5,KJV,his
3874,LUK,5,KJV,couch into the midst before jesus
3875,LUK,5,KJV,and when he saw their faith he said unto him
3876,LUK,5,KJV,man thy sins are forgiven thee
3877,LUK,5,KJV,and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
3878,LUK,5,KJV,but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them
3879,LUK,5,KJV,what reason ye in your hearts
3880,LUK,5,KJV,whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk
3881,LUK,5,KJV,but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins
3882,LUK,5,KJV,he said unto the sick of the palsy
3883,LUK,5,KJV,i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house
3884,LUK,5,KJV,and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying god
3885,LUK,5,KJV,and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things to day
3886,LUK,5,KJV,and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him
3887,LUK,5,KJV,follow me
3888,LUK,5,KJV,and he left all rose up and followed him
3889,LUK,5,KJV,and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them
3890,LUK,5,KJV,but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners
3891,LUK,5,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them
3892,LUK,5,KJV,they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick
3893,LUK,5,KJV,i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
3894,LUK,5,KJV,and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise
3895,LUK,5,KJV,the disciples
3896,LUK,5,KJV,of the pharisees but thine eat and drink
3897,LUK,5,KJV,and he said unto them
3898,LUK,5,KJV,can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them
3899,LUK,5,KJV,but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days
3900,LUK,5,KJV,and he spake also a parable unto them
3901,LUK,5,KJV,no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the piece that was
3902,LUK,5,KJV,taken
3903,LUK,5,KJV,out of the new agreeth not with the old
3904,LUK,5,KJV,and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish
3905,LUK,5,KJV,but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved
3906,LUK,5,KJV,no man also having drunk old
3907,LUK,5,KJV,wine
3908,LUK,5,KJV,straightway desireth new for he saith the old is better
3909,LUK,6,KJV,and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing
3910,LUK,6,KJV,them
3911,LUK,6,KJV,in
3912,LUK,6,KJV,their
3913,LUK,6,KJV,hands
3914,LUK,6,KJV,and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days
3915,LUK,6,KJV,and jesus answering them said
3916,LUK,6,KJV,have ye not read so much as this what david did when himself was an hungred and they which were with him
3917,LUK,6,KJV,how he went into the house of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone
3918,LUK,6,KJV,and he said unto them
3919,LUK,6,KJV,that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
3920,LUK,6,KJV,and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was withered
3921,LUK,6,KJV,and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him
3922,LUK,6,KJV,but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand
3923,LUK,6,KJV,rise up and stand forth in the midst
3924,LUK,6,KJV,and he arose and stood forth
3925,LUK,6,KJV,then said jesus unto them
3926,LUK,6,KJV,i will ask you one thing is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy
3927,LUK,6,KJV,it
3928,LUK,6,KJV,and looking round about upon them all he said unto the man
3929,LUK,6,KJV,stretch forth thy hand
3930,LUK,6,KJV,and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other
3931,LUK,6,KJV,and they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to jesus
3932,LUK,6,KJV,and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god
3933,LUK,6,KJV,and when it was day he called
3934,LUK,6,KJV,unto him
3935,LUK,6,KJV,his disciples and of them he chose twelve whom also he named apostles
3936,LUK,6,KJV,simon whom he also named peter and andrew his brother james and john philip and bartholomew
3937,LUK,6,KJV,matthew and thomas james the
3938,LUK,6,KJV,son
3939,LUK,6,KJV,of alphaeus and simon called zelotes
3940,LUK,6,KJV,and judas
3941,LUK,6,KJV,the brother
3942,LUK,6,KJV,of james and judas iscariot which also was the traitor
3943,LUK,6,KJV,and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases
3944,LUK,6,KJV,and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed
3945,LUK,6,KJV,and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed
3946,LUK,6,KJV,them
3947,LUK,6,KJV,all
3948,LUK,6,KJV,and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said
3949,LUK,6,KJV,blessed
3950,LUK,6,KJV,be ye
3951,LUK,6,KJV,poor for yours is the kingdom of god
3952,LUK,6,KJV,blessed

3954,LUK,6,KJV,that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed
3955,LUK,6,KJV,are ye
3956,LUK,6,KJV,that weep now for ye shall laugh
3957,LUK,6,KJV,blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you
3958,LUK,6,KJV,from their company
3959,LUK,6,KJV,and shall reproach
3960,LUK,6,KJV,you
3961,LUK,6,KJV,and cast out your name as evil for the son of mans sake
3962,LUK,6,KJV,rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward
3963,LUK,6,KJV,is
3964,LUK,6,KJV,great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets
3965,LUK,6,KJV,but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation
3966,LUK,6,KJV,woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep
3967,LUK,6,KJV,woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets
3968,LUK,6,KJV,but i say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you
3969,LUK,6,KJV,bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you
3970,LUK,6,KJV,and unto him that smiteth thee on the
3971,LUK,6,KJV,one
3972,LUK,6,KJV,cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not
3973,LUK,6,KJV,to take thy
3974,LUK,6,KJV,coat also
3975,LUK,6,KJV,give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask
3976,LUK,6,KJV,them
3977,LUK,6,KJV,not again
3978,LUK,6,KJV,and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise
3979,LUK,6,KJV,for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love them
3980,LUK,6,KJV,and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinners also do even the same
3981,LUK,6,KJV,and if ye lend
3982,LUK,6,KJV,to them
3983,LUK,6,KJV,of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again
3984,LUK,6,KJV,but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and
3985,LUK,6,KJV,to
3986,LUK,6,KJV,the evil
3987,LUK,6,KJV,be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful
3988,LUK,6,KJV,judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven
3989,LUK,6,KJV,give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again
3990,LUK,6,KJV,and he spake a parable unto them
3991,LUK,6,KJV,can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch
3992,LUK,6,KJV,the disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his master
3993,LUK,6,KJV,and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye
3994,LUK,6,KJV,either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye
3995,LUK,6,KJV,for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
3996,LUK,6,KJV,for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes
3997,LUK,6,KJV,a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh
3998,LUK,6,KJV,and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
3999,LUK,6,KJV,whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them i will shew you to whom he is like
4000,LUK,6,KJV,he is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock
4001,LUK,6,KJV,but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
4002,LUK,7,KJV,now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people he entered into capernaum
4003,LUK,7,KJV,and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die
4004,LUK,7,KJV,and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
4005,LUK,7,KJV,and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this
4006,LUK,7,KJV,for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue
4007,LUK,7,KJV,then jesus went with them
4008,LUK,7,KJV,and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof
4009,LUK,7,KJV,wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed
4010,LUK,7,KJV,for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth
4011,LUK,7,KJV,it
4012,LUK,7,KJV,
4013,LUK,7,KJV,when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him
4014,LUK,7,KJV,i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel
4015,LUK,7,KJV,and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick
4016,LUK,7,KJV,and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people
4017,LUK,7,KJV,now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her
4018,LUK,7,KJV,and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her
4019,LUK,7,KJV,weep not
4020,LUK,7,KJV,and he came and touched the bier and they that bare
4021,LUK,7,KJV,him
4022,LUK,7,KJV,stood still and he said
4023,LUK,7,KJV,young man i say unto thee arise
4024,LUK,7,KJV,and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother
4025,LUK,7,KJV,and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people
4026,LUK,7,KJV,and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about
4027,LUK,7,KJV,and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things
4028,LUK,7,KJV,and john calling
4029,LUK,7,KJV,unto him
4030,LUK,7,KJV,two of his disciples sent
4031,LUK,7,KJV,them
4032,LUK,7,KJV,to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
4033,LUK,7,KJV,when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
4034,LUK,7,KJV,and in that same hour he cured many of
4035,LUK,7,KJV,their
4036,LUK,7,KJV,infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many
4037,LUK,7,KJV,that were
4038,LUK,7,KJV,blind he gave sight
4039,LUK,7,KJV,then jesus answering said unto them
4040,LUK,7,KJV,go your way and tell john what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached
4041,LUK,7,KJV,and blessed is
4042,LUK,7,KJV,he
4043,LUK,7,KJV,whosoever shall not be offended in me
4044,LUK,7,KJV,and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john
4045,LUK,7,KJV,what went ye out into the wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind
4046,LUK,7,KJV,but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts
4047,LUK,7,KJV,but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet
4048,LUK,7,KJV,this is
4049,LUK,7,KJV,he
4050,LUK,7,KJV,of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
4051,LUK,7,KJV,for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
4052,LUK,7,KJV,and all the people that heard
4053,LUK,7,KJV,him
4054,LUK,7,KJV,and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john
4055,LUK,7,KJV,but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves being not baptized of him
4056,LUK,7,KJV,and the lord said
4057,LUK,7,KJV,whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like
4058,LUK,7,KJV,they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept
4059,LUK,7,KJV,for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a devil
4060,LUK,7,KJV,the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
4061,LUK,7,KJV,but wisdom is justified of all her children
4062,LUK,7,KJV,and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meat
4063,LUK,7,KJV,and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that
4064,LUK,7,KJV,jesus
4065,LUK,7,KJV,sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment
4066,LUK,7,KJV,and stood at his feet behind
4067,LUK,7,KJV,him
4068,LUK,7,KJV,weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe
4069,LUK,7,KJV,them
4070,LUK,7,KJV,with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed
4071,LUK,7,KJV,them
4072,LUK,7,KJV,with the ointment
4073,LUK,7,KJV,now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw
4074,LUK,7,KJV,it
4075,LUK,7,KJV,he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman
4076,LUK,7,KJV,this is
4077,LUK,7,KJV,that toucheth him for she is a sinner
4078,LUK,7,KJV,and jesus answering said unto him
4079,LUK,7,KJV,simon i have somewhat to say unto thee
4080,LUK,7,KJV,and he saith master say on
4081,LUK,7,KJV,there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty
4082,LUK,7,KJV,and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most
4083,LUK,7,KJV,simon answered and said i suppose that
4084,LUK,7,KJV,he
4085,LUK,7,KJV,to whom he forgave most and he said unto him
4086,LUK,7,KJV,thou hast rightly judged
4087,LUK,7,KJV,and he turned to the woman and said unto simon
4088,LUK,7,KJV,seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped
4089,LUK,7,KJV,them
4090,LUK,7,KJV,with the hairs of her head
4091,LUK,7,KJV,thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
4092,LUK,7,KJV,my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment
4093,LUK,7,KJV,wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven
4094,LUK,7,KJV,the same
4095,LUK,7,KJV,loveth little
4096,LUK,7,KJV,and he said unto her
4097,LUK,7,KJV,thy sins are forgiven
4098,LUK,7,KJV,and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also
4099,LUK,7,KJV,and he said to the woman
4100,LUK,7,KJV,thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
4101,LUK,8,KJV,and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve
4102,LUK,8,KJV,were
4103,LUK,8,KJV,with him
4104,LUK,8,KJV,and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils
4105,LUK,8,KJV,and joanna the wife of chuza herods steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance
4106,LUK,8,KJV,and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable
4107,LUK,8,KJV,a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it
4108,LUK,8,KJV,and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture
4109,LUK,8,KJV,and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it
4110,LUK,8,KJV,and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold
4111,LUK,8,KJV,and when he had said these things he cried
4112,LUK,8,KJV,he that hath ears to hear let him hear
4113,LUK,8,KJV,and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be
4114,LUK,8,KJV,and he said
4115,LUK,8,KJV,unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand
4116,LUK,8,KJV,now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
4117,LUK,8,KJV,those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved
4118,LUK,8,KJV,they on the rock
4119,LUK,8,KJV,are they
4120,LUK,8,KJV,which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away
4121,LUK,8,KJV,and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of
4122,LUK,8,KJV,this
4123,LUK,8,KJV,life and bring no fruit to perfection
4124,LUK,8,KJV,but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep
4125,LUK,8,KJV,it
4126,LUK,8,KJV,and bring forth fruit with patience
4127,LUK,8,KJV,no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth
4128,LUK,8,KJV,it
4129,LUK,8,KJV,under a bed but setteth
4130,LUK,8,KJV,it
4131,LUK,8,KJV,on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light
4132,LUK,8,KJV,for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither
4133,LUK,8,KJV,any thing
4134,LUK,8,KJV,hid that shall not be known and come abroad
4135,LUK,8,KJV,take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have
4136,LUK,8,KJV,then came to him
4137,LUK,8,KJV,his
4138,LUK,8,KJV,mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the press
4139,LUK,8,KJV,and it was told him
4140,LUK,8,KJV,by certain
4141,LUK,8,KJV,which said thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee
4142,LUK,8,KJV,and he answered and said unto them
4143,LUK,8,KJV,my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it
4144,LUK,8,KJV,now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them
4145,LUK,8,KJV,let us go over unto the other side of the lake
4146,LUK,8,KJV,and they launched forth
4147,LUK,8,KJV,but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled
4148,LUK,8,KJV,with water
4149,LUK,8,KJV,and were in jeopardy
4150,LUK,8,KJV,and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm
4151,LUK,8,KJV,and he said unto them
4152,LUK,8,KJV,where is your faith
4153,LUK,8,KJV,and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him
4154,LUK,8,KJV,and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against galilee
4155,LUK,8,KJV,and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in
4156,LUK,8,KJV,any
4157,LUK,8,KJV,house but in the tombs
4158,LUK,8,KJV,when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus
4159,LUK,8,KJV,thou
4160,LUK,8,KJV,son of god most high i beseech thee torment me not
4161,LUK,8,KJV,for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil into the wilderness
4162,LUK,8,KJV,and jesus asked him saying
4163,LUK,8,KJV,what is thy name
4164,LUK,8,KJV,and he said legion because many devils were entered into him
4165,LUK,8,KJV,and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep
4166,LUK,8,KJV,and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them
4167,LUK,8,KJV,then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked
4168,LUK,8,KJV,when they that fed
4169,LUK,8,KJV,them
4170,LUK,8,KJV,saw what was done they fled and went and told
4171,LUK,8,KJV,it
4172,LUK,8,KJV,in the city and in the country
4173,LUK,8,KJV,then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
4174,LUK,8,KJV,they also which saw
4175,LUK,8,KJV,it
4176,LUK,8,KJV,told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed
4177,LUK,8,KJV,then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again
4178,LUK,8,KJV,now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying
4179,LUK,8,KJV,return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done unto thee
4180,LUK,8,KJV,and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him
4181,LUK,8,KJV,and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people
4182,LUK,8,KJV,gladly
4183,LUK,8,KJV,received him for they were all waiting for him
4184,LUK,8,KJV,and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house
4185,LUK,8,KJV,for he had one only daughter about twelve years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him
4186,LUK,8,KJV,and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any
4187,LUK,8,KJV,came behind
4188,LUK,8,KJV,him
4189,LUK,8,KJV,and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanched
4190,LUK,8,KJV,and jesus said
4191,LUK,8,KJV,who touched me
4192,LUK,8,KJV,when all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press
4193,LUK,8,KJV,thee
4194,LUK,8,KJV,and sayest thou who touched me
4195,LUK,8,KJV,and jesus said
4196,LUK,8,KJV,somebody hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me
4197,LUK,8,KJV,and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately
4198,LUK,8,KJV,and he said unto her
4199,LUK,8,KJV,daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace
4200,LUK,8,KJV,while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues
4201,LUK,8,KJV,house
4202,LUK,8,KJV,saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master
4203,LUK,8,KJV,but when jesus heard
4204,LUK,8,KJV,it
4205,LUK,8,KJV,he answered him saying
4206,LUK,8,KJV,fear not believe only and she shall be made whole
4207,LUK,8,KJV,and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden
4208,LUK,8,KJV,and all wept and bewailed her but he said
4209,LUK,8,KJV,weep not she is not dead but sleepeth
4210,LUK,8,KJV,and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead
4211,LUK,8,KJV,and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying
4212,LUK,8,KJV,maid arise
4213,LUK,8,KJV,and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat
4214,LUK,8,KJV,and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done
4215,LUK,9,KJV,then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases
4216,LUK,9,KJV,and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick
4217,LUK,9,KJV,and he said unto them
4218,LUK,9,KJV,take nothing for
4219,LUK,9,KJV,your
4220,LUK,9,KJV,journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece
4221,LUK,9,KJV,and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart
4222,LUK,9,KJV,and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them
4223,LUK,9,KJV,and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every where
4224,LUK,9,KJV,now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead
4225,LUK,9,KJV,and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again
4226,LUK,9,KJV,and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him
4227,LUK,9,KJV,and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida
4228,LUK,9,KJV,and the people when they knew
4229,LUK,9,KJV,it
4230,LUK,9,KJV,followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing
4231,LUK,9,KJV,and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place
4232,LUK,9,KJV,but he said unto them
4233,LUK,9,KJV,give ye them to eat
4234,LUK,9,KJV,and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people
4235,LUK,9,KJV,for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples
4236,LUK,9,KJV,make them sit down by fifties in a company
4237,LUK,9,KJV,and they did so and made them all sit down
4238,LUK,9,KJV,then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude
4239,LUK,9,KJV,and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
4240,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying
4241,LUK,9,KJV,whom say the people that i am
4242,LUK,9,KJV,they answering said john the baptist but some
4243,LUK,9,KJV,say
4244,LUK,9,KJV,elias and others
4245,LUK,9,KJV,say
4246,LUK,9,KJV,that one of the old prophets is risen again
4247,LUK,9,KJV,he said unto them
4248,LUK,9,KJV,but whom say ye that i am
4249,LUK,9,KJV,peter answering said the christ of god
4250,LUK,9,KJV,and he straitly charged them and commanded
4251,LUK,9,KJV,them
4252,LUK,9,KJV,to tell no man that thing
4253,LUK,9,KJV,saying
4254,LUK,9,KJV,the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day
4255,LUK,9,KJV,and he said to
4256,LUK,9,KJV,them
4257,LUK,9,KJV,all
4258,LUK,9,KJV,if any
4259,LUK,9,KJV,man
4260,LUK,9,KJV,will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
4261,LUK,9,KJV,for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it
4262,LUK,9,KJV,for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away
4263,LUK,9,KJV,for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and
4264,LUK,9,KJV,in his
4265,LUK,9,KJV,fathers and of the holy angels
4266,LUK,9,KJV,but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god
4267,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray
4268,LUK,9,KJV,and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment
4269,LUK,9,KJV,was
4270,LUK,9,KJV,white
4271,LUK,9,KJV,and
4272,LUK,9,KJV,glistering
4273,LUK,9,KJV,and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias
4274,LUK,9,KJV,who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem
4275,LUK,9,KJV,but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him
4276,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said
4277,LUK,9,KJV,while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud
4278,LUK,9,KJV,and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
4279,LUK,9,KJV,and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they kept
4280,LUK,9,KJV,it
4281,LUK,9,KJV,close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen
4282,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him
4283,LUK,9,KJV,and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child
4284,LUK,9,KJV,and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him
4285,LUK,9,KJV,and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not
4286,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus answering said
4287,LUK,9,KJV,o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither
4288,LUK,9,KJV,and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare
4289,LUK,9,KJV,him
4290,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father
4291,LUK,9,KJV,and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples
4292,LUK,9,KJV,let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men
4293,LUK,9,KJV,but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying
4294,LUK,9,KJV,then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest
4295,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him
4296,LUK,9,KJV,and said unto them
4297,LUK,9,KJV,whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great
4298,LUK,9,KJV,and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us
4299,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him
4300,LUK,9,KJV,forbid
4301,LUK,9,KJV,him
4302,LUK,9,KJV,not for he that is not against us is for us
4303,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem
4304,LUK,9,KJV,and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him
4305,LUK,9,KJV,and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem
4306,LUK,9,KJV,and when his disciples james and john saw
4307,LUK,9,KJV,this
4308,LUK,9,KJV,they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did
4309,LUK,9,KJV,but he turned and rebuked them and said
4310,LUK,9,KJV,ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of
4311,LUK,9,KJV,for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save
4312,LUK,9,KJV,them
4313,LUK,9,KJV,and they went to another village
4314,LUK,9,KJV,and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain
4315,LUK,9,KJV,man
4316,LUK,9,KJV,said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
4317,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him
4318,LUK,9,KJV,foxes have holes and birds of the air
4319,LUK,9,KJV,have
4320,LUK,9,KJV,nests but the son of man hath not where to lay
4321,LUK,9,KJV,his
4322,LUK,9,KJV,head
4323,LUK,9,KJV,and he said unto another
4324,LUK,9,KJV,follow me
4325,LUK,9,KJV,but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father
4326,LUK,9,KJV,jesus said unto him
4327,LUK,9,KJV,let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god
4328,LUK,9,KJV,and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house
4329,LUK,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him
4330,LUK,9,KJV,no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
4331,LUK,10,KJV,after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come
4332,LUK,10,KJV,therefore said he unto them
4333,LUK,10,KJV,the harvest truly
4334,LUK,10,KJV,is
4335,LUK,10,KJV,great but the labourers
4336,LUK,10,KJV,are
4337,LUK,10,KJV,few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest
4338,LUK,10,KJV,go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves
4339,LUK,10,KJV,carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by the way
4340,LUK,10,KJV,and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace
4341,LUK,10,KJV,be
4342,LUK,10,KJV,to this house
4343,LUK,10,KJV,and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again
4344,LUK,10,KJV,and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house
4345,LUK,10,KJV,and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you
4346,LUK,10,KJV,and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
4347,LUK,10,KJV,but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say
4348,LUK,10,KJV,even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
4349,LUK,10,KJV,but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city
4350,LUK,10,KJV,woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes
4351,LUK,10,KJV,but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you
4352,LUK,10,KJV,and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell
4353,LUK,10,KJV,he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
4354,LUK,10,KJV,and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name
4355,LUK,10,KJV,and he said unto them
4356,LUK,10,KJV,i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven
4357,LUK,10,KJV,behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you
4358,LUK,10,KJV,notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven
4359,LUK,10,KJV,in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said
4360,LUK,10,KJV,i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
4361,LUK,10,KJV,all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and
4362,LUK,10,KJV,he
4363,LUK,10,KJV,to whom the son will reveal
4364,LUK,10,KJV,him
4365,LUK,10,KJV,and he turned him unto
4366,LUK,10,KJV,his
4367,LUK,10,KJV,disciples and said privately
4368,LUK,10,KJV,blessed
4369,LUK,10,KJV,are
4370,LUK,10,KJV,the eyes which see the things that ye see
4371,LUK,10,KJV,for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen
4372,LUK,10,KJV,them
4373,LUK,10,KJV,and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard
4374,LUK,10,KJV,them
4375,LUK,10,KJV,and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
4376,LUK,10,KJV,he said unto him
4377,LUK,10,KJV,what is written in the law how readest thou
4378,LUK,10,KJV,and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself
4379,LUK,10,KJV,and he said unto him
4380,LUK,10,KJV,thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live
4381,LUK,10,KJV,but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbour
4382,LUK,10,KJV,and jesus answering said
4383,LUK,10,KJV,a certain
4384,LUK,10,KJV,man
4385,LUK,10,KJV,went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded
4386,LUK,10,KJV,him
4387,LUK,10,KJV,and departed leaving
4388,LUK,10,KJV,him
4389,LUK,10,KJV,half dead
4390,LUK,10,KJV,and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
4391,LUK,10,KJV,and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked
4392,LUK,10,KJV,on him
4393,LUK,10,KJV,and passed by on the other side
4394,LUK,10,KJV,but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion
4395,LUK,10,KJV,on him
4396,LUK,10,KJV,and went to
4397,LUK,10,KJV,him
4398,LUK,10,KJV,and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
4399,LUK,10,KJV,and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave
4400,LUK,10,KJV,them
4401,LUK,10,KJV,to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee
4402,LUK,10,KJV,which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves
4403,LUK,10,KJV,and he said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him
4404,LUK,10,KJV,go and do thou likewise
4405,LUK,10,KJV,now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house
4406,LUK,10,KJV,and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word
4407,LUK,10,KJV,but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me
4408,LUK,10,KJV,and jesus answered and said unto her
4409,LUK,10,KJV,martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things
4410,LUK,10,KJV,but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her
4411,LUK,11,KJV,and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples
4412,LUK,11,KJV,and he said unto them
4413,LUK,11,KJV,when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth
4414,LUK,11,KJV,give us day by day our daily bread
4415,LUK,11,KJV,and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
4416,LUK,11,KJV,and he said unto them
4417,LUK,11,KJV,which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves
4418,LUK,11,KJV,for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i have nothing to set before him
4419,LUK,11,KJV,and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee
4420,LUK,11,KJV,i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth
4421,LUK,11,KJV,and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
4422,LUK,11,KJV,for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
4423,LUK,11,KJV,if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if
4424,LUK,11,KJV,he ask
4425,LUK,11,KJV,a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent
4426,LUK,11,KJV,or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion
4427,LUK,11,KJV,if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall
4428,LUK,11,KJV,your
4429,LUK,11,KJV,heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him
4430,LUK,11,KJV,and he was casting out a devil and it was dumb and it came to pass when the devil was gone out the dumb spake and the people wondered
4431,LUK,11,KJV,but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils
4432,LUK,11,KJV,and others tempting
4433,LUK,11,KJV,him
4434,LUK,11,KJV,sought of him a sign from heaven
4435,LUK,11,KJV,but he knowing their thoughts said unto them
4436,LUK,11,KJV,every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house
4437,LUK,11,KJV,divided
4438,LUK,11,KJV,against an house falleth
4439,LUK,11,KJV,if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub
4440,LUK,11,KJV,and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast
4441,LUK,11,KJV,them
4442,LUK,11,KJV,out therefore shall they be your judges
4443,LUK,11,KJV,but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you
4444,LUK,11,KJV,when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peace
4445,LUK,11,KJV,but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils
4446,LUK,11,KJV,he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
4447,LUK,11,KJV,when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will return unto my house whence i came out
4448,LUK,11,KJV,and when he cometh he findeth
4449,LUK,11,KJV,it
4450,LUK,11,KJV,swept and garnished
4451,LUK,11,KJV,then goeth he and taketh
4452,LUK,11,KJV,to him
4453,LUK,11,KJV,seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last
4454,LUK,11,KJV,state
4455,LUK,11,KJV,of that man is worse than the first
4456,LUK,11,KJV,and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed
4457,LUK,11,KJV,is
4458,LUK,11,KJV,the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked
4459,LUK,11,KJV,but he said
4460,LUK,11,KJV,yea rather blessed
4461,LUK,11,KJV,are
4462,LUK,11,KJV,they that hear the word of god and keep it
4463,LUK,11,KJV,and when the people were gathered thick together he began to say
4464,LUK,11,KJV,this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet
4465,LUK,11,KJV,for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation
4466,LUK,11,KJV,the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon
4467,LUK,11,KJV,is
4468,LUK,11,KJV,here
4469,LUK,11,KJV,the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas
4470,LUK,11,KJV,is
4471,LUK,11,KJV,here
4472,LUK,11,KJV,no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth
4473,LUK,11,KJV,it
4474,LUK,11,KJV,in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light
4475,LUK,11,KJV,the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when
4476,LUK,11,KJV,thine eye
4477,LUK,11,KJV,is evil thy body also
4478,LUK,11,KJV,is
4479,LUK,11,KJV,full of darkness
4480,LUK,11,KJV,take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness
4481,LUK,11,KJV,if thy whole body therefore
4482,LUK,11,KJV,be
4483,LUK,11,KJV,full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light
4484,LUK,11,KJV,and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat
4485,LUK,11,KJV,and when the pharisee saw
4486,LUK,11,KJV,it
4487,LUK,11,KJV,he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner
4488,LUK,11,KJV,and the lord said unto him
4489,LUK,11,KJV,now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness
4490,LUK,11,KJV,ye
4491,LUK,11,KJV,fools did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also
4492,LUK,11,KJV,but rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto you
4493,LUK,11,KJV,but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
4494,LUK,11,KJV,woe unto you pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets
4495,LUK,11,KJV,woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over
4496,LUK,11,KJV,them
4497,LUK,11,KJV,are not aware
4498,LUK,11,KJV,of them
4499,LUK,11,KJV,then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master thus saying thou reproachest us also
4500,LUK,11,KJV,and he said
4501,LUK,11,KJV,woe unto you also
4502,LUK,11,KJV,ye
4503,LUK,11,KJV,lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers
4504,LUK,11,KJV,woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them
4505,LUK,11,KJV,truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers for they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres
4506,LUK,11,KJV,therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and
4507,LUK,11,KJV,some
4508,LUK,11,KJV,of them they shall slay and persecute
4509,LUK,11,KJV,that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation
4510,LUK,11,KJV,from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple verily i say unto you it shall be required of this generation
4511,LUK,11,KJV,woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered
4512,LUK,11,KJV,and as he said these things unto them the scribes and the pharisees began to urge
4513,LUK,11,KJV,him
4514,LUK,11,KJV,vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things
4515,LUK,11,KJV,laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him
4516,LUK,12,KJV,in the mean time when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all
4517,LUK,12,KJV,beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
4518,LUK,12,KJV,for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known
4519,LUK,12,KJV,therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops
4520,LUK,12,KJV,and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do
4521,LUK,12,KJV,but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him
4522,LUK,12,KJV,are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god
4523,LUK,12,KJV,but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
4524,LUK,12,KJV,also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god
4525,LUK,12,KJV,but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god
4526,LUK,12,KJV,and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven
4527,LUK,12,KJV,and when they bring you unto the synagogues and
4528,LUK,12,KJV,unto
4529,LUK,12,KJV,magistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say
4530,LUK,12,KJV,for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say
4531,LUK,12,KJV,and one of the company said unto him master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me
4532,LUK,12,KJV,and he said unto him
4533,LUK,12,KJV,man who made me a judge or a divider over you
4534,LUK,12,KJV,and he said unto them
4535,LUK,12,KJV,take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth
4536,LUK,12,KJV,and he spake a parable unto them saying
4537,LUK,12,KJV,the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully
4538,LUK,12,KJV,and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits
4539,LUK,12,KJV,and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods
4540,LUK,12,KJV,and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink
4541,LUK,12,KJV,and
4542,LUK,12,KJV,be merry
4543,LUK,12,KJV,but god said unto him
4544,LUK,12,KJV,thou
4545,LUK,12,KJV,fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided
4546,LUK,12,KJV,so
4547,LUK,12,KJV,is
4548,LUK,12,KJV,he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
4549,LUK,12,KJV,and he said unto his disciples
4550,LUK,12,KJV,therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put on
4551,LUK,12,KJV,the life is more than meat and the body
4552,LUK,12,KJV,is more
4553,LUK,12,KJV,than raiment
4554,LUK,12,KJV,consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowls
4555,LUK,12,KJV,and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit
4556,LUK,12,KJV,if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest
4557,LUK,12,KJV,consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
4558,LUK,12,KJV,if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more
4559,LUK,12,KJV,will he clothe
4560,LUK,12,KJV,you o ye of little faith
4561,LUK,12,KJV,and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind
4562,LUK,12,KJV,for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things
4563,LUK,12,KJV,but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you
4564,LUK,12,KJV,fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
4565,LUK,12,KJV,sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth
4566,LUK,12,KJV,for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
4567,LUK,12,KJV,let your loins be girded about and
4568,LUK,12,KJV,your
4569,LUK,12,KJV,lights burning
4570,LUK,12,KJV,and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately
4571,LUK,12,KJV,blessed
4572,LUK,12,KJV,are
4573,LUK,12,KJV,those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them
4574,LUK,12,KJV,and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find
4575,LUK,12,KJV,them
4576,LUK,12,KJV,so blessed are those servants
4577,LUK,12,KJV,and this know that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through
4578,LUK,12,KJV,be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not
4579,LUK,12,KJV,then peter said unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all
4580,LUK,12,KJV,and the lord said
4581,LUK,12,KJV,who then is that faithful and wise steward whom
4582,LUK,12,KJV,his
4583,LUK,12,KJV,lord shall make ruler over his household to give
4584,LUK,12,KJV,them their
4585,LUK,12,KJV,portion of meat in due season
4586,LUK,12,KJV,blessed
4587,LUK,12,KJV,is
4588,LUK,12,KJV,that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
4589,LUK,12,KJV,of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath
4590,LUK,12,KJV,but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken
4591,LUK,12,KJV,the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for
4592,LUK,12,KJV,him
4593,LUK,12,KJV,and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
4594,LUK,12,KJV,and that servant which knew his lords will and prepared not
4595,LUK,12,KJV,himself
4596,LUK,12,KJV,neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many
4597,LUK,12,KJV,stripes
4598,LUK,12,KJV,but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few
4599,LUK,12,KJV,stripes
4600,LUK,12,KJV,for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more
4601,LUK,12,KJV,i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be already kindled
4602,LUK,12,KJV,but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished
4603,LUK,12,KJV,suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division
4604,LUK,12,KJV,for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three
4605,LUK,12,KJV,the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in law
4606,LUK,12,KJV,and he said also to the people
4607,LUK,12,KJV,when ye see a cloud rise out of the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is
4608,LUK,12,KJV,and when
4609,LUK,12,KJV,ye see
4610,LUK,12,KJV,the south wind blow ye say there will be heat and it cometh to pass
4611,LUK,12,KJV,ye
4612,LUK,12,KJV,hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time
4613,LUK,12,KJV,yea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right
4614,LUK,12,KJV,when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate
4615,LUK,12,KJV,as thou art
4616,LUK,12,KJV,in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison
4617,LUK,12,KJV,i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite
4618,LUK,13,KJV,there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
4619,LUK,13,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them
4620,LUK,13,KJV,suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things
4621,LUK,13,KJV,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
4622,LUK,13,KJV,or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem
4623,LUK,13,KJV,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
4624,LUK,13,KJV,he spake also this parable
4625,LUK,13,KJV,a certain
4626,LUK,13,KJV,man
4627,LUK,13,KJV,had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none
4628,LUK,13,KJV,then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground
4629,LUK,13,KJV,and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung
4630,LUK,13,KJV,it
4631,LUK,13,KJV,and if it bear fruit
4632,LUK,13,KJV,well
4633,LUK,13,KJV,and if not
4634,LUK,13,KJV,then
4635,LUK,13,KJV,after that thou shalt cut it down
4636,LUK,13,KJV,and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
4637,LUK,13,KJV,and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up
4638,LUK,13,KJV,herself
4639,LUK,13,KJV,
4640,LUK,13,KJV,and when jesus saw her he called
4641,LUK,13,KJV,her to him
4642,LUK,13,KJV,and said unto her
4643,LUK,13,KJV,woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity
4644,LUK,13,KJV,and he laid
4645,LUK,13,KJV,his
4646,LUK,13,KJV,hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god
4647,LUK,13,KJV,and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day
4648,LUK,13,KJV,the lord then answered him and said
4649,LUK,13,KJV,thou
4650,LUK,13,KJV,hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or
4651,LUK,13,KJV,his
4652,LUK,13,KJV,ass from the stall and lead
4653,LUK,13,KJV,him
4654,LUK,13,KJV,away to watering
4655,LUK,13,KJV,and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day
4656,LUK,13,KJV,and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him
4657,LUK,13,KJV,then said he
4658,LUK,13,KJV,unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i resemble it
4659,LUK,13,KJV,it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it
4660,LUK,13,KJV,and again he said
4661,LUK,13,KJV,whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god
4662,LUK,13,KJV,it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
4663,LUK,13,KJV,and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem
4664,LUK,13,KJV,then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them
4665,LUK,13,KJV,strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
4666,LUK,13,KJV,when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are
4667,LUK,13,KJV,then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets
4668,LUK,13,KJV,but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all
4669,LUK,13,KJV,ye
4670,LUK,13,KJV,workers of iniquity
4671,LUK,13,KJV,there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you
4672,LUK,13,KJV,yourselves
4673,LUK,13,KJV,thrust out
4674,LUK,13,KJV,and they shall come from the east and
4675,LUK,13,KJV,from
4676,LUK,13,KJV,the west and from the north and
4677,LUK,13,KJV,from
4678,LUK,13,KJV,the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god
4679,LUK,13,KJV,and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last
4680,LUK,13,KJV,the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee
4681,LUK,13,KJV,and he said unto them
4682,LUK,13,KJV,go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third
4683,LUK,13,KJV,day
4684,LUK,13,KJV,i shall be perfected
4685,LUK,13,KJV,nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the
4686,LUK,13,KJV,day
4687,LUK,13,KJV,following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem
4688,LUK,13,KJV,o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen
4689,LUK,13,KJV,doth gather
4690,LUK,13,KJV,her brood under
4691,LUK,13,KJV,her
4692,LUK,13,KJV,wings and ye would not
4693,LUK,13,KJV,behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until
4694,LUK,13,KJV,the time
4695,LUK,13,KJV,come when ye shall say blessed
4696,LUK,13,KJV,is
4697,LUK,13,KJV,he that cometh in the name of the lord
4698,LUK,14,KJV,and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him
4699,LUK,14,KJV,and behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy
4700,LUK,14,KJV,and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying
4701,LUK,14,KJV,is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day
4702,LUK,14,KJV,and they held their peace and he took
4703,LUK,14,KJV,him
4704,LUK,14,KJV,and healed him and let him go
4705,LUK,14,KJV,and answered them saying
4706,LUK,14,KJV,which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day
4707,LUK,14,KJV,and they could not answer him again to these things
4708,LUK,14,KJV,and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them
4709,LUK,14,KJV,when thou art bidden of any
4710,LUK,14,KJV,man
4711,LUK,14,KJV,to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him
4712,LUK,14,KJV,and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room
4713,LUK,14,KJV,but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee
4714,LUK,14,KJV,for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
4715,LUK,14,KJV,then said he also to him that bade him
4716,LUK,14,KJV,when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor
4717,LUK,14,KJV,thy
4718,LUK,14,KJV,rich neighbours lest they also bid thee again and a recompence be made thee
4719,LUK,14,KJV,but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blind
4720,LUK,14,KJV,and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just
4721,LUK,14,KJV,and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed
4722,LUK,14,KJV,is
4723,LUK,14,KJV,he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god
4724,LUK,14,KJV,then said he unto him
4725,LUK,14,KJV,a certain man made a great supper and bade many
4726,LUK,14,KJV,and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready
4727,LUK,14,KJV,and they all with one
4728,LUK,14,KJV,consent
4729,LUK,14,KJV,began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused
4730,LUK,14,KJV,and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused
4731,LUK,14,KJV,and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come
4732,LUK,14,KJV,so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind
4733,LUK,14,KJV,and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room
4734,LUK,14,KJV,and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel
4735,LUK,14,KJV,them
4736,LUK,14,KJV,to come in that my house may be filled
4737,LUK,14,KJV,for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper
4738,LUK,14,KJV,and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them
4739,LUK,14,KJV,if any
4740,LUK,14,KJV,man
4741,LUK,14,KJV,come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
4742,LUK,14,KJV,and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
4743,LUK,14,KJV,for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have
4744,LUK,14,KJV,sufficient
4745,LUK,14,KJV,to finish
4746,LUK,14,KJV,it
4747,LUK,14,KJV,lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish
4748,LUK,14,KJV,it
4749,LUK,14,KJV,all that behold
4750,LUK,14,KJV,it
4751,LUK,14,KJV,begin to mock him
4752,LUK,14,KJV,saying this man began to build and was not able to finish
4753,LUK,14,KJV,or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand
4754,LUK,14,KJV,or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of peace
4755,LUK,14,KJV,
4756,LUK,14,KJV,so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
4757,LUK,14,KJV,salt
4758,LUK,14,KJV,is
4759,LUK,14,KJV,good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned
4760,LUK,14,KJV,it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill
4761,LUK,14,KJV,but
4762,LUK,14,KJV,men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear
4763,LUK,15,KJV,then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him
4764,LUK,15,KJV,and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them
4765,LUK,15,KJV,and he spake this parable unto them saying
4766,LUK,15,KJV,what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it
4767,LUK,15,KJV,and when he hath found
4768,LUK,15,KJV,it
4769,LUK,15,KJV,he layeth
4770,LUK,15,KJV,it
4771,LUK,15,KJV,on his shoulders rejoicing
4772,LUK,15,KJV,and when he cometh home he calleth together
4773,LUK,15,KJV,his
4774,LUK,15,KJV,friends and neighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost
4775,LUK,15,KJV,i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance
4776,LUK,15,KJV,either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find
4777,LUK,15,KJV,it
4778,LUK,15,KJV,and when she hath found
4779,LUK,15,KJV,it
4780,LUK,15,KJV,she calleth
4781,LUK,15,KJV,her
4782,LUK,15,KJV,friends and
4783,LUK,15,KJV,her
4784,LUK,15,KJV,neighbours together saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost
4785,LUK,15,KJV,likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth
4786,LUK,15,KJV,and he said
4787,LUK,15,KJV,a certain man had two sons
4788,LUK,15,KJV,and the younger of them said to
4789,LUK,15,KJV,his
4790,LUK,15,KJV,father father give me the portion of goods that falleth
4791,LUK,15,KJV,to me
4792,LUK,15,KJV,and he divided unto them
4793,LUK,15,KJV,his
4794,LUK,15,KJV,living
4795,LUK,15,KJV,and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living
4796,LUK,15,KJV,and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want
4797,LUK,15,KJV,and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine
4798,LUK,15,KJV,and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him
4799,LUK,15,KJV,and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger
4800,LUK,15,KJV,i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee
4801,LUK,15,KJV,and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants
4802,LUK,15,KJV,and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
4803,LUK,15,KJV,and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
4804,LUK,15,KJV,but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put
4805,LUK,15,KJV,it
4806,LUK,15,KJV,on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on
4807,LUK,15,KJV,his
4808,LUK,15,KJV,feet
4809,LUK,15,KJV,and bring hither the fatted calf and kill
4810,LUK,15,KJV,it
4811,LUK,15,KJV,and let us eat and be merry
4812,LUK,15,KJV,for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry
4813,LUK,15,KJV,now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancing
4814,LUK,15,KJV,and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant
4815,LUK,15,KJV,and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound
4816,LUK,15,KJV,and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him
4817,LUK,15,KJV,and he answering said to
4818,LUK,15,KJV,his
4819,LUK,15,KJV,father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends
4820,LUK,15,KJV,but as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf
4821,LUK,15,KJV,and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine
4822,LUK,15,KJV,it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found
4823,LUK,16,KJV,and he said also unto his disciples
4824,LUK,16,KJV,there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods
4825,LUK,16,KJV,and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward
4826,LUK,16,KJV,then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed
4827,LUK,16,KJV,i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses
4828,LUK,16,KJV,so he called every one of his lords debtors
4829,LUK,16,KJV,unto him
4830,LUK,16,KJV,and said unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord
4831,LUK,16,KJV,and he said an hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty
4832,LUK,16,KJV,then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said an hundred measures of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill and write fourscore
4833,LUK,16,KJV,and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light
4834,LUK,16,KJV,and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations
4835,LUK,16,KJV,he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much
4836,LUK,16,KJV,if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true
4837,LUK,16,KJV,riches
4838,LUK,16,KJV,and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall give you that which is your own
4839,LUK,16,KJV,no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
4840,LUK,16,KJV,and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him
4841,LUK,16,KJV,and he said unto them
4842,LUK,16,KJV,ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
4843,LUK,16,KJV,the law and the prophets
4844,LUK,16,KJV,were
4845,LUK,16,KJV,until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it
4846,LUK,16,KJV,and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail
4847,LUK,16,KJV,whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from
4848,LUK,16,KJV,her
4849,LUK,16,KJV,husband committeth adultery
4850,LUK,16,KJV,there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day
4851,LUK,16,KJV,and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores
4852,LUK,16,KJV,and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores
4853,LUK,16,KJV,and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried
4854,LUK,16,KJV,and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom
4855,LUK,16,KJV,and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
4856,LUK,16,KJV,but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented
4857,LUK,16,KJV,and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that
4858,LUK,16,KJV,would come
4859,LUK,16,KJV,from thence
4860,LUK,16,KJV,then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house
4861,LUK,16,KJV,for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment
4862,LUK,16,KJV,abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
4863,LUK,16,KJV,and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent
4864,LUK,16,KJV,and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead
4865,LUK,17,KJV,then said he unto the disciples
4866,LUK,17,KJV,it is impossible but that offences will come but woe
4867,LUK,17,KJV,unto him
4868,LUK,17,KJV,through whom they come
4869,LUK,17,KJV,it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones
4870,LUK,17,KJV,take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
4871,LUK,17,KJV,and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him
4872,LUK,17,KJV,and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith
4873,LUK,17,KJV,and the lord said
4874,LUK,17,KJV,if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you
4875,LUK,17,KJV,but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat
4876,LUK,17,KJV,and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink
4877,LUK,17,KJV,doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him i trow not
4878,LUK,17,KJV,so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do
4879,LUK,17,KJV,and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee
4880,LUK,17,KJV,and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off
4881,LUK,17,KJV,and they lifted up
4882,LUK,17,KJV,their
4883,LUK,17,KJV,voices and said jesus master have mercy on us
4884,LUK,17,KJV,and when he saw
4885,LUK,17,KJV,them
4886,LUK,17,KJV,he said unto them
4887,LUK,17,KJV,go shew yourselves unto the priests
4888,LUK,17,KJV,and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed
4889,LUK,17,KJV,and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god
4890,LUK,17,KJV,and fell down on
4891,LUK,17,KJV,his
4892,LUK,17,KJV,face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan
4893,LUK,17,KJV,and jesus answering said
4894,LUK,17,KJV,were there not ten cleansed but where
4895,LUK,17,KJV,are
4896,LUK,17,KJV,the nine
4897,LUK,17,KJV,there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger
4898,LUK,17,KJV,
4899,LUK,17,KJV,and he said unto him
4900,LUK,17,KJV,arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole
4901,LUK,17,KJV,and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said
4902,LUK,17,KJV,the kingdom of god cometh not with observation
4903,LUK,17,KJV,neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you
4904,LUK,17,KJV,and he said unto the disciples
4905,LUK,17,KJV,the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see
4906,LUK,17,KJV,it
4907,LUK,17,KJV,and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after
4908,LUK,17,KJV,them
4909,LUK,17,KJV,nor follow
4910,LUK,17,KJV,them
4911,LUK,17,KJV,for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one
4912,LUK,17,KJV,part
4913,LUK,17,KJV,under heaven shineth unto the other
4914,LUK,17,KJV,part
4915,LUK,17,KJV,under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day
4916,LUK,17,KJV,but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation
4917,LUK,17,KJV,and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man
4918,LUK,17,KJV,they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all
4919,LUK,17,KJV,likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded
4920,LUK,17,KJV,but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed
4921,LUK,17,KJV,them
4922,LUK,17,KJV,all
4923,LUK,17,KJV,even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
4924,LUK,17,KJV,in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back
4925,LUK,17,KJV,remember lots wife
4926,LUK,17,KJV,whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it
4927,LUK,17,KJV,i tell you in that night there shall be two
4928,LUK,17,KJV,men
4929,LUK,17,KJV,in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left
4930,LUK,17,KJV,two
4931,LUK,17,KJV,women
4932,LUK,17,KJV,shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left
4933,LUK,17,KJV,two
4934,LUK,17,KJV,men
4935,LUK,17,KJV,shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left
4936,LUK,17,KJV,and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them
4937,LUK,17,KJV,wheresoever the body
4938,LUK,17,KJV,is
4939,LUK,17,KJV,thither will the eagles be gathered together
4940,LUK,18,KJV,and he spake a parable unto them
4941,LUK,18,KJV,to this end
4942,LUK,18,KJV,that men ought always to pray and not to faint
4943,LUK,18,KJV,saying
4944,LUK,18,KJV,there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man
4945,LUK,18,KJV,and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary
4946,LUK,18,KJV,and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man
4947,LUK,18,KJV,yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me
4948,LUK,18,KJV,and the lord said
4949,LUK,18,KJV,hear what the unjust judge saith
4950,LUK,18,KJV,and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them
4951,LUK,18,KJV,i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
4952,LUK,18,KJV,and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others
4953,LUK,18,KJV,two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican
4954,LUK,18,KJV,the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men
4955,LUK,18,KJV,are
4956,LUK,18,KJV,extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican
4957,LUK,18,KJV,i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess
4958,LUK,18,KJV,and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as
4959,LUK,18,KJV,his
4960,LUK,18,KJV,eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner
4961,LUK,18,KJV,i tell you this man went down to his house justified
4962,LUK,18,KJV,rather
4963,LUK,18,KJV,than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
4964,LUK,18,KJV,and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when
4965,LUK,18,KJV,his
4966,LUK,18,KJV,disciples saw
4967,LUK,18,KJV,it
4968,LUK,18,KJV,they rebuked them
4969,LUK,18,KJV,but jesus called them
4970,LUK,18,KJV,unto him
4971,LUK,18,KJV,and said
4972,LUK,18,KJV,suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
4973,LUK,18,KJV,verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein
4974,LUK,18,KJV,and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
4975,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus said unto him
4976,LUK,18,KJV,why callest thou me good none
4977,LUK,18,KJV,is
4978,LUK,18,KJV,good save one
4979,LUK,18,KJV,that is
4980,LUK,18,KJV,god
4981,LUK,18,KJV,thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother
4982,LUK,18,KJV,and he said all these have i kept from my youth up
4983,LUK,18,KJV,now when jesus heard these things he said unto him
4984,LUK,18,KJV,yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
4985,LUK,18,KJV,and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich
4986,LUK,18,KJV,and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said
4987,LUK,18,KJV,how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
4988,LUK,18,KJV,for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
4989,LUK,18,KJV,and they that heard
4990,LUK,18,KJV,it
4991,LUK,18,KJV,said who then can be saved
4992,LUK,18,KJV,and he said
4993,LUK,18,KJV,the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
4994,LUK,18,KJV,then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee
4995,LUK,18,KJV,and he said unto them
4996,LUK,18,KJV,verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake
4997,LUK,18,KJV,who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting
4998,LUK,18,KJV,then he took
4999,LUK,18,KJV,unto him
5000,LUK,18,KJV,the twelve and said unto them
5001,LUK,18,KJV,behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished
5002,LUK,18,KJV,for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on
5003,LUK,18,KJV,and they shall scourge
5004,LUK,18,KJV,him
5005,LUK,18,KJV,and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again
5006,LUK,18,KJV,and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken
5007,LUK,18,KJV,and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging
5008,LUK,18,KJV,and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant
5009,LUK,18,KJV,and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by
5010,LUK,18,KJV,and he cried saying jesus
5011,LUK,18,KJV,thou
5012,LUK,18,KJV,son of david have mercy on me
5013,LUK,18,KJV,and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more
5014,LUK,18,KJV,thou
5015,LUK,18,KJV,son of david have mercy on me
5016,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him
5017,LUK,18,KJV,saying
5018,LUK,18,KJV,what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee
5019,LUK,18,KJV,and he said lord that i may receive my sight
5020,LUK,18,KJV,and jesus said unto him
5021,LUK,18,KJV,receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee
5022,LUK,18,KJV,and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw
5023,LUK,18,KJV,it
5024,LUK,18,KJV,gave praise unto god
5025,LUK,19,KJV,and
5026,LUK,19,KJV,jesus
5027,LUK,19,KJV,entered and passed through jericho
5028,LUK,19,KJV,and behold
5029,LUK,19,KJV,there was
5030,LUK,19,KJV,a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich
5031,LUK,19,KJV,and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature
5032,LUK,19,KJV,and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that
5033,LUK,19,KJV,way
5034,LUK,19,KJV,and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him
5035,LUK,19,KJV,zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house
5036,LUK,19,KJV,and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully
5037,LUK,19,KJV,and when they saw
5038,LUK,19,KJV,it
5039,LUK,19,KJV,they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner
5040,LUK,19,KJV,and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation i restore
5041,LUK,19,KJV,him
5042,LUK,19,KJV,fourfold
5043,LUK,19,KJV,and jesus said unto him
5044,LUK,19,KJV,this day is salvation come to this house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham
5045,LUK,19,KJV,for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
5046,LUK,19,KJV,and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear
5047,LUK,19,KJV,he said therefore
5048,LUK,19,KJV,a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return
5049,LUK,19,KJV,and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come
5050,LUK,19,KJV,but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this
5051,LUK,19,KJV,man
5052,LUK,19,KJV,to reign over us
5053,LUK,19,KJV,and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading
5054,LUK,19,KJV,then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds
5055,LUK,19,KJV,and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities
5056,LUK,19,KJV,and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds
5057,LUK,19,KJV,and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities
5058,LUK,19,KJV,and another came saying lord behold
5059,LUK,19,KJV,here is
5060,LUK,19,KJV,thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin
5061,LUK,19,KJV,for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow
5062,LUK,19,KJV,and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee
5063,LUK,19,KJV,thou
5064,LUK,19,KJV,wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow
5065,LUK,19,KJV,wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury
5066,LUK,19,KJV,and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give
5067,LUK,19,KJV,it
5068,LUK,19,KJV,to him that hath ten pounds
5069,LUK,19,KJV,and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds
5070,LUK,19,KJV,for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him
5071,LUK,19,KJV,but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay
5072,LUK,19,KJV,them
5073,LUK,19,KJV,before me
5074,LUK,19,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem
5075,LUK,19,KJV,and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called
5076,LUK,19,KJV,the mount
5077,LUK,19,KJV,of olives he sent two of his disciples
5078,LUK,19,KJV,saying
5079,LUK,19,KJV,go ye into the village over against
5080,LUK,19,KJV,you
5081,LUK,19,KJV,in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring
5082,LUK,19,KJV,him hither
5083,LUK,19,KJV,and if any man ask you why do ye loose
5084,LUK,19,KJV,him
5085,LUK,19,KJV,thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him
5086,LUK,19,KJV,and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them
5087,LUK,19,KJV,and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt
5088,LUK,19,KJV,and they said the lord hath need of him
5089,LUK,19,KJV,and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus thereon
5090,LUK,19,KJV,and as he went they spread their clothes in the way
5091,LUK,19,KJV,and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen
5092,LUK,19,KJV,saying blessed
5093,LUK,19,KJV,be
5094,LUK,19,KJV,the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
5095,LUK,19,KJV,and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples
5096,LUK,19,KJV,and he answered and said unto them
5097,LUK,19,KJV,i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out
5098,LUK,19,KJV,and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it
5099,LUK,19,KJV,saying
5100,LUK,19,KJV,if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things
5101,LUK,19,KJV,which belong
5102,LUK,19,KJV,unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes
5103,LUK,19,KJV,for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side
5104,LUK,19,KJV,and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation
5105,LUK,19,KJV,and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought
5106,LUK,19,KJV,saying unto them
5107,LUK,19,KJV,it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
5108,LUK,19,KJV,and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him
5109,LUK,19,KJV,and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him
5110,LUK,20,KJV,and it came to pass
5111,LUK,20,KJV,that
5112,LUK,20,KJV,on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon
5113,LUK,20,KJV,him
5114,LUK,20,KJV,with the elders
5115,LUK,20,KJV,and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority
5116,LUK,20,KJV,and he answered and said unto them
5117,LUK,20,KJV,i will also ask you one thing and answer me
5118,LUK,20,KJV,the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men
5119,LUK,20,KJV,and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not
5120,LUK,20,KJV,but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet
5121,LUK,20,KJV,and they answered that they could not tell whence
5122,LUK,20,KJV,it was
5123,LUK,20,KJV,
5124,LUK,20,KJV,and jesus said unto them
5125,LUK,20,KJV,neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
5126,LUK,20,KJV,then began he to speak to the people this parable
5127,LUK,20,KJV,a certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time
5128,LUK,20,KJV,and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent
5129,LUK,20,KJV,him
5130,LUK,20,KJV,away empty
5131,LUK,20,KJV,and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated
5132,LUK,20,KJV,him
5133,LUK,20,KJV,shamefully and sent
5134,LUK,20,KJV,him
5135,LUK,20,KJV,away empty
5136,LUK,20,KJV,and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast
5137,LUK,20,KJV,him
5138,LUK,20,KJV,out
5139,LUK,20,KJV,then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence
5140,LUK,20,KJV,him
5141,LUK,20,KJV,when they see him
5142,LUK,20,KJV,but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours
5143,LUK,20,KJV,so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed
5144,LUK,20,KJV,him
5145,LUK,20,KJV,what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them
5146,LUK,20,KJV,he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others
5147,LUK,20,KJV,and when they heard
5148,LUK,20,KJV,it
5149,LUK,20,KJV,they said god forbid
5150,LUK,20,KJV,and he beheld them and said
5151,LUK,20,KJV,what is this then that is written
5152,LUK,20,KJV,the stone which the builders rejected
5153,LUK,20,KJV,the same is become the head of the corner
5154,LUK,20,KJV,whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
5155,LUK,20,KJV,and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them
5156,LUK,20,KJV,and they watched
5157,LUK,20,KJV,him
5158,LUK,20,KJV,and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor
5159,LUK,20,KJV,and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person
5160,LUK,20,KJV,of any
5161,LUK,20,KJV,but teachest the way of god truly
5162,LUK,20,KJV,is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or no
5163,LUK,20,KJV,but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them
5164,LUK,20,KJV,why tempt ye me
5165,LUK,20,KJV,shew me a penny whose image and superscription hath it
5166,LUK,20,KJV,they answered and said caesars
5167,LUK,20,KJV,and he said unto them
5168,LUK,20,KJV,render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods
5169,LUK,20,KJV,and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace
5170,LUK,20,KJV,then came to
5171,LUK,20,KJV,him
5172,LUK,20,KJV,certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him
5173,LUK,20,KJV,saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
5174,LUK,20,KJV,there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children
5175,LUK,20,KJV,and the second took her to wife and he died childless
5176,LUK,20,KJV,and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died
5177,LUK,20,KJV,last of all the woman died also
5178,LUK,20,KJV,therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her to wife
5179,LUK,20,KJV,and jesus answering said unto them
5180,LUK,20,KJV,the children of this world marry and are given in marriage
5181,LUK,20,KJV,but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
5182,LUK,20,KJV,neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
5183,LUK,20,KJV,now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
5184,LUK,20,KJV,for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him
5185,LUK,20,KJV,then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said
5186,LUK,20,KJV,and after that they durst not ask him any
5187,LUK,20,KJV,question at all
5188,LUK,20,KJV,
5189,LUK,20,KJV,and he said unto them
5190,LUK,20,KJV,how say they that christ is davids son
5191,LUK,20,KJV,and david himself saith in the book of psalms
5192,LUK,20,KJV,the
5193,LUK,20,KJV,lord
5194,LUK,20,KJV,said unto my lord
5195,LUK,20,KJV,sit thou on my right hand
5196,LUK,20,KJV,till i make thine enemies thy footstool
5197,LUK,20,KJV,david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son
5198,LUK,20,KJV,then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples
5199,LUK,20,KJV,beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts
5200,LUK,20,KJV,which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation
5201,LUK,21,KJV,and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury
5202,LUK,21,KJV,and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites
5203,LUK,21,KJV,and he said
5204,LUK,21,KJV,of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all
5205,LUK,21,KJV,for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had
5206,LUK,21,KJV,and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said
5207,LUK,21,KJV,as for
5208,LUK,21,KJV,these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
5209,LUK,21,KJV,and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be and what sign
5210,LUK,21,KJV,will there be
5211,LUK,21,KJV,when these things shall come to pass
5212,LUK,21,KJV,and he said
5213,LUK,21,KJV,take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am
5214,LUK,21,KJV,christ
5215,LUK,21,KJV,and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them
5216,LUK,21,KJV,but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end
5217,LUK,21,KJV,is
5218,LUK,21,KJV,not by and by
5219,LUK,21,KJV,then said he unto them
5220,LUK,21,KJV,nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
5221,LUK,21,KJV,and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven
5222,LUK,21,KJV,but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute
5223,LUK,21,KJV,you
5224,LUK,21,KJV,delivering
5225,LUK,21,KJV,you
5226,LUK,21,KJV,up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake
5227,LUK,21,KJV,and it shall turn to you for a testimony
5228,LUK,21,KJV,settle
5229,LUK,21,KJV,it
5230,LUK,21,KJV,therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer
5231,LUK,21,KJV,for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
5232,LUK,21,KJV,and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and
5233,LUK,21,KJV,some
5234,LUK,21,KJV,of you shall they cause to be put to death
5235,LUK,21,KJV,and ye shall be hated of all
5236,LUK,21,KJV,men
5237,LUK,21,KJV,for my names sake
5238,LUK,21,KJV,but there shall not an hair of your head perish
5239,LUK,21,KJV,in your patience possess ye your souls
5240,LUK,21,KJV,and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
5241,LUK,21,KJV,then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto
5242,LUK,21,KJV,for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled
5243,LUK,21,KJV,but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people
5244,LUK,21,KJV,and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
5245,LUK,21,KJV,and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
5246,LUK,21,KJV,mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
5247,LUK,21,KJV,and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
5248,LUK,21,KJV,and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh
5249,LUK,21,KJV,and he spake to them a parable
5250,LUK,21,KJV,behold the fig tree and all the trees
5251,LUK,21,KJV,when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
5252,LUK,21,KJV,so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand
5253,LUK,21,KJV,verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled
5254,LUK,21,KJV,heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
5255,LUK,21,KJV,and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and
5256,LUK,21,KJV,so
5257,LUK,21,KJV,that day come upon you unawares
5258,LUK,21,KJV,for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth
5259,LUK,21,KJV,watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man
5260,LUK,21,KJV,and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called
5261,LUK,21,KJV,the mount
5262,LUK,21,KJV,of olives
5263,LUK,21,KJV,and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him
5264,LUK,22,KJV,now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover
5265,LUK,22,KJV,and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him for they feared the people
5266,LUK,22,KJV,then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve
5267,LUK,22,KJV,and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them
5268,LUK,22,KJV,and they were glad and covenanted to give him money
5269,LUK,22,KJV,and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude
5270,LUK,22,KJV,then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed
5271,LUK,22,KJV,and he sent peter and john saying
5272,LUK,22,KJV,go and prepare us the passover that we may eat
5273,LUK,22,KJV,and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare
5274,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto them
5275,LUK,22,KJV,behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in
5276,LUK,22,KJV,and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples
5277,LUK,22,KJV,and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished there make ready
5278,LUK,22,KJV,and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
5279,LUK,22,KJV,and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him
5280,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto them
5281,LUK,22,KJV,with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
5282,LUK,22,KJV,for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
5283,LUK,22,KJV,and he took the cup and gave thanks and said
5284,LUK,22,KJV,take this and divide
5285,LUK,22,KJV,it
5286,LUK,22,KJV,among yourselves
5287,LUK,22,KJV,for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come
5288,LUK,22,KJV,and he took bread and gave thanks and brake
5289,LUK,22,KJV,it
5290,LUK,22,KJV,and gave unto them saying
5291,LUK,22,KJV,this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me
5292,LUK,22,KJV,likewise also the cup after supper saying
5293,LUK,22,KJV,this cup
5294,LUK,22,KJV,is
5295,LUK,22,KJV,the new testament in my blood which is shed for you
5296,LUK,22,KJV,but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me
5297,LUK,22,KJV,is
5298,LUK,22,KJV,with me on the table
5299,LUK,22,KJV,and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed
5300,LUK,22,KJV,and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing
5301,LUK,22,KJV,and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest
5302,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto them
5303,LUK,22,KJV,the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors
5304,LUK,22,KJV,but ye
5305,LUK,22,KJV,shall
5306,LUK,22,KJV,not
5307,LUK,22,KJV,be
5308,LUK,22,KJV,so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve
5309,LUK,22,KJV,for whether
5310,LUK,22,KJV,is
5311,LUK,22,KJV,greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth
5312,LUK,22,KJV,is
5313,LUK,22,KJV,not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as he that serveth
5314,LUK,22,KJV,ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
5315,LUK,22,KJV,and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me
5316,LUK,22,KJV,that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
5317,LUK,22,KJV,and the lord said
5318,LUK,22,KJV,simon simon behold satan hath desired
5319,LUK,22,KJV,to have
5320,LUK,22,KJV,you that he may sift
5321,LUK,22,KJV,you
5322,LUK,22,KJV,as wheat
5323,LUK,22,KJV,but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren
5324,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death
5325,LUK,22,KJV,and he said
5326,LUK,22,KJV,i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me
5327,LUK,22,KJV,and he said unto them
5328,LUK,22,KJV,when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing
5329,LUK,22,KJV,and they said nothing
5330,LUK,22,KJV,then said he unto them
5331,LUK,22,KJV,but now he that hath a purse let him take
5332,LUK,22,KJV,it
5333,LUK,22,KJV,and likewise
5334,LUK,22,KJV,his
5335,LUK,22,KJV,scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5336,LUK,22,KJV,for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end
5337,LUK,22,KJV,and they said lord behold here
5338,LUK,22,KJV,are
5339,LUK,22,KJV,two swords and he said unto them
5340,LUK,22,KJV,it is enough
5341,LUK,22,KJV,and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him
5342,LUK,22,KJV,and when he was at the place he said unto them
5343,LUK,22,KJV,pray that ye enter not into temptation
5344,LUK,22,KJV,and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeled down and prayed
5345,LUK,22,KJV,saying
5346,LUK,22,KJV,father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
5347,LUK,22,KJV,and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him
5348,LUK,22,KJV,and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
5349,LUK,22,KJV,and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow
5350,LUK,22,KJV,and said unto them
5351,LUK,22,KJV,why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation
5352,LUK,22,KJV,and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him
5353,LUK,22,KJV,but jesus said unto him
5354,LUK,22,KJV,judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss
5355,LUK,22,KJV,when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword
5356,LUK,22,KJV,and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear
5357,LUK,22,KJV,and jesus answered and said
5358,LUK,22,KJV,suffer ye thus far
5359,LUK,22,KJV,and he touched his ear and healed him
5360,LUK,22,KJV,then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him
5361,LUK,22,KJV,be ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves
5362,LUK,22,KJV,when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness
5363,LUK,22,KJV,then took they him and led
5364,LUK,22,KJV,him
5365,LUK,22,KJV,and brought him into the high priests house and peter followed afar off
5366,LUK,22,KJV,and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together peter sat down among them
5367,LUK,22,KJV,but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him
5368,LUK,22,KJV,and he denied him saying woman i know him not
5369,LUK,22,KJV,and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not
5370,LUK,22,KJV,and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this
5371,LUK,22,KJV,fellow
5372,LUK,22,KJV,also was with him for he is a galilaean
5373,LUK,22,KJV,and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew
5374,LUK,22,KJV,and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
5375,LUK,22,KJV,and peter went out and wept bitterly
5376,LUK,22,KJV,and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote
5377,LUK,22,KJV,him
5378,LUK,22,KJV,
5379,LUK,22,KJV,and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee
5380,LUK,22,KJV,and many other things blasphemously spake they against him
5381,LUK,22,KJV,and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying
5382,LUK,22,KJV,art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them
5383,LUK,22,KJV,if i tell you ye will not believe
5384,LUK,22,KJV,and if i also ask
5385,LUK,22,KJV,you
5386,LUK,22,KJV,ye will not answer me nor let
5387,LUK,22,KJV,me
5388,LUK,22,KJV,go
5389,LUK,22,KJV,hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god
5390,LUK,22,KJV,then said they all art thou then the son of god and he said unto them
5391,LUK,22,KJV,ye say that i am
5392,LUK,22,KJV,and they said what need we any further witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth
5393,LUK,23,KJV,and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate
5394,LUK,23,KJV,and they began to accuse him saying we found this
5395,LUK,23,KJV,fellow
5396,LUK,23,KJV,perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king
5397,LUK,23,KJV,and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said
5398,LUK,23,KJV,thou sayest
5399,LUK,23,KJV,it
5400,LUK,23,KJV,then said pilate to the chief priests and
5401,LUK,23,KJV,to
5402,LUK,23,KJV,the people i find no fault in this man
5403,LUK,23,KJV,and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place
5404,LUK,23,KJV,when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean
5405,LUK,23,KJV,and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time
5406,LUK,23,KJV,and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long
5407,LUK,23,KJV,season
5408,LUK,23,KJV,because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
5409,LUK,23,KJV,then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing
5410,LUK,23,KJV,and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him
5411,LUK,23,KJV,and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked
5412,LUK,23,KJV,him
5413,LUK,23,KJV,and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate
5414,LUK,23,KJV,and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves
5415,LUK,23,KJV,and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
5416,LUK,23,KJV,said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined
5417,LUK,23,KJV,him
5418,LUK,23,KJV,before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him
5419,LUK,23,KJV,no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him
5420,LUK,23,KJV,i will therefore chastise him and release
5421,LUK,23,KJV,him
5422,LUK,23,KJV,
5423,LUK,23,KJV,for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast
5424,LUK,23,KJV,and they cried out all at once saying away with this
5425,LUK,23,KJV,man
5426,LUK,23,KJV,and release unto us barabbas
5427,LUK,23,KJV,who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison
5428,LUK,23,KJV,pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them
5429,LUK,23,KJV,but they cried saying crucify
5430,LUK,23,KJV,him
5431,LUK,23,KJV,crucify him
5432,LUK,23,KJV,and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let
5433,LUK,23,KJV,him
5434,LUK,23,KJV,go
5435,LUK,23,KJV,and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed
5436,LUK,23,KJV,and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
5437,LUK,23,KJV,and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will
5438,LUK,23,KJV,and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear
5439,LUK,23,KJV,it
5440,LUK,23,KJV,after jesus
5441,LUK,23,KJV,and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him
5442,LUK,23,KJV,but jesus turning unto them said
5443,LUK,23,KJV,daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
5444,LUK,23,KJV,for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed
5445,LUK,23,KJV,are
5446,LUK,23,KJV,the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck
5447,LUK,23,KJV,then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us
5448,LUK,23,KJV,for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry
5449,LUK,23,KJV,and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death
5450,LUK,23,KJV,and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left
5451,LUK,23,KJV,then said jesus
5452,LUK,23,KJV,father forgive them for they know not what they do
5453,LUK,23,KJV,and they parted his raiment and cast lots
5454,LUK,23,KJV,and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided
5455,LUK,23,KJV,him
5456,LUK,23,KJV,saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god
5457,LUK,23,KJV,and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar
5458,LUK,23,KJV,and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself
5459,LUK,23,KJV,and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews
5460,LUK,23,KJV,and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us
5461,LUK,23,KJV,but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation
5462,LUK,23,KJV,and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss
5463,LUK,23,KJV,and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom
5464,LUK,23,KJV,and jesus said unto him
5465,LUK,23,KJV,verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise
5466,LUK,23,KJV,and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour
5467,LUK,23,KJV,and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst
5468,LUK,23,KJV,and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said
5469,LUK,23,KJV,father into thy hands i commend my spirit
5470,LUK,23,KJV,and having said thus he gave up the ghost
5471,LUK,23,KJV,now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man
5472,LUK,23,KJV,and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned
5473,LUK,23,KJV,and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things
5474,LUK,23,KJV,and behold
5475,LUK,23,KJV,there was
5476,LUK,23,KJV,a man named joseph a counsellor
5477,LUK,23,KJV,and he was
5478,LUK,23,KJV,a good man and a just
5479,LUK,23,KJV,the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them
5480,LUK,23,KJV,he was
5481,LUK,23,KJV,of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god
5482,LUK,23,KJV,this
5483,LUK,23,KJV,man
5484,LUK,23,KJV,went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus
5485,LUK,23,KJV,and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid
5486,LUK,23,KJV,and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on
5487,LUK,23,KJV,and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid
5488,LUK,23,KJV,and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment
5489,LUK,24,KJV,now upon the first
5490,LUK,24,KJV,day
5491,LUK,24,KJV,of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain
5492,LUK,24,KJV,others
5493,LUK,24,KJV,with them
5494,LUK,24,KJV,and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
5495,LUK,24,KJV,and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus
5496,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments
5497,LUK,24,KJV,and as they were afraid and bowed down
5498,LUK,24,KJV,their
5499,LUK,24,KJV,faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead
5500,LUK,24,KJV,he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee
5501,LUK,24,KJV,saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again
5502,LUK,24,KJV,and they remembered his words
5503,LUK,24,KJV,and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest
5504,LUK,24,KJV,it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary
5505,LUK,24,KJV,the mother
5506,LUK,24,KJV,of james and other
5507,LUK,24,KJV,women that were
5508,LUK,24,KJV,with them which told these things unto the apostles
5509,LUK,24,KJV,and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not
5510,LUK,24,KJV,then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass
5511,LUK,24,KJV,and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem
5512,LUK,24,KJV,about
5513,LUK,24,KJV,threescore furlongs
5514,LUK,24,KJV,and they talked together of all these things which had happened
5515,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass that while they communed
5516,LUK,24,KJV,together
5517,LUK,24,KJV,and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them
5518,LUK,24,KJV,but their eyes were holden that they should not know him
5519,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them
5520,LUK,24,KJV,what manner of communications
5521,LUK,24,KJV,are
5522,LUK,24,KJV,these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad
5523,LUK,24,KJV,and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days
5524,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them
5525,LUK,24,KJV,what things
5526,LUK,24,KJV,and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
5527,LUK,24,KJV,and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him
5528,LUK,24,KJV,but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done
5529,LUK,24,KJV,yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre
5530,LUK,24,KJV,and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive
5531,LUK,24,KJV,and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found
5532,LUK,24,KJV,it
5533,LUK,24,KJV,even so as the women had said but him they saw not
5534,LUK,24,KJV,then he said unto them
5535,LUK,24,KJV,o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
5536,LUK,24,KJV,ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory
5537,LUK,24,KJV,and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
5538,LUK,24,KJV,and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further
5539,LUK,24,KJV,but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them
5540,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed
5541,LUK,24,KJV,it
5542,LUK,24,KJV,and brake and gave to them
5543,LUK,24,KJV,and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight
5544,LUK,24,KJV,and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures
5545,LUK,24,KJV,and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them
5546,LUK,24,KJV,saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon
5547,LUK,24,KJV,and they told what things
5548,LUK,24,KJV,were done
5549,LUK,24,KJV,in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread
5550,LUK,24,KJV,and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them
5551,LUK,24,KJV,peace
5552,LUK,24,KJV,be
5553,LUK,24,KJV,unto you
5554,LUK,24,KJV,but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit
5555,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them
5556,LUK,24,KJV,why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts
5557,LUK,24,KJV,behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have
5558,LUK,24,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he shewed them
5559,LUK,24,KJV,his
5560,LUK,24,KJV,hands and
5561,LUK,24,KJV,his
5562,LUK,24,KJV,feet
5563,LUK,24,KJV,and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them
5564,LUK,24,KJV,have ye here any meat
5565,LUK,24,KJV,and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb
5566,LUK,24,KJV,and he took
5567,LUK,24,KJV,it
5568,LUK,24,KJV,and did eat before them
5569,LUK,24,KJV,and he said unto them
5570,LUK,24,KJV,these
5571,LUK,24,KJV,are
5572,LUK,24,KJV,the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and
5573,LUK,24,KJV,in
5574,LUK,24,KJV,the prophets and
5575,LUK,24,KJV,in
5576,LUK,24,KJV,the psalms concerning me
5577,LUK,24,KJV,then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures
5578,LUK,24,KJV,and said unto them
5579,LUK,24,KJV,thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
5580,LUK,24,KJV,and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
5581,LUK,24,KJV,and ye are witnesses of these things
5582,LUK,24,KJV,and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high
5583,LUK,24,KJV,and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them
5584,LUK,24,KJV,and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven
5585,LUK,24,KJV,and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy
5586,LUK,24,KJV,and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen
5587,JHN,1,KJV,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
5588,JHN,1,KJV,the same was in the beginning with god
5589,JHN,1,KJV,all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made
5590,JHN,1,KJV,in him was life and the life was the light of men
5591,JHN,1,KJV,and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not
5592,JHN,1,KJV,there was a man sent from god whose name
5593,JHN,1,KJV,was
5594,JHN,1,KJV,john
5595,JHN,1,KJV,the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all
5596,JHN,1,KJV,men
5597,JHN,1,KJV,through him might believe
5598,JHN,1,KJV,he was not that light but
5599,JHN,1,KJV,was sent
5600,JHN,1,KJV,to bear witness of that light
5601,JHN,1,KJV,that
5602,JHN,1,KJV,was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
5603,JHN,1,KJV,he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not
5604,JHN,1,KJV,he came unto his own and his own received him not
5605,JHN,1,KJV,but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god
5606,JHN,1,KJV,even
5607,JHN,1,KJV,to them that believe on his name
5608,JHN,1,KJV,which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
5609,JHN,1,KJV,and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
5610,JHN,1,KJV,john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me
5611,JHN,1,KJV,and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace
5612,JHN,1,KJV,for the law was given by moses
5613,JHN,1,KJV,but
5614,JHN,1,KJV,grace and truth came by jesus christ
5615,JHN,1,KJV,no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared
5616,JHN,1,KJV,him
5617,JHN,1,KJV,and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou
5618,JHN,1,KJV,and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ
5619,JHN,1,KJV,and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no
5620,JHN,1,KJV,then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself
5621,JHN,1,KJV,he said i
5622,JHN,1,KJV,am
5623,JHN,1,KJV,the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet esaias
5624,JHN,1,KJV,and they which were sent were of the pharisees
5625,JHN,1,KJV,and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet
5626,JHN,1,KJV,john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not
5627,JHN,1,KJV,he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose
5628,JHN,1,KJV,these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing
5629,JHN,1,KJV,the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
5630,JHN,1,KJV,this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me
5631,JHN,1,KJV,and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water
5632,JHN,1,KJV,and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him
5633,JHN,1,KJV,and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost
5634,JHN,1,KJV,and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god
5635,JHN,1,KJV,again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples
5636,JHN,1,KJV,and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god
5637,JHN,1,KJV,and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus
5638,JHN,1,KJV,then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them
5639,JHN,1,KJV,what seek ye
5640,JHN,1,KJV,they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou
5641,JHN,1,KJV,he saith unto them
5642,JHN,1,KJV,come and see
5643,JHN,1,KJV,they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour
5644,JHN,1,KJV,one of the two which heard john
5645,JHN,1,KJV,speak
5646,JHN,1,KJV,and followed him was andrew simon peters brother
5647,JHN,1,KJV,he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ
5648,JHN,1,KJV,and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said
5649,JHN,1,KJV,thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas
5650,JHN,1,KJV,which is by interpretation a stone
5651,JHN,1,KJV,the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him
5652,JHN,1,KJV,follow me
5653,JHN,1,KJV,now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
5654,JHN,1,KJV,philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
5655,JHN,1,KJV,and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see
5656,JHN,1,KJV,jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him
5657,JHN,1,KJV,behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile
5658,JHN,1,KJV,nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him
5659,JHN,1,KJV,before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee
5660,JHN,1,KJV,nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel
5661,JHN,1,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him
5662,JHN,1,KJV,because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these
5663,JHN,1,KJV,and he saith unto him
5664,JHN,1,KJV,verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
5665,JHN,2,KJV,and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there
5666,JHN,2,KJV,and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage
5667,JHN,2,KJV,and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine
5668,JHN,2,KJV,jesus saith unto her
5669,JHN,2,KJV,woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come
5670,JHN,2,KJV,his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do
5671,JHN,2,KJV,it
5672,JHN,2,KJV,
5673,JHN,2,KJV,and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece
5674,JHN,2,KJV,jesus saith unto them
5675,JHN,2,KJV,fill the waterpots with water
5676,JHN,2,KJV,and they filled them up to the brim
5677,JHN,2,KJV,and he saith unto them
5678,JHN,2,KJV,draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast
5679,JHN,2,KJV,and they bare
5680,JHN,2,KJV,it
5681,JHN,2,KJV,
5682,JHN,2,KJV,when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom
5683,JHN,2,KJV,and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse
5684,JHN,2,KJV,but
5685,JHN,2,KJV,thou hast kept the good wine until now
5686,JHN,2,KJV,this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him
5687,JHN,2,KJV,after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days
5688,JHN,2,KJV,and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem
5689,JHN,2,KJV,and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting
5690,JHN,2,KJV,and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables
5691,JHN,2,KJV,and said unto them that sold doves
5692,JHN,2,KJV,take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise
5693,JHN,2,KJV,and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
5694,JHN,2,KJV,then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things
5695,JHN,2,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
5696,JHN,2,KJV,destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
5697,JHN,2,KJV,then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days
5698,JHN,2,KJV,but he spake of the temple of his body
5699,JHN,2,KJV,when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said
5700,JHN,2,KJV,now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast
5701,JHN,2,KJV,day
5702,JHN,2,KJV,many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did
5703,JHN,2,KJV,but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all
5704,JHN,2,KJV,men
5705,JHN,2,KJV,
5706,JHN,2,KJV,and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man
5707,JHN,3,KJV,there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
5708,JHN,3,KJV,the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him
5709,JHN,3,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him
5710,JHN,3,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
5711,JHN,3,KJV,nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born
5712,JHN,3,KJV,jesus answered
5713,JHN,3,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and
5714,JHN,3,KJV,of
5715,JHN,3,KJV,the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
5716,JHN,3,KJV,that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
5717,JHN,3,KJV,marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again
5718,JHN,3,KJV,the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit
5719,JHN,3,KJV,nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be
5720,JHN,3,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him
5721,JHN,3,KJV,art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things
5722,JHN,3,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness
5723,JHN,3,KJV,if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you
5724,JHN,3,KJV,of
5725,JHN,3,KJV,heavenly things
5726,JHN,3,KJV,and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven
5727,JHN,3,KJV,even
5728,JHN,3,KJV,the son of man which is in heaven
5729,JHN,3,KJV,and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up
5730,JHN,3,KJV,that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life
5731,JHN,3,KJV,for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
5732,JHN,3,KJV,for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
5733,JHN,3,KJV,he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
5734,JHN,3,KJV,and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil
5735,JHN,3,KJV,for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
5736,JHN,3,KJV,but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god
5737,JHN,3,KJV,after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized
5738,JHN,3,KJV,and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized
5739,JHN,3,KJV,for john was not yet cast into prison
5740,JHN,3,KJV,then there arose a question between
5741,JHN,3,KJV,some
5742,JHN,3,KJV,of johns disciples and the jews about purifying
5743,JHN,3,KJV,and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all
5744,JHN,3,KJV,men
5745,JHN,3,KJV,come to him
5746,JHN,3,KJV,john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven
5747,JHN,3,KJV,ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him
5748,JHN,3,KJV,he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled
5749,JHN,3,KJV,he must increase but i
5750,JHN,3,KJV,must
5751,JHN,3,KJV,decrease
5752,JHN,3,KJV,he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all
5753,JHN,3,KJV,and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony
5754,JHN,3,KJV,he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true
5755,JHN,3,KJV,for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure
5756,JHN,3,KJV,unto him
5757,JHN,3,KJV,
5758,JHN,3,KJV,the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand
5759,JHN,3,KJV,he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
5760,JHN,4,KJV,when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john
5761,JHN,4,KJV,though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples
5762,JHN,4,KJV,he left judaea and departed again into galilee
5763,JHN,4,KJV,and he must needs go through samaria
5764,JHN,4,KJV,then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph
5765,JHN,4,KJV,now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied with
5766,JHN,4,KJV,his
5767,JHN,4,KJV,journey sat thus on the well
5768,JHN,4,KJV,and
5769,JHN,4,KJV,it was about the sixth hour
5770,JHN,4,KJV,there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her
5771,JHN,4,KJV,give me to drink
5772,JHN,4,KJV,for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat
5773,JHN,4,KJV,then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans
5774,JHN,4,KJV,jesus answered and said unto her
5775,JHN,4,KJV,if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water
5776,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water
5777,JHN,4,KJV,art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle
5778,JHN,4,KJV,jesus answered and said unto her
5779,JHN,4,KJV,whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
5780,JHN,4,KJV,but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life
5781,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw
5782,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto her
5783,JHN,4,KJV,go call thy husband and come hither
5784,JHN,4,KJV,the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her
5785,JHN,4,KJV,thou hast well said i have no husband
5786,JHN,4,KJV,for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly
5787,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet
5788,JHN,4,KJV,our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship
5789,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto her
5790,JHN,4,KJV,woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father
5791,JHN,4,KJV,ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews
5792,JHN,4,KJV,but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him
5793,JHN,4,KJV,god
5794,JHN,4,KJV,is
5795,JHN,4,KJV,a spirit and they that worship him must worship
5796,JHN,4,KJV,him
5797,JHN,4,KJV,in spirit and in truth
5798,JHN,4,KJV,the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things
5799,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto her
5800,JHN,4,KJV,i that speak unto thee am
5801,JHN,4,KJV,he
5802,JHN,4,KJV,and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her
5803,JHN,4,KJV,the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men
5804,JHN,4,KJV,come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ
5805,JHN,4,KJV,then they went out of the city and came unto him
5806,JHN,4,KJV,in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat
5807,JHN,4,KJV,but he said unto them
5808,JHN,4,KJV,i have meat to eat that ye know not of
5809,JHN,4,KJV,therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him
5810,JHN,4,KJV,ought
5811,JHN,4,KJV,to eat
5812,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto them
5813,JHN,4,KJV,my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
5814,JHN,4,KJV,say not ye there are yet four months and
5815,JHN,4,KJV,then
5816,JHN,4,KJV,cometh harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest
5817,JHN,4,KJV,and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together
5818,JHN,4,KJV,and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth
5819,JHN,4,KJV,i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours
5820,JHN,4,KJV,and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did
5821,JHN,4,KJV,so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days
5822,JHN,4,KJV,and many more believed because of his own word
5823,JHN,4,KJV,and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard
5824,JHN,4,KJV,him
5825,JHN,4,KJV,ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world
5826,JHN,4,KJV,now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee
5827,JHN,4,KJV,for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country
5828,JHN,4,KJV,then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast
5829,JHN,4,KJV,so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum
5830,JHN,4,KJV,when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death
5831,JHN,4,KJV,then said jesus unto him
5832,JHN,4,KJV,except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe
5833,JHN,4,KJV,the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die
5834,JHN,4,KJV,jesus saith unto him
5835,JHN,4,KJV,go thy way thy son liveth
5836,JHN,4,KJV,and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way
5837,JHN,4,KJV,and as he was now going down his servants met him and told
5838,JHN,4,KJV,him
5839,JHN,4,KJV,saying thy son liveth
5840,JHN,4,KJV,then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
5841,JHN,4,KJV,so the father knew that
5842,JHN,4,KJV,it was
5843,JHN,4,KJV,at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him
5844,JHN,4,KJV,thy son liveth
5845,JHN,4,KJV,and himself believed and his whole house
5846,JHN,4,KJV,this
5847,JHN,4,KJV,is
5848,JHN,4,KJV,again the second miracle
5849,JHN,4,KJV,that
5850,JHN,4,KJV,jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee
5851,JHN,5,KJV,after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
5852,JHN,5,KJV,now there is at jerusalem by the sheep
5853,JHN,5,KJV,market
5854,JHN,5,KJV,a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches
5855,JHN,5,KJV,in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water
5856,JHN,5,KJV,for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had
5857,JHN,5,KJV,and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years
5858,JHN,5,KJV,when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time
5859,JHN,5,KJV,in that case
5860,JHN,5,KJV,he saith unto him
5861,JHN,5,KJV,wilt thou be made whole
5862,JHN,5,KJV,the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me
5863,JHN,5,KJV,jesus saith unto him
5864,JHN,5,KJV,rise take up thy bed and walk
5865,JHN,5,KJV,and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath
5866,JHN,5,KJV,the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry
5867,JHN,5,KJV,thy
5868,JHN,5,KJV,bed
5869,JHN,5,KJV,he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk
5870,JHN,5,KJV,then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk
5871,JHN,5,KJV,and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in
5872,JHN,5,KJV,that
5873,JHN,5,KJV,place
5874,JHN,5,KJV,afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him
5875,JHN,5,KJV,behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee
5876,JHN,5,KJV,the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole
5877,JHN,5,KJV,and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day
5878,JHN,5,KJV,but jesus answered them
5879,JHN,5,KJV,my father worketh hitherto and i work
5880,JHN,5,KJV,therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god
5881,JHN,5,KJV,then answered jesus and said unto them
5882,JHN,5,KJV,verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise
5883,JHN,5,KJV,for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel
5884,JHN,5,KJV,for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth
5885,JHN,5,KJV,them
5886,JHN,5,KJV,even so the son quickeneth whom he will
5887,JHN,5,KJV,for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son
5888,JHN,5,KJV,that all
5889,JHN,5,KJV,men
5890,JHN,5,KJV,should honour the son even as they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him
5891,JHN,5,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
5892,JHN,5,KJV,verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live
5893,JHN,5,KJV,for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself
5894,JHN,5,KJV,and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man
5895,JHN,5,KJV,marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice
5896,JHN,5,KJV,and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
5897,JHN,5,KJV,i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me
5898,JHN,5,KJV,if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true
5899,JHN,5,KJV,there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true
5900,JHN,5,KJV,ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth
5901,JHN,5,KJV,but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved
5902,JHN,5,KJV,he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light
5903,JHN,5,KJV,but i have greater witness than
5904,JHN,5,KJV,that
5905,JHN,5,KJV,of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me
5906,JHN,5,KJV,and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
5907,JHN,5,KJV,and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not
5908,JHN,5,KJV,search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me
5909,JHN,5,KJV,and ye will not come to me that ye might have life
5910,JHN,5,KJV,i receive not honour from men
5911,JHN,5,KJV,but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you
5912,JHN,5,KJV,i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive
5913,JHN,5,KJV,how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that
5914,JHN,5,KJV,cometh
5915,JHN,5,KJV,from god only
5916,JHN,5,KJV,do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is
5917,JHN,5,KJV,one
5918,JHN,5,KJV,that accuseth you
5919,JHN,5,KJV,even
5920,JHN,5,KJV,moses in whom ye trust
5921,JHN,5,KJV,for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me
5922,JHN,5,KJV,but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words
5923,JHN,6,KJV,after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is
5924,JHN,6,KJV,the sea
5925,JHN,6,KJV,of tiberias
5926,JHN,6,KJV,and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased
5927,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples
5928,JHN,6,KJV,and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh
5929,JHN,6,KJV,when jesus then lifted up
5930,JHN,6,KJV,his
5931,JHN,6,KJV,eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip
5932,JHN,6,KJV,whence shall we buy bread that these may eat
5933,JHN,6,KJV,and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do
5934,JHN,6,KJV,philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little
5935,JHN,6,KJV,one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto him
5936,JHN,6,KJV,there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many
5937,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus said
5938,JHN,6,KJV,make the men sit down
5939,JHN,6,KJV,now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand
5940,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would
5941,JHN,6,KJV,when they were filled he said unto his disciples
5942,JHN,6,KJV,gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost
5943,JHN,6,KJV,therefore they gathered
5944,JHN,6,KJV,them
5945,JHN,6,KJV,together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten
5946,JHN,6,KJV,then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world
5947,JHN,6,KJV,when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone
5948,JHN,6,KJV,and when even was
5949,JHN,6,KJV,now
5950,JHN,6,KJV,come his disciples went down unto the sea
5951,JHN,6,KJV,and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them
5952,JHN,6,KJV,and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
5953,JHN,6,KJV,so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid
5954,JHN,6,KJV,but he saith unto them
5955,JHN,6,KJV,it is i be not afraid
5956,JHN,6,KJV,then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went
5957,JHN,6,KJV,the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but
5958,JHN,6,KJV,that
5959,JHN,6,KJV,his disciples were gone away alone
5960,JHN,6,KJV,howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks
5961,JHN,6,KJV,when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus
5962,JHN,6,KJV,and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither
5963,JHN,6,KJV,jesus answered them and said
5964,JHN,6,KJV,verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled
5965,JHN,6,KJV,labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed
5966,JHN,6,KJV,then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god
5967,JHN,6,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
5968,JHN,6,KJV,this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
5969,JHN,6,KJV,they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work
5970,JHN,6,KJV,our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
5971,JHN,6,KJV,then jesus said unto them
5972,JHN,6,KJV,verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven
5973,JHN,6,KJV,for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world
5974,JHN,6,KJV,then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread
5975,JHN,6,KJV,and jesus said unto them
5976,JHN,6,KJV,i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
5977,JHN,6,KJV,but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not
5978,JHN,6,KJV,all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
5979,JHN,6,KJV,for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me
5980,JHN,6,KJV,and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day
5981,JHN,6,KJV,and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
5982,JHN,6,KJV,the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven
5983,JHN,6,KJV,and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven
5984,JHN,6,KJV,jesus therefore answered and said unto them
5985,JHN,6,KJV,murmur not among yourselves
5986,JHN,6,KJV,no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day
5987,JHN,6,KJV,it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me
5988,JHN,6,KJV,not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father
5989,JHN,6,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life
5990,JHN,6,KJV,i am that bread of life
5991,JHN,6,KJV,your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead
5992,JHN,6,KJV,this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die
5993,JHN,6,KJV,i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world
5994,JHN,6,KJV,the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us
5995,JHN,6,KJV,his
5996,JHN,6,KJV,flesh to eat
5997,JHN,6,KJV,then jesus said unto them
5998,JHN,6,KJV,verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you
5999,JHN,6,KJV,whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day
6000,JHN,6,KJV,for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
6001,JHN,6,KJV,he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him
6002,JHN,6,KJV,as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me
6003,JHN,6,KJV,this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever
6004,JHN,6,KJV,these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum
6005,JHN,6,KJV,many therefore of his disciples when they had heard
6006,JHN,6,KJV,this
6007,JHN,6,KJV,said this is an hard saying who can hear it
6008,JHN,6,KJV,when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them
6009,JHN,6,KJV,doth this offend you
6010,JHN,6,KJV,what
6011,JHN,6,KJV,and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before
6012,JHN,6,KJV,it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you
6013,JHN,6,KJV,they
6014,JHN,6,KJV,are spirit and
6015,JHN,6,KJV,they
6016,JHN,6,KJV,are life
6017,JHN,6,KJV,but there are some of you that believe not
6018,JHN,6,KJV,for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him
6019,JHN,6,KJV,and he said
6020,JHN,6,KJV,therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father
6021,JHN,6,KJV,from that
6022,JHN,6,KJV,time
6023,JHN,6,KJV,many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him
6024,JHN,6,KJV,then said jesus unto the twelve
6025,JHN,6,KJV,will ye also go away
6026,JHN,6,KJV,then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life
6027,JHN,6,KJV,and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god
6028,JHN,6,KJV,jesus answered them
6029,JHN,6,KJV,have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil
6030,JHN,6,KJV,he spake of judas iscariot
6031,JHN,6,KJV,the son
6032,JHN,6,KJV,of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve
6033,JHN,7,KJV,after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him
6034,JHN,7,KJV,now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand
6035,JHN,7,KJV,his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
6036,JHN,7,KJV,for
6037,JHN,7,KJV,there is
6038,JHN,7,KJV,no man
6039,JHN,7,KJV,that
6040,JHN,7,KJV,doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to the world
6041,JHN,7,KJV,for neither did his brethren believe in him
6042,JHN,7,KJV,then jesus said unto them
6043,JHN,7,KJV,my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready
6044,JHN,7,KJV,the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil
6045,JHN,7,KJV,go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come
6046,JHN,7,KJV,when he had said these words unto them he abode
6047,JHN,7,KJV,still
6048,JHN,7,KJV,in galilee
6049,JHN,7,KJV,but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret
6050,JHN,7,KJV,then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he
6051,JHN,7,KJV,and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people
6052,JHN,7,KJV,howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews
6053,JHN,7,KJV,now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught
6054,JHN,7,KJV,and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned
6055,JHN,7,KJV,jesus answered them and said
6056,JHN,7,KJV,my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me
6057,JHN,7,KJV,if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or
6058,JHN,7,KJV,whether
6059,JHN,7,KJV,i speak of myself
6060,JHN,7,KJV,he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him
6061,JHN,7,KJV,did not moses give you the law and
6062,JHN,7,KJV,yet
6063,JHN,7,KJV,none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me
6064,JHN,7,KJV,the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee
6065,JHN,7,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
6066,JHN,7,KJV,i have done one work and ye all marvel
6067,JHN,7,KJV,moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man
6068,JHN,7,KJV,if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day
6069,JHN,7,KJV,judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment
6070,JHN,7,KJV,then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill
6071,JHN,7,KJV,but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ
6072,JHN,7,KJV,howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is
6073,JHN,7,KJV,then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying
6074,JHN,7,KJV,ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not
6075,JHN,7,KJV,but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me
6076,JHN,7,KJV,then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come
6077,JHN,7,KJV,and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this
6078,JHN,7,KJV,man
6079,JHN,7,KJV,hath done
6080,JHN,7,KJV,the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him
6081,JHN,7,KJV,then said jesus unto them
6082,JHN,7,KJV,yet a little while am i with you and
6083,JHN,7,KJV,then
6084,JHN,7,KJV,i go unto him that sent me
6085,JHN,7,KJV,ye shall seek me and shall not find
6086,JHN,7,KJV,me
6087,JHN,7,KJV,and where i am
6088,JHN,7,KJV,thither
6089,JHN,7,KJV,ye cannot come
6090,JHN,7,KJV,then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles
6091,JHN,7,KJV,what
6092,JHN,7,KJV,manner of
6093,JHN,7,KJV,saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find
6094,JHN,7,KJV,me
6095,JHN,7,KJV,and where i am
6096,JHN,7,KJV,thither
6097,JHN,7,KJV,ye cannot come
6098,JHN,7,KJV,in the last day that great
6099,JHN,7,KJV,day
6100,JHN,7,KJV,of the feast jesus stood and cried saying
6101,JHN,7,KJV,if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink
6102,JHN,7,KJV,he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water
6103,JHN,7,KJV,but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet
6104,JHN,7,KJV,given
6105,JHN,7,KJV,because that jesus was not yet glorified
6106,JHN,7,KJV,many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet
6107,JHN,7,KJV,others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galilee
6108,JHN,7,KJV,hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was
6109,JHN,7,KJV,so there was a division among the people because of him
6110,JHN,7,KJV,and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him
6111,JHN,7,KJV,then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him
6112,JHN,7,KJV,the officers answered never man spake like this man
6113,JHN,7,KJV,then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived
6114,JHN,7,KJV,have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him
6115,JHN,7,KJV,but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed
6116,JHN,7,KJV,nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them
6117,JHN,7,KJV,doth our law judge
6118,JHN,7,KJV,any
6119,JHN,7,KJV,man before it hear him and know what he doeth
6120,JHN,7,KJV,they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet
6121,JHN,7,KJV,and every man went unto his own house
6122,JHN,8,KJV,jesus went unto the mount of olives
6123,JHN,8,KJV,and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them
6124,JHN,8,KJV,and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst
6125,JHN,8,KJV,they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act
6126,JHN,8,KJV,now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou
6127,JHN,8,KJV,this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with
6128,JHN,8,KJV,his
6129,JHN,8,KJV,finger wrote on the ground
6130,JHN,8,KJV,as though he heard them not
6131,JHN,8,KJV,
6132,JHN,8,KJV,so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them
6133,JHN,8,KJV,he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her
6134,JHN,8,KJV,and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground
6135,JHN,8,KJV,and they which heard
6136,JHN,8,KJV,it
6137,JHN,8,KJV,being convicted by
6138,JHN,8,KJV,their own
6139,JHN,8,KJV,conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest
6140,JHN,8,KJV,even
6141,JHN,8,KJV,unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst
6142,JHN,8,KJV,when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her
6143,JHN,8,KJV,woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee
6144,JHN,8,KJV,she said no man lord and jesus said unto her
6145,JHN,8,KJV,neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
6146,JHN,8,KJV,then spake jesus again unto them saying
6147,JHN,8,KJV,i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
6148,JHN,8,KJV,the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true
6149,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered and said unto them
6150,JHN,8,KJV,though i bear record of myself
6151,JHN,8,KJV,yet
6152,JHN,8,KJV,my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go
6153,JHN,8,KJV,ye judge after the flesh i judge no man
6154,JHN,8,KJV,and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me
6155,JHN,8,KJV,it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true
6156,JHN,8,KJV,i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me
6157,JHN,8,KJV,then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered
6158,JHN,8,KJV,ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also
6159,JHN,8,KJV,these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come
6160,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus again unto them
6161,JHN,8,KJV,i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come
6162,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whither i go ye cannot come
6163,JHN,8,KJV,and he said unto them
6164,JHN,8,KJV,ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world
6165,JHN,8,KJV,i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am
6166,JHN,8,KJV,he
6167,JHN,8,KJV,ye shall die in your sins
6168,JHN,8,KJV,then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them
6169,JHN,8,KJV,even
6170,JHN,8,KJV,the same
6171,JHN,8,KJV,that i said unto you from the beginning
6172,JHN,8,KJV,i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him
6173,JHN,8,KJV,they understood not that he spake to them of the father
6174,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus unto them
6175,JHN,8,KJV,when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am
6176,JHN,8,KJV,he
6177,JHN,8,KJV,and
6178,JHN,8,KJV,that
6179,JHN,8,KJV,i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things
6180,JHN,8,KJV,and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him
6181,JHN,8,KJV,as he spake these words many believed on him
6182,JHN,8,KJV,then said jesus to those jews which believed on him
6183,JHN,8,KJV,if ye continue in my word
6184,JHN,8,KJV,then
6185,JHN,8,KJV,are ye my disciples indeed
6186,JHN,8,KJV,and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
6187,JHN,8,KJV,they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free
6188,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered them
6189,JHN,8,KJV,verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
6190,JHN,8,KJV,and the servant abideth not in the house for ever
6191,JHN,8,KJV,but
6192,JHN,8,KJV,the son abideth ever
6193,JHN,8,KJV,if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed
6194,JHN,8,KJV,i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you
6195,JHN,8,KJV,i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father
6196,JHN,8,KJV,they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them
6197,JHN,8,KJV,if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham
6198,JHN,8,KJV,but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham
6199,JHN,8,KJV,ye do the deeds of your father
6200,JHN,8,KJV,then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father
6201,JHN,8,KJV,even
6202,JHN,8,KJV,god
6203,JHN,8,KJV,jesus said unto them
6204,JHN,8,KJV,if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me
6205,JHN,8,KJV,why do ye not understand my speech
6206,JHN,8,KJV,even
6207,JHN,8,KJV,because ye cannot hear my word
6208,JHN,8,KJV,ye are of
6209,JHN,8,KJV,your
6210,JHN,8,KJV,father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
6211,JHN,8,KJV,and because i tell
6212,JHN,8,KJV,you
6213,JHN,8,KJV,the truth ye believe me not
6214,JHN,8,KJV,which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me
6215,JHN,8,KJV,he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear
6216,JHN,8,KJV,them
6217,JHN,8,KJV,not because ye are not of god
6218,JHN,8,KJV,then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil
6219,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered
6220,JHN,8,KJV,i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me
6221,JHN,8,KJV,and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth
6222,JHN,8,KJV,verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death
6223,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death
6224,JHN,8,KJV,art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself
6225,JHN,8,KJV,jesus answered
6226,JHN,8,KJV,if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god
6227,JHN,8,KJV,yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying
6228,JHN,8,KJV,your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw
6229,JHN,8,KJV,it
6230,JHN,8,KJV,and was glad
6231,JHN,8,KJV,then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham
6232,JHN,8,KJV,jesus said unto them
6233,JHN,8,KJV,verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am
6234,JHN,8,KJV,then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by
6235,JHN,9,KJV,and as
6236,JHN,9,KJV,jesus
6237,JHN,9,KJV,passed by he saw a man which was blind from
6238,JHN,9,KJV,his
6239,JHN,9,KJV,birth
6240,JHN,9,KJV,and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
6241,JHN,9,KJV,jesus answered
6242,JHN,9,KJV,neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him
6243,JHN,9,KJV,i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work
6244,JHN,9,KJV,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
6245,JHN,9,KJV,when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay
6246,JHN,9,KJV,and said unto him
6247,JHN,9,KJV,go wash in the pool of siloam
6248,JHN,9,KJV,which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing
6249,JHN,9,KJV,the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged
6250,JHN,9,KJV,some said this is he others
6251,JHN,9,KJV,said
6252,JHN,9,KJV,he is like him
6253,JHN,9,KJV,but
6254,JHN,9,KJV,he said i am
6255,JHN,9,KJV,he
6256,JHN,9,KJV,
6257,JHN,9,KJV,therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened
6258,JHN,9,KJV,he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight
6259,JHN,9,KJV,then said they unto him where is he he said i know not
6260,JHN,9,KJV,they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind
6261,JHN,9,KJV,and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes
6262,JHN,9,KJV,then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see
6263,JHN,9,KJV,therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them
6264,JHN,9,KJV,they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet
6265,JHN,9,KJV,but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight
6266,JHN,9,KJV,and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see
6267,JHN,9,KJV,his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
6268,JHN,9,KJV,but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself
6269,JHN,9,KJV,these
6270,JHN,9,KJV,words
6271,JHN,9,KJV,spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue
6272,JHN,9,KJV,therefore said his parents he is of age ask him
6273,JHN,9,KJV,then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner
6274,JHN,9,KJV,he answered and said whether he be a sinner
6275,JHN,9,KJV,or no
6276,JHN,9,KJV,i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see
6277,JHN,9,KJV,then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes
6278,JHN,9,KJV,he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear
6279,JHN,9,KJV,it
6280,JHN,9,KJV,again will ye also be his disciples
6281,JHN,9,KJV,then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples
6282,JHN,9,KJV,we know that god spake unto moses
6283,JHN,9,KJV,as for
6284,JHN,9,KJV,this
6285,JHN,9,KJV,fellow
6286,JHN,9,KJV,we know not from whence he is
6287,JHN,9,KJV,the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and
6288,JHN,9,KJV,yet
6289,JHN,9,KJV,he hath opened mine eyes
6290,JHN,9,KJV,now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth
6291,JHN,9,KJV,since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind
6292,JHN,9,KJV,if this man were not of god he could do nothing
6293,JHN,9,KJV,they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out
6294,JHN,9,KJV,jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him
6295,JHN,9,KJV,dost thou believe on the son of god
6296,JHN,9,KJV,he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him
6297,JHN,9,KJV,and jesus said unto him
6298,JHN,9,KJV,thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee
6299,JHN,9,KJV,and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him
6300,JHN,9,KJV,and jesus said
6301,JHN,9,KJV,for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
6302,JHN,9,KJV,and
6303,JHN,9,KJV,some
6304,JHN,9,KJV,of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also
6305,JHN,9,KJV,jesus said unto them
6306,JHN,9,KJV,if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth
6307,JHN,10,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber
6308,JHN,10,KJV,but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
6309,JHN,10,KJV,to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out
6310,JHN,10,KJV,and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice
6311,JHN,10,KJV,and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers
6312,JHN,10,KJV,this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them
6313,JHN,10,KJV,then said jesus unto them again
6314,JHN,10,KJV,verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep
6315,JHN,10,KJV,all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them
6316,JHN,10,KJV,i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture
6317,JHN,10,KJV,the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have
6318,JHN,10,KJV,it
6319,JHN,10,KJV,more abundantly
6320,JHN,10,KJV,i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep
6321,JHN,10,KJV,but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep
6322,JHN,10,KJV,the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep
6323,JHN,10,KJV,i am the good shepherd and know my
6324,JHN,10,KJV,sheep
6325,JHN,10,KJV,and am known of mine
6326,JHN,10,KJV,as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
6327,JHN,10,KJV,and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold
6328,JHN,10,KJV,and
6329,JHN,10,KJV,one shepherd
6330,JHN,10,KJV,therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again
6331,JHN,10,KJV,no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father
6332,JHN,10,KJV,there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings
6333,JHN,10,KJV,and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him
6334,JHN,10,KJV,others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind
6335,JHN,10,KJV,and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter
6336,JHN,10,KJV,and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch
6337,JHN,10,KJV,then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly
6338,JHN,10,KJV,jesus answered them
6339,JHN,10,KJV,i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me
6340,JHN,10,KJV,but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you
6341,JHN,10,KJV,my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
6342,JHN,10,KJV,and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any
6343,JHN,10,KJV,man
6344,JHN,10,KJV,pluck them out of my hand
6345,JHN,10,KJV,my father which gave
6346,JHN,10,KJV,them
6347,JHN,10,KJV,me is greater than all and no
6348,JHN,10,KJV,man
6349,JHN,10,KJV,is able to pluck
6350,JHN,10,KJV,them
6351,JHN,10,KJV,out of my fathers hand
6352,JHN,10,KJV,i and
6353,JHN,10,KJV,my
6354,JHN,10,KJV,father are one
6355,JHN,10,KJV,then the jews took up stones again to stone him
6356,JHN,10,KJV,jesus answered them
6357,JHN,10,KJV,many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me
6358,JHN,10,KJV,the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god
6359,JHN,10,KJV,jesus answered them
6360,JHN,10,KJV,is it not written in your law i said ye are gods
6361,JHN,10,KJV,if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
6362,JHN,10,KJV,say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god
6363,JHN,10,KJV,if i do not the works of my father believe me not
6364,JHN,10,KJV,but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father
6365,JHN,10,KJV,is
6366,JHN,10,KJV,in me and i in him
6367,JHN,10,KJV,therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand
6368,JHN,10,KJV,and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode
6369,JHN,10,KJV,and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but all things that john spake of this man were true
6370,JHN,10,KJV,and many believed on him there
6371,JHN,11,KJV,now a certain
6372,JHN,11,KJV,man
6373,JHN,11,KJV,was sick
6374,JHN,11,KJV,named
6375,JHN,11,KJV,lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha
6376,JHN,11,KJV,it was
6377,JHN,11,KJV,that
6378,JHN,11,KJV,mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick
6379,JHN,11,KJV,therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick
6380,JHN,11,KJV,when jesus heard
6381,JHN,11,KJV,that
6382,JHN,11,KJV,he said
6383,JHN,11,KJV,this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby
6384,JHN,11,KJV,now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus
6385,JHN,11,KJV,when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was
6386,JHN,11,KJV,then after that saith he to
6387,JHN,11,KJV,his
6388,JHN,11,KJV,disciples
6389,JHN,11,KJV,let us go into judaea again
6390,JHN,11,KJV,his
6391,JHN,11,KJV,disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again
6392,JHN,11,KJV,jesus answered
6393,JHN,11,KJV,are there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world
6394,JHN,11,KJV,but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him
6395,JHN,11,KJV,these things said he and after that he saith unto them
6396,JHN,11,KJV,our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep
6397,JHN,11,KJV,then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well
6398,JHN,11,KJV,howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
6399,JHN,11,KJV,then said jesus unto them plainly
6400,JHN,11,KJV,lazarus is dead
6401,JHN,11,KJV,and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him
6402,JHN,11,KJV,then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him
6403,JHN,11,KJV,then when jesus came he found that he had
6404,JHN,11,KJV,lain
6405,JHN,11,KJV,in the grave four days already
6406,JHN,11,KJV,now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off
6407,JHN,11,KJV,and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother
6408,JHN,11,KJV,then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat
6409,JHN,11,KJV,still
6410,JHN,11,KJV,in the house
6411,JHN,11,KJV,then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
6412,JHN,11,KJV,but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give
6413,JHN,11,KJV,it
6414,JHN,11,KJV,thee
6415,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto her
6416,JHN,11,KJV,thy brother shall rise again
6417,JHN,11,KJV,martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day
6418,JHN,11,KJV,jesus said unto her
6419,JHN,11,KJV,i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
6420,JHN,11,KJV,and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this
6421,JHN,11,KJV,she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world
6422,JHN,11,KJV,and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee
6423,JHN,11,KJV,as soon as she heard
6424,JHN,11,KJV,that
6425,JHN,11,KJV,she arose quickly and came unto him
6426,JHN,11,KJV,now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him
6427,JHN,11,KJV,the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there
6428,JHN,11,KJV,then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
6429,JHN,11,KJV,when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled
6430,JHN,11,KJV,and said
6431,JHN,11,KJV,where have ye laid him
6432,JHN,11,KJV,they said unto him lord come and see
6433,JHN,11,KJV,jesus wept
6434,JHN,11,KJV,then said the jews behold how he loved him
6435,JHN,11,KJV,and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died
6436,JHN,11,KJV,jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
6437,JHN,11,KJV,jesus said
6438,JHN,11,KJV,take ye away the stone
6439,JHN,11,KJV,martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been
6440,JHN,11,KJV,dead
6441,JHN,11,KJV,four days
6442,JHN,11,KJV,jesus saith unto her
6443,JHN,11,KJV,said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god
6444,JHN,11,KJV,then they took away the stone
6445,JHN,11,KJV,from the place
6446,JHN,11,KJV,where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up
6447,JHN,11,KJV,his
6448,JHN,11,KJV,eyes and said
6449,JHN,11,KJV,father i thank thee that thou hast heard me
6450,JHN,11,KJV,and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said
6451,JHN,11,KJV,it
6452,JHN,11,KJV,that they may believe that thou hast sent me
6453,JHN,11,KJV,and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice
6454,JHN,11,KJV,lazarus come forth
6455,JHN,11,KJV,and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them
6456,JHN,11,KJV,loose him and let him go
6457,JHN,11,KJV,then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him
6458,JHN,11,KJV,but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done
6459,JHN,11,KJV,then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man doeth many miracles
6460,JHN,11,KJV,if we let him thus alone all
6461,JHN,11,KJV,men
6462,JHN,11,KJV,will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation
6463,JHN,11,KJV,and one of them
6464,JHN,11,KJV,named
6465,JHN,11,KJV,caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all
6466,JHN,11,KJV,nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not
6467,JHN,11,KJV,and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation
6468,JHN,11,KJV,and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad
6469,JHN,11,KJV,then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death
6470,JHN,11,KJV,jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples
6471,JHN,11,KJV,and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves
6472,JHN,11,KJV,then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast
6473,JHN,11,KJV,now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew
6474,JHN,11,KJV,it
6475,JHN,11,KJV,that they might take him
6476,JHN,12,KJV,then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead
6477,JHN,12,KJV,there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him
6478,JHN,12,KJV,then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment
6479,JHN,12,KJV,then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simons
6480,JHN,12,KJV,son
6481,JHN,12,KJV,which should betray him
6482,JHN,12,KJV,why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor
6483,JHN,12,KJV,this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put therein
6484,JHN,12,KJV,then said jesus
6485,JHN,12,KJV,let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this
6486,JHN,12,KJV,for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always
6487,JHN,12,KJV,much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead
6488,JHN,12,KJV,but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death
6489,JHN,12,KJV,because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus
6490,JHN,12,KJV,on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
6491,JHN,12,KJV,took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed
6492,JHN,12,KJV,is
6493,JHN,12,KJV,the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord
6494,JHN,12,KJV,and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written
6495,JHN,12,KJV,fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an asss colt
6496,JHN,12,KJV,these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and
6497,JHN,12,KJV,that
6498,JHN,12,KJV,they had done these things unto him
6499,JHN,12,KJV,the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record
6500,JHN,12,KJV,for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle
6501,JHN,12,KJV,the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him
6502,JHN,12,KJV,and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast
6503,JHN,12,KJV,the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus
6504,JHN,12,KJV,philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus
6505,JHN,12,KJV,and jesus answered them saying
6506,JHN,12,KJV,the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified
6507,JHN,12,KJV,verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
6508,JHN,12,KJV,he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal
6509,JHN,12,KJV,if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will
6510,JHN,12,KJV,my
6511,JHN,12,KJV,father honour
6512,JHN,12,KJV,now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour
6513,JHN,12,KJV,father glorify thy name
6514,JHN,12,KJV,then came there a voice from heaven
6515,JHN,12,KJV,saying
6516,JHN,12,KJV,i have both glorified
6517,JHN,12,KJV,it
6518,JHN,12,KJV,and will glorify
6519,JHN,12,KJV,it
6520,JHN,12,KJV,again
6521,JHN,12,KJV,the people therefore that stood by and heard
6522,JHN,12,KJV,it
6523,JHN,12,KJV,said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him
6524,JHN,12,KJV,jesus answered and said
6525,JHN,12,KJV,this voice came not because of me but for your sakes
6526,JHN,12,KJV,now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out
6527,JHN,12,KJV,and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all
6528,JHN,12,KJV,men
6529,JHN,12,KJV,unto me
6530,JHN,12,KJV,this he said signifying what death he should die
6531,JHN,12,KJV,the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
6532,JHN,12,KJV,then jesus said unto them
6533,JHN,12,KJV,yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth
6534,JHN,12,KJV,while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light
6535,JHN,12,KJV,these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them
6536,JHN,12,KJV,but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him
6537,JHN,12,KJV,that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake
6538,JHN,12,KJV,lord who hath believed our report
6539,JHN,12,KJV,and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed
6540,JHN,12,KJV,therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again
6541,JHN,12,KJV,he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart
6542,JHN,12,KJV,that they should not see with
6543,JHN,12,KJV,their
6544,JHN,12,KJV,eyes nor understand with
6545,JHN,12,KJV,their
6546,JHN,12,KJV,heart
6547,JHN,12,KJV,and be converted
6548,JHN,12,KJV,and i should heal them
6549,JHN,12,KJV,these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him
6550,JHN,12,KJV,nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess
6551,JHN,12,KJV,him
6552,JHN,12,KJV,lest they should be put out of the synagogue
6553,JHN,12,KJV,for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god
6554,JHN,12,KJV,jesus cried and said
6555,JHN,12,KJV,he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me
6556,JHN,12,KJV,and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
6557,JHN,12,KJV,i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
6558,JHN,12,KJV,and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
6559,JHN,12,KJV,he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day
6560,JHN,12,KJV,for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak
6561,JHN,12,KJV,and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak
6562,JHN,13,KJV,now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end
6563,JHN,13,KJV,and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons
6564,JHN,13,KJV,son
6565,JHN,13,KJV,to betray him
6566,JHN,13,KJV,jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god
6567,JHN,13,KJV,he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself
6568,JHN,13,KJV,after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe
6569,JHN,13,KJV,them
6570,JHN,13,KJV,with the towel wherewith he was girded
6571,JHN,13,KJV,then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet
6572,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him
6573,JHN,13,KJV,what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter
6574,JHN,13,KJV,peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him
6575,JHN,13,KJV,if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me
6576,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also
6577,JHN,13,KJV,my
6578,JHN,13,KJV,hands and
6579,JHN,13,KJV,my
6580,JHN,13,KJV,head
6581,JHN,13,KJV,jesus saith to him
6582,JHN,13,KJV,he that is washed needeth not save to wash
6583,JHN,13,KJV,his
6584,JHN,13,KJV,feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all
6585,JHN,13,KJV,for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean
6586,JHN,13,KJV,so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them
6587,JHN,13,KJV,know ye what i have done to you
6588,JHN,13,KJV,ye call me master and lord and ye say well for
6589,JHN,13,KJV,so
6590,JHN,13,KJV,i am
6591,JHN,13,KJV,if i then
6592,JHN,13,KJV,your
6593,JHN,13,KJV,lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet
6594,JHN,13,KJV,for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you
6595,JHN,13,KJV,verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him
6596,JHN,13,KJV,if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them
6597,JHN,13,KJV,i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me
6598,JHN,13,KJV,now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am
6599,JHN,13,KJV,he
6600,JHN,13,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
6601,JHN,13,KJV,when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said
6602,JHN,13,KJV,verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me
6603,JHN,13,KJV,then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake
6604,JHN,13,KJV,now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved
6605,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake
6606,JHN,13,KJV,he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it
6607,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered
6608,JHN,13,KJV,he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped
6609,JHN,13,KJV,it
6610,JHN,13,KJV,and when he had dipped the sop he gave
6611,JHN,13,KJV,it
6612,JHN,13,KJV,to judas iscariot
6613,JHN,13,KJV,the son
6614,JHN,13,KJV,of simon
6615,JHN,13,KJV,and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him
6616,JHN,13,KJV,that thou doest do quickly
6617,JHN,13,KJV,now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him
6618,JHN,13,KJV,for some
6619,JHN,13,KJV,of them
6620,JHN,13,KJV,thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy
6621,JHN,13,KJV,those things
6622,JHN,13,KJV,that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor
6623,JHN,13,KJV,he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night
6624,JHN,13,KJV,therefore when he was gone out jesus said
6625,JHN,13,KJV,now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him
6626,JHN,13,KJV,if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him
6627,JHN,13,KJV,little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you
6628,JHN,13,KJV,a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another
6629,JHN,13,KJV,by this shall all
6630,JHN,13,KJV,men
6631,JHN,13,KJV,know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another
6632,JHN,13,KJV,simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered him
6633,JHN,13,KJV,whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards
6634,JHN,13,KJV,peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down my life for thy sake
6635,JHN,13,KJV,jesus answered him
6636,JHN,13,KJV,wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice
6637,JHN,14,KJV,let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me
6638,JHN,14,KJV,in my fathers house are many mansions if
6639,JHN,14,KJV,it were
6640,JHN,14,KJV,not
6641,JHN,14,KJV,so
6642,JHN,14,KJV,i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you
6643,JHN,14,KJV,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am
6644,JHN,14,KJV,there
6645,JHN,14,KJV,ye may be also
6646,JHN,14,KJV,and whither i go ye know and the way ye know
6647,JHN,14,KJV,thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way
6648,JHN,14,KJV,jesus saith unto him
6649,JHN,14,KJV,i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
6650,JHN,14,KJV,if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him
6651,JHN,14,KJV,philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us
6652,JHN,14,KJV,jesus saith unto him
6653,JHN,14,KJV,have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou
6654,JHN,14,KJV,then
6655,JHN,14,KJV,shew us the father
6656,JHN,14,KJV,believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
6657,JHN,14,KJV,believe me that i
6658,JHN,14,KJV,am
6659,JHN,14,KJV,in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake
6660,JHN,14,KJV,verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater
6661,JHN,14,KJV,works
6662,JHN,14,KJV,than these shall he do because i go unto my father
6663,JHN,14,KJV,and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son
6664,JHN,14,KJV,if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do
6665,JHN,14,KJV,it
6666,JHN,14,KJV,if ye love me keep my commandments
6667,JHN,14,KJV,and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever
6668,JHN,14,KJV,even
6669,JHN,14,KJV,the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
6670,JHN,14,KJV,i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you
6671,JHN,14,KJV,yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also
6672,JHN,14,KJV,at that day ye shall know that i
6673,JHN,14,KJV,am
6674,JHN,14,KJV,in my father and ye in me and i in you
6675,JHN,14,KJV,he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him
6676,JHN,14,KJV,judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world
6677,JHN,14,KJV,jesus answered and said unto him
6678,JHN,14,KJV,if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
6679,JHN,14,KJV,he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me
6680,JHN,14,KJV,these things have i spoken unto you being
6681,JHN,14,KJV,yet
6682,JHN,14,KJV,present with you
6683,JHN,14,KJV,but the comforter
6684,JHN,14,KJV,which is
6685,JHN,14,KJV,the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you
6686,JHN,14,KJV,peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
6687,JHN,14,KJV,ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come
6688,JHN,14,KJV,again
6689,JHN,14,KJV,unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i
6690,JHN,14,KJV,and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe
6691,JHN,14,KJV,hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me
6692,JHN,14,KJV,but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence
6693,JHN,15,KJV,i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman
6694,JHN,15,KJV,every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every
6695,JHN,15,KJV,branch
6696,JHN,15,KJV,that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit
6697,JHN,15,KJV,now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you
6698,JHN,15,KJV,abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me
6699,JHN,15,KJV,i am the vine ye
6700,JHN,15,KJV,are
6701,JHN,15,KJV,the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
6702,JHN,15,KJV,if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast
6703,JHN,15,KJV,them
6704,JHN,15,KJV,into the fire and they are burned
6705,JHN,15,KJV,if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you
6706,JHN,15,KJV,herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples
6707,JHN,15,KJV,as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love
6708,JHN,15,KJV,if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
6709,JHN,15,KJV,these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and
6710,JHN,15,KJV,that
6711,JHN,15,KJV,your joy might be full
6712,JHN,15,KJV,this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you
6713,JHN,15,KJV,greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
6714,JHN,15,KJV,ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you
6715,JHN,15,KJV,henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you
6716,JHN,15,KJV,ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and
6717,JHN,15,KJV,that
6718,JHN,15,KJV,your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you
6719,JHN,15,KJV,these things i command you that ye love one another
6720,JHN,15,KJV,if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before
6721,JHN,15,KJV,it hated
6722,JHN,15,KJV,you
6723,JHN,15,KJV,if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you
6724,JHN,15,KJV,remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also
6725,JHN,15,KJV,but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me
6726,JHN,15,KJV,if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloke for their sin
6727,JHN,15,KJV,he that hateth me hateth my father also
6728,JHN,15,KJV,if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father
6729,JHN,15,KJV,but
6730,JHN,15,KJV,this cometh to pass
6731,JHN,15,KJV,that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause
6732,JHN,15,KJV,but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father
6733,JHN,15,KJV,even
6734,JHN,15,KJV,the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me
6735,JHN,15,KJV,and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning
6736,JHN,16,KJV,these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended
6737,JHN,16,KJV,they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service
6738,JHN,16,KJV,and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me
6739,JHN,16,KJV,but these things have i told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you
6740,JHN,16,KJV,but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou
6741,JHN,16,KJV,but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart
6742,JHN,16,KJV,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you
6743,JHN,16,KJV,and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
6744,JHN,16,KJV,of sin because they believe not on me
6745,JHN,16,KJV,of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more
6746,JHN,16,KJV,of judgment because the prince of this world is judged
6747,JHN,16,KJV,i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now
6748,JHN,16,KJV,howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear
6749,JHN,16,KJV,that
6750,JHN,16,KJV,shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
6751,JHN,16,KJV,he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew
6752,JHN,16,KJV,it
6753,JHN,16,KJV,unto you
6754,JHN,16,KJV,all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew
6755,JHN,16,KJV,it
6756,JHN,16,KJV,unto you
6757,JHN,16,KJV,a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father
6758,JHN,16,KJV,then said
6759,JHN,16,KJV,some
6760,JHN,16,KJV,of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us
6761,JHN,16,KJV,a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me
6762,JHN,16,KJV,and
6763,JHN,16,KJV,because i go to the father
6764,JHN,16,KJV,they said therefore what is this that he saith
6765,JHN,16,KJV,a little while
6766,JHN,16,KJV,we cannot tell what he saith
6767,JHN,16,KJV,now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them
6768,JHN,16,KJV,do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me
6769,JHN,16,KJV,verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
6770,JHN,16,KJV,a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world
6771,JHN,16,KJV,and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you
6772,JHN,16,KJV,and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give
6773,JHN,16,KJV,it
6774,JHN,16,KJV,you
6775,JHN,16,KJV,hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full
6776,JHN,16,KJV,these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father
6777,JHN,16,KJV,at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you
6778,JHN,16,KJV,for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god
6779,JHN,16,KJV,i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father
6780,JHN,16,KJV,his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb
6781,JHN,16,KJV,now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god
6782,JHN,16,KJV,jesus answered them
6783,JHN,16,KJV,do ye now believe
6784,JHN,16,KJV,behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me
6785,JHN,16,KJV,these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
6786,JHN,17,KJV,these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
6787,JHN,17,KJV,father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee
6788,JHN,17,KJV,as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
6789,JHN,17,KJV,and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
6790,JHN,17,KJV,i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
6791,JHN,17,KJV,and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was
6792,JHN,17,KJV,i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word
6793,JHN,17,KJV,now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee
6794,JHN,17,KJV,for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received
6795,JHN,17,KJV,them
6796,JHN,17,KJV,and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me
6797,JHN,17,KJV,i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine
6798,JHN,17,KJV,and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them
6799,JHN,17,KJV,and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we
6800,JHN,17,KJV,are
6801,JHN,17,KJV,while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled
6802,JHN,17,KJV,and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
6803,JHN,17,KJV,i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
6804,JHN,17,KJV,i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
6805,JHN,17,KJV,they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
6806,JHN,17,KJV,sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth
6807,JHN,17,KJV,as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world
6808,JHN,17,KJV,and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth
6809,JHN,17,KJV,neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word
6810,JHN,17,KJV,that they all may be one as thou father
6811,JHN,17,KJV,art
6812,JHN,17,KJV,in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me
6813,JHN,17,KJV,and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one
6814,JHN,17,KJV,i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me
6815,JHN,17,KJV,father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world
6816,JHN,17,KJV,o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me
6817,JHN,17,KJV,and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare
6818,JHN,17,KJV,it
6819,JHN,17,KJV,that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them
6820,JHN,18,KJV,when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciples
6821,JHN,18,KJV,and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
6822,JHN,18,KJV,judas then having received a band
6823,JHN,18,KJV,of men
6824,JHN,18,KJV,and officers from the chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons
6825,JHN,18,KJV,jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them
6826,JHN,18,KJV,whom seek ye
6827,JHN,18,KJV,they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them
6828,JHN,18,KJV,i am
6829,JHN,18,KJV,he
6830,JHN,18,KJV,and judas also which betrayed him stood with them
6831,JHN,18,KJV,as soon then as he had said unto them i am
6832,JHN,18,KJV,he
6833,JHN,18,KJV,they went backward and fell to the ground
6834,JHN,18,KJV,then asked he them again
6835,JHN,18,KJV,whom seek ye
6836,JHN,18,KJV,and they said jesus of nazareth
6837,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered
6838,JHN,18,KJV,i have told you that i am
6839,JHN,18,KJV,he
6840,JHN,18,KJV,if therefore ye seek me let these go their way
6841,JHN,18,KJV,that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake
6842,JHN,18,KJV,of them which thou gavest me have i lost none
6843,JHN,18,KJV,then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priests servant and cut off his right ear the servants name was malchus
6844,JHN,18,KJV,then said jesus unto peter
6845,JHN,18,KJV,put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it
6846,JHN,18,KJV,then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him
6847,JHN,18,KJV,and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year
6848,JHN,18,KJV,now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people
6849,JHN,18,KJV,and simon peter followed jesus and
6850,JHN,18,KJV,so did
6851,JHN,18,KJV,another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest
6852,JHN,18,KJV,but peter stood at the door without then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter
6853,JHN,18,KJV,then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also
6854,JHN,18,KJV,one
6855,JHN,18,KJV,of this mans disciples he saith i am not
6856,JHN,18,KJV,and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself
6857,JHN,18,KJV,the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine
6858,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered him
6859,JHN,18,KJV,i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing
6860,JHN,18,KJV,why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said
6861,JHN,18,KJV,and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so
6862,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered him
6863,JHN,18,KJV,if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me
6864,JHN,18,KJV,now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest
6865,JHN,18,KJV,and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore unto him art not thou also
6866,JHN,18,KJV,one
6867,JHN,18,KJV,of his disciples he denied
6868,JHN,18,KJV,it
6869,JHN,18,KJV,and said i am not
6870,JHN,18,KJV,one of the servants of the high priest being
6871,JHN,18,KJV,his
6872,JHN,18,KJV,kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him
6873,JHN,18,KJV,peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew
6874,JHN,18,KJV,then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover
6875,JHN,18,KJV,pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man
6876,JHN,18,KJV,they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee
6877,JHN,18,KJV,then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death
6878,JHN,18,KJV,that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die
6879,JHN,18,KJV,then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews
6880,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered him
6881,JHN,18,KJV,sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me
6882,JHN,18,KJV,pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done
6883,JHN,18,KJV,jesus answered
6884,JHN,18,KJV,my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
6885,JHN,18,KJV,pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered
6886,JHN,18,KJV,thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
6887,JHN,18,KJV,pilate saith unto him what is truth
6888,JHN,18,KJV,and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault
6889,JHN,18,KJV,at all
6890,JHN,18,KJV,
6891,JHN,18,KJV,but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews
6892,JHN,18,KJV,then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber
6893,JHN,19,KJV,then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged
6894,JHN,19,KJV,him
6895,JHN,19,KJV,
6896,JHN,19,KJV,and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put
6897,JHN,19,KJV,it
6898,JHN,19,KJV,on his head and they put on him a purple robe
6899,JHN,19,KJV,and said hail king of the jews and they smote him with their hands
6900,JHN,19,KJV,pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him
6901,JHN,19,KJV,then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and
6902,JHN,19,KJV,pilate
6903,JHN,19,KJV,saith unto them behold the man
6904,JHN,19,KJV,when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify
6905,JHN,19,KJV,him
6906,JHN,19,KJV,crucify
6907,JHN,19,KJV,him
6908,JHN,19,KJV,pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify
6909,JHN,19,KJV,him
6910,JHN,19,KJV,for i find no fault in him
6911,JHN,19,KJV,the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god
6912,JHN,19,KJV,when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid
6913,JHN,19,KJV,and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer
6914,JHN,19,KJV,then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee
6915,JHN,19,KJV,jesus answered
6916,JHN,19,KJV,thou couldest have no power
6917,JHN,19,KJV,at all
6918,JHN,19,KJV,against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin
6919,JHN,19,KJV,and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
6920,JHN,19,KJV,when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha
6921,JHN,19,KJV,and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king
6922,JHN,19,KJV,but they cried out away with
6923,JHN,19,KJV,him
6924,JHN,19,KJV,away with
6925,JHN,19,KJV,him
6926,JHN,19,KJV,crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar
6927,JHN,19,KJV,then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified
6928,JHN,19,KJV,and they took jesus and led
6929,JHN,19,KJV,him
6930,JHN,19,KJV,away
6931,JHN,19,KJV,and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called
6932,JHN,19,KJV,the place
6933,JHN,19,KJV,of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha
6934,JHN,19,KJV,where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst
6935,JHN,19,KJV,and pilate wrote a title and put
6936,JHN,19,KJV,it
6937,JHN,19,KJV,on the cross and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
6938,JHN,19,KJV,this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew
6939,JHN,19,KJV,and
6940,JHN,19,KJV,greek
6941,JHN,19,KJV,and
6942,JHN,19,KJV,latin
6943,JHN,19,KJV,then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews
6944,JHN,19,KJV,pilate answered what i have written i have written
6945,JHN,19,KJV,then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also
6946,JHN,19,KJV,his
6947,JHN,19,KJV,coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout
6948,JHN,19,KJV,they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did
6949,JHN,19,KJV,now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister mary the
6950,JHN,19,KJV,wife
6951,JHN,19,KJV,of cleophas and mary magdalene
6952,JHN,19,KJV,when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother
6953,JHN,19,KJV,woman behold thy son
6954,JHN,19,KJV,then saith he to the disciple
6955,JHN,19,KJV,behold thy mother
6956,JHN,19,KJV,and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own
6957,JHN,19,KJV,home
6958,JHN,19,KJV,after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith
6959,JHN,19,KJV,i thirst
6960,JHN,19,KJV,now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put
6961,JHN,19,KJV,it
6962,JHN,19,KJV,upon hyssop and put
6963,JHN,19,KJV,it
6964,JHN,19,KJV,to his mouth
6965,JHN,19,KJV,when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said
6966,JHN,19,KJV,it is finished
6967,JHN,19,KJV,and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost
6968,JHN,19,KJV,the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and
6969,JHN,19,KJV,that
6970,JHN,19,KJV,they might be taken away
6971,JHN,19,KJV,then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him
6972,JHN,19,KJV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs
6973,JHN,19,KJV,but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water
6974,JHN,19,KJV,and he that saw
6975,JHN,19,KJV,it
6976,JHN,19,KJV,bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe
6977,JHN,19,KJV,for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken
6978,JHN,19,KJV,and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced
6979,JHN,19,KJV,and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave
6980,JHN,19,KJV,him
6981,JHN,19,KJV,leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus
6982,JHN,19,KJV,and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound
6983,JHN,19,KJV,weight
6984,JHN,19,KJV,
6985,JHN,19,KJV,then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury
6986,JHN,19,KJV,now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid
6987,JHN,19,KJV,there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation
6988,JHN,19,KJV,day
6989,JHN,19,KJV,for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
6990,JHN,20,KJV,the first
6991,JHN,20,KJV,day
6992,JHN,20,KJV,of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre
6993,JHN,20,KJV,then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him
6994,JHN,20,KJV,peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre
6995,JHN,20,KJV,so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre
6996,JHN,20,KJV,and he stooping down
6997,JHN,20,KJV,and looking in
6998,JHN,20,KJV,saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in
6999,JHN,20,KJV,then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie
7000,JHN,20,KJV,and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself
7001,JHN,20,KJV,then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed
7002,JHN,20,KJV,for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead
7003,JHN,20,KJV,then the disciples went away again unto their own home
7004,JHN,20,KJV,but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down
7005,JHN,20,KJV,and looked
7006,JHN,20,KJV,into the sepulchre
7007,JHN,20,KJV,and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain
7008,JHN,20,KJV,and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him
7009,JHN,20,KJV,and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus
7010,JHN,20,KJV,jesus saith unto her
7011,JHN,20,KJV,woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou
7012,JHN,20,KJV,she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away
7013,JHN,20,KJV,jesus saith unto her
7014,JHN,20,KJV,mary
7015,JHN,20,KJV,she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master
7016,JHN,20,KJV,jesus saith unto her
7017,JHN,20,KJV,touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and
7018,JHN,20,KJV,to
7019,JHN,20,KJV,my god and your god
7020,JHN,20,KJV,mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and
7021,JHN,20,KJV,that
7022,JHN,20,KJV,he had spoken these things unto her
7023,JHN,20,KJV,then the same day at evening being the first
7024,JHN,20,KJV,day
7025,JHN,20,KJV,of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them
7026,JHN,20,KJV,peace
7027,JHN,20,KJV,be
7028,JHN,20,KJV,unto you
7029,JHN,20,KJV,and when he had so said he shewed unto them
7030,JHN,20,KJV,his
7031,JHN,20,KJV,hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord
7032,JHN,20,KJV,then said jesus to them again
7033,JHN,20,KJV,peace
7034,JHN,20,KJV,be
7035,JHN,20,KJV,unto you as
7036,JHN,20,KJV,my
7037,JHN,20,KJV,father hath sent me even so send i you
7038,JHN,20,KJV,and when he had said this he breathed on
7039,JHN,20,KJV,them
7040,JHN,20,KJV,and saith unto them
7041,JHN,20,KJV,receive ye the holy ghost
7042,JHN,20,KJV,whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them
7043,JHN,20,KJV,and
7044,JHN,20,KJV,whose soever
7045,JHN,20,KJV,sins
7046,JHN,20,KJV,ye retain they are retained
7047,JHN,20,KJV,but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came
7048,JHN,20,KJV,the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe
7049,JHN,20,KJV,and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them
7050,JHN,20,KJV,then
7051,JHN,20,KJV,came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said
7052,JHN,20,KJV,peace
7053,JHN,20,KJV,be
7054,JHN,20,KJV,unto you
7055,JHN,20,KJV,then saith he to thomas
7056,JHN,20,KJV,reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust
7057,JHN,20,KJV,it
7058,JHN,20,KJV,into my side and be not faithless but believing
7059,JHN,20,KJV,and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god
7060,JHN,20,KJV,jesus saith unto him
7061,JHN,20,KJV,thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed
7062,JHN,20,KJV,are
7063,JHN,20,KJV,they that have not seen and
7064,JHN,20,KJV,yet
7065,JHN,20,KJV,have believed
7066,JHN,20,KJV,and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book
7067,JHN,20,KJV,but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
7068,JHN,21,KJV,after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he
7069,JHN,21,KJV,himself
7070,JHN,21,KJV,
7071,JHN,21,KJV,there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the
7072,JHN,21,KJV,sons
7073,JHN,21,KJV,of zebedee and two other of his disciples
7074,JHN,21,KJV,simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing
7075,JHN,21,KJV,but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus
7076,JHN,21,KJV,then jesus saith unto them
7077,JHN,21,KJV,children have ye any meat
7078,JHN,21,KJV,they answered him no
7079,JHN,21,KJV,and he said unto them
7080,JHN,21,KJV,cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find
7081,JHN,21,KJV,they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes
7082,JHN,21,KJV,therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt
7083,JHN,21,KJV,his
7084,JHN,21,KJV,fishers coat
7085,JHN,21,KJV,unto him
7086,JHN,21,KJV,for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea
7087,JHN,21,KJV,and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes
7088,JHN,21,KJV,as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread
7089,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them
7090,JHN,21,KJV,bring of the fish which ye have now caught
7091,JHN,21,KJV,simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken
7092,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto them
7093,JHN,21,KJV,come
7094,JHN,21,KJV,and
7095,JHN,21,KJV,dine
7096,JHN,21,KJV,and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord
7097,JHN,21,KJV,jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise
7098,JHN,21,KJV,this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead
7099,JHN,21,KJV,so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter
7100,JHN,21,KJV,simon
7101,JHN,21,KJV,son
7102,JHN,21,KJV,of jonas lovest thou me more than these
7103,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him
7104,JHN,21,KJV,feed my lambs
7105,JHN,21,KJV,he saith to him again the second time
7106,JHN,21,KJV,simon
7107,JHN,21,KJV,son
7108,JHN,21,KJV,of jonas lovest thou me
7109,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him
7110,JHN,21,KJV,feed my sheep
7111,JHN,21,KJV,he saith unto him the third time
7112,JHN,21,KJV,simon
7113,JHN,21,KJV,son
7114,JHN,21,KJV,of jonas lovest thou me
7115,JHN,21,KJV,peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him
7116,JHN,21,KJV,feed my sheep
7117,JHN,21,KJV,verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry
7118,JHN,21,KJV,thee
7119,JHN,21,KJV,whither thou wouldest not
7120,JHN,21,KJV,this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him
7121,JHN,21,KJV,follow me
7122,JHN,21,KJV,then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee
7123,JHN,21,KJV,peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what
7124,JHN,21,KJV,shall
7125,JHN,21,KJV,this man
7126,JHN,21,KJV,do
7127,JHN,21,KJV,
7128,JHN,21,KJV,jesus saith unto him
7129,JHN,21,KJV,if i will that he tarry till i come what
7130,JHN,21,KJV,is that
7131,JHN,21,KJV,to thee follow thou me
7132,JHN,21,KJV,then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but
7133,JHN,21,KJV,if i will that he tarry till i come what
7134,JHN,21,KJV,is that
7135,JHN,21,KJV,to thee
7136,JHN,21,KJV,this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true
7137,JHN,21,KJV,and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen
7138,ACT,1,KJV,the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach
7139,ACT,1,KJV,until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen
7140,ACT,1,KJV,to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
7141,ACT,1,KJV,and being assembled together with
7142,ACT,1,KJV,them
7143,ACT,1,KJV,commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but
7144,ACT,1,KJV,wait for the promise of the father which
7145,ACT,1,KJV,saith he
7146,ACT,1,KJV,
7147,ACT,1,KJV,ye have heard of me
7148,ACT,1,KJV,for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
7149,ACT,1,KJV,when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel
7150,ACT,1,KJV,and he said unto them
7151,ACT,1,KJV,it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power
7152,ACT,1,KJV,but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
7153,ACT,1,KJV,and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight
7154,ACT,1,KJV,and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel
7155,ACT,1,KJV,which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
7156,ACT,1,KJV,then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey
7157,ACT,1,KJV,and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james
7158,ACT,1,KJV,the son
7159,ACT,1,KJV,of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas
7160,ACT,1,KJV,the brother
7161,ACT,1,KJV,of james
7162,ACT,1,KJV,these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren
7163,ACT,1,KJV,and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty
7164,ACT,1,KJV,men
7165,ACT,1,KJV,and
7166,ACT,1,KJV,brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus
7167,ACT,1,KJV,for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry
7168,ACT,1,KJV,now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out
7169,ACT,1,KJV,and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood
7170,ACT,1,KJV,for it is written in the book of psalms
7171,ACT,1,KJV,let his habitation be desolate
7172,ACT,1,KJV,and let no man dwell therein
7173,ACT,1,KJV,and
7174,ACT,1,KJV,his bishoprick let another take
7175,ACT,1,KJV,wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us
7176,ACT,1,KJV,beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
7177,ACT,1,KJV,and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed justus and matthias
7178,ACT,1,KJV,and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts of all
7179,ACT,1,KJV,men
7180,ACT,1,KJV,shew whether of these two thou hast chosen
7181,ACT,1,KJV,that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place
7182,ACT,1,KJV,and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
7183,ACT,2,KJV,and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
7184,ACT,2,KJV,and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
7185,ACT,2,KJV,and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them
7186,ACT,2,KJV,and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
7187,ACT,2,KJV,and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven
7188,ACT,2,KJV,now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language
7189,ACT,2,KJV,and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans
7190,ACT,2,KJV,and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born
7191,ACT,2,KJV,parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia
7192,ACT,2,KJV,phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes
7193,ACT,2,KJV,cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god
7194,ACT,2,KJV,and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this
7195,ACT,2,KJV,others mocking said these men are full of new wine
7196,ACT,2,KJV,but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all
7197,ACT,2,KJV,ye
7198,ACT,2,KJV,that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words
7199,ACT,2,KJV,for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is
7200,ACT,2,KJV,but
7201,ACT,2,KJV,the third hour of the day
7202,ACT,2,KJV,but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel
7203,ACT,2,KJV,and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god
7204,ACT,2,KJV,i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh
7205,ACT,2,KJV,and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy
7206,ACT,2,KJV,and your young men shall see visions
7207,ACT,2,KJV,and your old men shall dream dreams
7208,ACT,2,KJV,and on my servants and on my handmaidens
7209,ACT,2,KJV,i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy
7210,ACT,2,KJV,and i will shew wonders in heaven above
7211,ACT,2,KJV,and signs in the earth beneath
7212,ACT,2,KJV,blood and fire and vapour of smoke
7213,ACT,2,KJV,the sun shall be turned into darkness
7214,ACT,2,KJV,and the moon into blood
7215,ACT,2,KJV,before that great and notable
7216,ACT,2,KJV,day of the lord come
7217,ACT,2,KJV,and it shall come to pass
7218,ACT,2,KJV,that
7219,ACT,2,KJV,whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
7220,ACT,2,KJV,ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know
7221,ACT,2,KJV,him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain
7222,ACT,2,KJV,whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it
7223,ACT,2,KJV,for david speaketh concerning him
7224,ACT,2,KJV,i foresaw the lord always before my face
7225,ACT,2,KJV,for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved
7226,ACT,2,KJV,therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad
7227,ACT,2,KJV,moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope
7228,ACT,2,KJV,because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell
7229,ACT,2,KJV,neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
7230,ACT,2,KJV,thou hast made known to me the ways of life
7231,ACT,2,KJV,thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance
7232,ACT,2,KJV,men
7233,ACT,2,KJV,and
7234,ACT,2,KJV,brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
7235,ACT,2,KJV,therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne
7236,ACT,2,KJV,he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption
7237,ACT,2,KJV,this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
7238,ACT,2,KJV,therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear
7239,ACT,2,KJV,for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself
7240,ACT,2,KJV,the
7241,ACT,2,KJV,lord
7242,ACT,2,KJV,said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
7243,ACT,2,KJV,until i make thy foes thy footstool
7244,ACT,2,KJV,therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ
7245,ACT,2,KJV,now when they heard
7246,ACT,2,KJV,this
7247,ACT,2,KJV,they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men
7248,ACT,2,KJV,and
7249,ACT,2,KJV,brethren what shall we do
7250,ACT,2,KJV,then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
7251,ACT,2,KJV,for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off
7252,ACT,2,KJV,even
7253,ACT,2,KJV,as many as the lord our god shall call
7254,ACT,2,KJV,and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation
7255,ACT,2,KJV,then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added
7256,ACT,2,KJV,unto them
7257,ACT,2,KJV,about three thousand souls
7258,ACT,2,KJV,and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
7259,ACT,2,KJV,and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles
7260,ACT,2,KJV,and all that believed were together and had all things common
7261,ACT,2,KJV,and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all
7262,ACT,2,KJV,men
7263,ACT,2,KJV,as every man had need
7264,ACT,2,KJV,and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart
7265,ACT,2,KJV,praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
7266,ACT,3,KJV,now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer
7267,ACT,3,KJV,being
7268,ACT,3,KJV,the ninth
7269,ACT,3,KJV,hour
7270,ACT,3,KJV,
7271,ACT,3,KJV,and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple
7272,ACT,3,KJV,who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms
7273,ACT,3,KJV,and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us
7274,ACT,3,KJV,and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them
7275,ACT,3,KJV,then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk
7276,ACT,3,KJV,and he took him by the right hand and lifted
7277,ACT,3,KJV,him
7278,ACT,3,KJV,up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength
7279,ACT,3,KJV,and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god
7280,ACT,3,KJV,and all the people saw him walking and praising god
7281,ACT,3,KJV,and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him
7282,ACT,3,KJV,and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons greatly wondering
7283,ACT,3,KJV,and when peter saw
7284,ACT,3,KJV,it
7285,ACT,3,KJV,he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk
7286,ACT,3,KJV,the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let
7287,ACT,3,KJV,him
7288,ACT,3,KJV,go
7289,ACT,3,KJV,but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you
7290,ACT,3,KJV,and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses
7291,ACT,3,KJV,and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all
7292,ACT,3,KJV,and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did
7293,ACT,3,KJV,it
7294,ACT,3,KJV,as
7295,ACT,3,KJV,did
7296,ACT,3,KJV,also your rulers
7297,ACT,3,KJV,but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled
7298,ACT,3,KJV,repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord
7299,ACT,3,KJV,and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you
7300,ACT,3,KJV,whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
7301,ACT,3,KJV,for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
7302,ACT,3,KJV,and it shall come to pass
7303,ACT,3,KJV,that
7304,ACT,3,KJV,every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people
7305,ACT,3,KJV,yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days
7306,ACT,3,KJV,ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed
7307,ACT,3,KJV,unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
7308,ACT,4,KJV,and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them
7309,ACT,4,KJV,being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead
7310,ACT,4,KJV,and they laid hands on them and put
7311,ACT,4,KJV,them
7312,ACT,4,KJV,in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide
7313,ACT,4,KJV,howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand
7314,ACT,4,KJV,and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes
7315,ACT,4,KJV,and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem
7316,ACT,4,KJV,and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this
7317,ACT,4,KJV,then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel
7318,ACT,4,KJV,if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole
7319,ACT,4,KJV,be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead
7320,ACT,4,KJV,even
7321,ACT,4,KJV,by him doth this man stand here before you whole
7322,ACT,4,KJV,this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner
7323,ACT,4,KJV,neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
7324,ACT,4,KJV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus
7325,ACT,4,KJV,and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it
7326,ACT,4,KJV,but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves
7327,ACT,4,KJV,saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them
7328,ACT,4,KJV,is
7329,ACT,4,KJV,manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny
7330,ACT,4,KJV,it
7331,ACT,4,KJV,
7332,ACT,4,KJV,but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name
7333,ACT,4,KJV,and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus
7334,ACT,4,KJV,but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye
7335,ACT,4,KJV,for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
7336,ACT,4,KJV,so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all
7337,ACT,4,KJV,men
7338,ACT,4,KJV,glorified god for that which was done
7339,ACT,4,KJV,for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed
7340,ACT,4,KJV,and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
7341,ACT,4,KJV,and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou
7342,ACT,4,KJV,art
7343,ACT,4,KJV,god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is
7344,ACT,4,KJV,who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said
7345,ACT,4,KJV,why did the heathen rage
7346,ACT,4,KJV,and the people imagine vain things
7347,ACT,4,KJV,the kings of the earth stood up
7348,ACT,4,KJV,and the rulers were gathered together
7349,ACT,4,KJV,against the lord and against his christ
7350,ACT,4,KJV,for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together
7351,ACT,4,KJV,for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done
7352,ACT,4,KJV,and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word
7353,ACT,4,KJV,by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus
7354,ACT,4,KJV,and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness
7355,ACT,4,KJV,and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any
7356,ACT,4,KJV,of them
7357,ACT,4,KJV,that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common
7358,ACT,4,KJV,and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
7359,ACT,4,KJV,neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold
7360,ACT,4,KJV,and laid
7361,ACT,4,KJV,them
7362,ACT,4,KJV,down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
7363,ACT,4,KJV,and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite
7364,ACT,4,KJV,and
7365,ACT,4,KJV,of the country of cyprus
7366,ACT,4,KJV,having land sold
7367,ACT,4,KJV,it
7368,ACT,4,KJV,and brought the money and laid
7369,ACT,4,KJV,it
7370,ACT,4,KJV,at the apostles feet
7371,ACT,5,KJV,but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession
7372,ACT,5,KJV,and kept back
7373,ACT,5,KJV,part
7374,ACT,5,KJV,of the price his wife also being privy
7375,ACT,5,KJV,to it
7376,ACT,5,KJV,and brought a certain part and laid
7377,ACT,5,KJV,it
7378,ACT,5,KJV,at the apostles feet
7379,ACT,5,KJV,but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back
7380,ACT,5,KJV,part
7381,ACT,5,KJV,of the price of the land
7382,ACT,5,KJV,whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god
7383,ACT,5,KJV,and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things
7384,ACT,5,KJV,and the young men arose wound him up and carried
7385,ACT,5,KJV,him
7386,ACT,5,KJV,out and buried
7387,ACT,5,KJV,him
7388,ACT,5,KJV,and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in
7389,ACT,5,KJV,and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much
7390,ACT,5,KJV,then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband
7391,ACT,5,KJV,are
7392,ACT,5,KJV,at the door and shall carry thee out
7393,ACT,5,KJV,then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying
7394,ACT,5,KJV,her
7395,ACT,5,KJV,forth buried
7396,ACT,5,KJV,her
7397,ACT,5,KJV,by her husband
7398,ACT,5,KJV,and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things
7399,ACT,5,KJV,and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomons porch
7400,ACT,5,KJV,and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them
7401,ACT,5,KJV,and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women
7402,ACT,5,KJV,insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid
7403,ACT,5,KJV,them
7404,ACT,5,KJV,on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them
7405,ACT,5,KJV,there came also a multitude
7406,ACT,5,KJV,out
7407,ACT,5,KJV,of the cities round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one
7408,ACT,5,KJV,then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation
7409,ACT,5,KJV,and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison
7410,ACT,5,KJV,but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said
7411,ACT,5,KJV,go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life
7412,ACT,5,KJV,and when they heard
7413,ACT,5,KJV,that
7414,ACT,5,KJV,they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
7415,ACT,5,KJV,but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told
7416,ACT,5,KJV,saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within
7417,ACT,5,KJV,now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow
7418,ACT,5,KJV,then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
7419,ACT,5,KJV,then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned
7420,ACT,5,KJV,and when they had brought them they set
7421,ACT,5,KJV,them
7422,ACT,5,KJV,before the council and the high priest asked them
7423,ACT,5,KJV,saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us
7424,ACT,5,KJV,then peter and the
7425,ACT,5,KJV,other
7426,ACT,5,KJV,apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men
7427,ACT,5,KJV,the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree
7428,ACT,5,KJV,him hath god exalted with his right hand
7429,ACT,5,KJV,to be
7430,ACT,5,KJV,a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
7431,ACT,5,KJV,and we are his witnesses of these things and
7432,ACT,5,KJV,so is
7433,ACT,5,KJV,also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
7434,ACT,5,KJV,when they heard
7435,ACT,5,KJV,that
7436,ACT,5,KJV,they were cut
7437,ACT,5,KJV,to the heart
7438,ACT,5,KJV,and took counsel to slay them
7439,ACT,5,KJV,then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space
7440,ACT,5,KJV,and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men
7441,ACT,5,KJV,for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought
7442,ACT,5,KJV,after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all
7443,ACT,5,KJV,even
7444,ACT,5,KJV,as many as obeyed him were dispersed
7445,ACT,5,KJV,and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought
7446,ACT,5,KJV,but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god
7447,ACT,5,KJV,and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten
7448,ACT,5,KJV,them
7449,ACT,5,KJV,they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go
7450,ACT,5,KJV,and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name
7451,ACT,5,KJV,and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ
7452,ACT,6,KJV,and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration
7453,ACT,6,KJV,then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples
7454,ACT,6,KJV,unto them
7455,ACT,6,KJV,and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables
7456,ACT,6,KJV,wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business
7457,ACT,6,KJV,but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word
7458,ACT,6,KJV,and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch
7459,ACT,6,KJV,whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid
7460,ACT,6,KJV,their
7461,ACT,6,KJV,hands on them
7462,ACT,6,KJV,and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
7463,ACT,6,KJV,and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people
7464,ACT,6,KJV,then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called
7465,ACT,6,KJV,the synagogue
7466,ACT,6,KJV,of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen
7467,ACT,6,KJV,and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake
7468,ACT,6,KJV,then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and
7469,ACT,6,KJV,against
7470,ACT,6,KJV,god
7471,ACT,6,KJV,and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon
7472,ACT,6,KJV,him
7473,ACT,6,KJV,and caught him and brought
7474,ACT,6,KJV,him
7475,ACT,6,KJV,to the council
7476,ACT,6,KJV,and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law
7477,ACT,6,KJV,for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us
7478,ACT,6,KJV,and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
7479,ACT,7,KJV,then said the high priest are these things so
7480,ACT,7,KJV,and he said
7481,ACT,7,KJV,men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran
7482,ACT,7,KJV,and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee
7483,ACT,7,KJV,then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell
7484,ACT,7,KJV,and he gave him none inheritance in it no not
7485,ACT,7,KJV,so much as
7486,ACT,7,KJV,to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when
7487,ACT,7,KJV,as yet
7488,ACT,7,KJV,he had no child
7489,ACT,7,KJV,and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat
7490,ACT,7,KJV,them
7491,ACT,7,KJV,evil four hundred years
7492,ACT,7,KJV,and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place
7493,ACT,7,KJV,and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so
7494,ACT,7,KJV,abraham
7495,ACT,7,KJV,begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac
7496,ACT,7,KJV,begat
7497,ACT,7,KJV,jacob and jacob
7498,ACT,7,KJV,begat
7499,ACT,7,KJV,the twelve patriarchs
7500,ACT,7,KJV,and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him
7501,ACT,7,KJV,and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house
7502,ACT,7,KJV,now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance
7503,ACT,7,KJV,but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out our fathers first
7504,ACT,7,KJV,and at the second
7505,ACT,7,KJV,time
7506,ACT,7,KJV,joseph was made known to his brethren and josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh
7507,ACT,7,KJV,then sent joseph and called his father jacob to
7508,ACT,7,KJV,him
7509,ACT,7,KJV,and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls
7510,ACT,7,KJV,so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers
7511,ACT,7,KJV,and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor
7512,ACT,7,KJV,the father
7513,ACT,7,KJV,of sychem
7514,ACT,7,KJV,but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt
7515,ACT,7,KJV,till another king arose which knew not joseph
7516,ACT,7,KJV,the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live
7517,ACT,7,KJV,in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his fathers house three months
7518,ACT,7,KJV,and when he was cast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son
7519,ACT,7,KJV,and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds
7520,ACT,7,KJV,and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel
7521,ACT,7,KJV,and seeing one
7522,ACT,7,KJV,of them
7523,ACT,7,KJV,suffer wrong he defended
7524,ACT,7,KJV,him
7525,ACT,7,KJV,and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian
7526,ACT,7,KJV,for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not
7527,ACT,7,KJV,and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another
7528,ACT,7,KJV,but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us
7529,ACT,7,KJV,wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday
7530,ACT,7,KJV,then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons
7531,ACT,7,KJV,and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush
7532,ACT,7,KJV,when moses saw
7533,ACT,7,KJV,it
7534,ACT,7,KJV,he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold
7535,ACT,7,KJV,it
7536,ACT,7,KJV,the voice of the lord came unto him
7537,ACT,7,KJV,saying
7538,ACT,7,KJV,i
7539,ACT,7,KJV,am
7540,ACT,7,KJV,the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold
7541,ACT,7,KJV,then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground
7542,ACT,7,KJV,i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them and now come i will send thee into egypt
7543,ACT,7,KJV,this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did god send
7544,ACT,7,KJV,to be
7545,ACT,7,KJV,a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
7546,ACT,7,KJV,he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years
7547,ACT,7,KJV,this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear
7548,ACT,7,KJV,this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and
7549,ACT,7,KJV,with
7550,ACT,7,KJV,our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us
7551,ACT,7,KJV,to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust
7552,ACT,7,KJV,him
7553,ACT,7,KJV,from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt
7554,ACT,7,KJV,saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for
7555,ACT,7,KJV,as for
7556,ACT,7,KJV,this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
7557,ACT,7,KJV,and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands
7558,ACT,7,KJV,then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets
7559,ACT,7,KJV,o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices
7560,ACT,7,KJV,by the space of
7561,ACT,7,KJV,forty years in the wilderness
7562,ACT,7,KJV,yea ye took up the tabernacle of moloch
7563,ACT,7,KJV,and the star of your god remphan
7564,ACT,7,KJV,figures which ye made to worship them
7565,ACT,7,KJV,and i will carry you away beyond babylon
7566,ACT,7,KJV,our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen
7567,ACT,7,KJV,which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david
7568,ACT,7,KJV,who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob
7569,ACT,7,KJV,but solomon built him an house
7570,ACT,7,KJV,howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet
7571,ACT,7,KJV,heaven
7572,ACT,7,KJV,is
7573,ACT,7,KJV,my throne
7574,ACT,7,KJV,and earth
7575,ACT,7,KJV,is
7576,ACT,7,KJV,my footstool
7577,ACT,7,KJV,what house will ye build me saith the lord
7578,ACT,7,KJV,or what
7579,ACT,7,KJV,is
7580,ACT,7,KJV,the place of my rest
7581,ACT,7,KJV,hath not my hand made all these things
7582,ACT,7,KJV,ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers
7583,ACT,7,KJV,did
7584,ACT,7,KJV,so
7585,ACT,7,KJV,do
7586,ACT,7,KJV,ye
7587,ACT,7,KJV,which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers
7588,ACT,7,KJV,who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept
7589,ACT,7,KJV,it
7590,ACT,7,KJV,when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with
7591,ACT,7,KJV,their
7592,ACT,7,KJV,teeth
7593,ACT,7,KJV,but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god
7594,ACT,7,KJV,and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god
7595,ACT,7,KJV,then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord
7596,ACT,7,KJV,and cast
7597,ACT,7,KJV,him
7598,ACT,7,KJV,out of the city and stoned
7599,ACT,7,KJV,him
7600,ACT,7,KJV,and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was saul
7601,ACT,7,KJV,and they stoned stephen calling upon
7602,ACT,7,KJV,god
7603,ACT,7,KJV,and saying lord jesus receive my spirit
7604,ACT,7,KJV,and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep
7605,ACT,8,KJV,and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles
7606,ACT,8,KJV,and devout men carried stephen
7607,ACT,8,KJV,to his burial
7608,ACT,8,KJV,and made great lamentation over him
7609,ACT,8,KJV,as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed
7610,ACT,8,KJV,them
7611,ACT,8,KJV,to prison
7612,ACT,8,KJV,therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word
7613,ACT,8,KJV,then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them
7614,ACT,8,KJV,and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did
7615,ACT,8,KJV,for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed
7616,ACT,8,KJV,with them
7617,ACT,8,KJV,and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed
7618,ACT,8,KJV,and there was great joy in that city
7619,ACT,8,KJV,but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one
7620,ACT,8,KJV,to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god
7621,ACT,8,KJV,and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries
7622,ACT,8,KJV,but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
7623,ACT,8,KJV,then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done
7624,ACT,8,KJV,now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john
7625,ACT,8,KJV,who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost
7626,ACT,8,KJV,for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
7627,ACT,8,KJV,then laid they
7628,ACT,8,KJV,their
7629,ACT,8,KJV,hands on them and they received the holy ghost
7630,ACT,8,KJV,and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money
7631,ACT,8,KJV,saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost
7632,ACT,8,KJV,but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
7633,ACT,8,KJV,thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god
7634,ACT,8,KJV,repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
7635,ACT,8,KJV,for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and
7636,ACT,8,KJV,in
7637,ACT,8,KJV,the bond of iniquity
7638,ACT,8,KJV,then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me
7639,ACT,8,KJV,and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans
7640,ACT,8,KJV,and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert
7641,ACT,8,KJV,and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship
7642,ACT,8,KJV,was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet
7643,ACT,8,KJV,then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot
7644,ACT,8,KJV,and philip ran thither to
7645,ACT,8,KJV,him
7646,ACT,8,KJV,and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest
7647,ACT,8,KJV,and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him
7648,ACT,8,KJV,the place of the scripture which he read was this
7649,ACT,8,KJV,he was led as a sheep to the slaughter
7650,ACT,8,KJV,and like a lamb dumb before his shearer
7651,ACT,8,KJV,so opened he not his mouth
7652,ACT,8,KJV,in his humiliation his judgment was taken away
7653,ACT,8,KJV,and who shall declare his generation
7654,ACT,8,KJV,for his life is taken from the earth
7655,ACT,8,KJV,and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man
7656,ACT,8,KJV,then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus
7657,ACT,8,KJV,and as they went on
7658,ACT,8,KJV,their
7659,ACT,8,KJV,way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see
7660,ACT,8,KJV,here is
7661,ACT,8,KJV,water what doth hinder me to be baptized
7662,ACT,8,KJV,and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
7663,ACT,8,KJV,and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
7664,ACT,8,KJV,and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing
7665,ACT,8,KJV,but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea
7666,ACT,9,KJV,and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest
7667,ACT,9,KJV,and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem
7668,ACT,9,KJV,and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven
7669,ACT,9,KJV,and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him
7670,ACT,9,KJV,saul saul why persecutest thou me
7671,ACT,9,KJV,and he said who art thou lord and the lord said
7672,ACT,9,KJV,i am jesus whom thou persecutest
7673,ACT,9,KJV,it is
7674,ACT,9,KJV,hard for thee to kick against the pricks
7675,ACT,9,KJV,and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do and the lord
7676,ACT,9,KJV,said
7677,ACT,9,KJV,unto him
7678,ACT,9,KJV,arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do
7679,ACT,9,KJV,and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man
7680,ACT,9,KJV,and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought
7681,ACT,9,KJV,him
7682,ACT,9,KJV,into damascus
7683,ACT,9,KJV,and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink
7684,ACT,9,KJV,and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision
7685,ACT,9,KJV,ananias
7686,ACT,9,KJV,and he said behold i
7687,ACT,9,KJV,am here
7688,ACT,9,KJV,lord
7689,ACT,9,KJV,and the lord
7690,ACT,9,KJV,said
7691,ACT,9,KJV,unto him
7692,ACT,9,KJV,arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for
7693,ACT,9,KJV,one
7694,ACT,9,KJV,called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth
7695,ACT,9,KJV,and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting
7696,ACT,9,KJV,his
7697,ACT,9,KJV,hand on him that he might receive his sight
7698,ACT,9,KJV,then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem
7699,ACT,9,KJV,and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name
7700,ACT,9,KJV,but the lord said unto him
7701,ACT,9,KJV,go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel
7702,ACT,9,KJV,for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names sake
7703,ACT,9,KJV,and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord
7704,ACT,9,KJV,even
7705,ACT,9,KJV,jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
7706,ACT,9,KJV,and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized
7707,ACT,9,KJV,and when he had received meat he was strengthened
7708,ACT,9,KJV,then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus
7709,ACT,9,KJV,and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god
7710,ACT,9,KJV,but all that heard
7711,ACT,9,KJV,him
7712,ACT,9,KJV,were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests
7713,ACT,9,KJV,but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ
7714,ACT,9,KJV,and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him
7715,ACT,9,KJV,but their laying await was known of saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him
7716,ACT,9,KJV,then the disciples took him by night and let
7717,ACT,9,KJV,him
7718,ACT,9,KJV,down by the wall in a basket
7719,ACT,9,KJV,and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple
7720,ACT,9,KJV,but barnabas took him and brought
7721,ACT,9,KJV,him
7722,ACT,9,KJV,to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus
7723,ACT,9,KJV,and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem
7724,ACT,9,KJV,and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him
7725,ACT,9,KJV,which
7726,ACT,9,KJV,when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to tarsus
7727,ACT,9,KJV,then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied
7728,ACT,9,KJV,and it came to pass as peter passed throughout all
7729,ACT,9,KJV,quarters
7730,ACT,9,KJV,he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda
7731,ACT,9,KJV,and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy
7732,ACT,9,KJV,and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately
7733,ACT,9,KJV,and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to the lord
7734,ACT,9,KJV,now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which by interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did
7735,ACT,9,KJV,and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid
7736,ACT,9,KJV,her
7737,ACT,9,KJV,in an upper chamber
7738,ACT,9,KJV,and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring
7739,ACT,9,KJV,him
7740,ACT,9,KJV,that he would not delay to come to them
7741,ACT,9,KJV,then peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them
7742,ACT,9,KJV,but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning
7743,ACT,9,KJV,him
7744,ACT,9,KJV,to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up
7745,ACT,9,KJV,and he gave her
7746,ACT,9,KJV,his
7747,ACT,9,KJV,hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her alive
7748,ACT,9,KJV,and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in the lord
7749,ACT,9,KJV,and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner
7750,ACT,10,KJV,there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian
7751,ACT,10,KJV,band
7752,ACT,10,KJV,
7753,ACT,10,KJV,devout
7754,ACT,10,KJV,man
7755,ACT,10,KJV,and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god alway
7756,ACT,10,KJV,he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius
7757,ACT,10,KJV,and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god
7758,ACT,10,KJV,and now send men to joppa and call for
7759,ACT,10,KJV,one
7760,ACT,10,KJV,simon whose surname is peter
7761,ACT,10,KJV,he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do
7762,ACT,10,KJV,and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually
7763,ACT,10,KJV,and when he had declared all
7764,ACT,10,KJV,these
7765,ACT,10,KJV,things unto them he sent them to joppa
7766,ACT,10,KJV,on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour
7767,ACT,10,KJV,and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance
7768,ACT,10,KJV,and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth
7769,ACT,10,KJV,wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
7770,ACT,10,KJV,and there came a voice to him
7771,ACT,10,KJV,rise peter kill and eat
7772,ACT,10,KJV,but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean
7773,ACT,10,KJV,and the voice
7774,ACT,10,KJV,spake
7775,ACT,10,KJV,unto him again the second time
7776,ACT,10,KJV,what god hath cleansed
7777,ACT,10,KJV,that
7778,ACT,10,KJV,call not thou common
7779,ACT,10,KJV,this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven
7780,ACT,10,KJV,now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simons house and stood before the gate
7781,ACT,10,KJV,and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there
7782,ACT,10,KJV,while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee
7783,ACT,10,KJV,arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them
7784,ACT,10,KJV,then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what
7785,ACT,10,KJV,is
7786,ACT,10,KJV,the cause wherefore ye are come
7787,ACT,10,KJV,and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee
7788,ACT,10,KJV,then called he them in and lodged
7789,ACT,10,KJV,them
7790,ACT,10,KJV,and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him
7791,ACT,10,KJV,and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends
7792,ACT,10,KJV,and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped
7793,ACT,10,KJV,him
7794,ACT,10,KJV,
7795,ACT,10,KJV,but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man
7796,ACT,10,KJV,and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together
7797,ACT,10,KJV,and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean
7798,ACT,10,KJV,therefore came i
7799,ACT,10,KJV,unto you
7800,ACT,10,KJV,without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me
7801,ACT,10,KJV,and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing
7802,ACT,10,KJV,and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god
7803,ACT,10,KJV,send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of
7804,ACT,10,KJV,one
7805,ACT,10,KJV,simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee
7806,ACT,10,KJV,immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before god to hear all things that are commanded thee of god
7807,ACT,10,KJV,then peter opened
7808,ACT,10,KJV,his
7809,ACT,10,KJV,mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons
7810,ACT,10,KJV,but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him
7811,ACT,10,KJV,the word which
7812,ACT,10,KJV,god
7813,ACT,10,KJV,sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all
7814,ACT,10,KJV,that word
7815,ACT,10,KJV,i say
7816,ACT,10,KJV,ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached
7817,ACT,10,KJV,how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him
7818,ACT,10,KJV,and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
7819,ACT,10,KJV,him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly
7820,ACT,10,KJV,not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god
7821,ACT,10,KJV,even
7822,ACT,10,KJV,to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
7823,ACT,10,KJV,and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god
7824,ACT,10,KJV,to be
7825,ACT,10,KJV,the judge of quick and dead
7826,ACT,10,KJV,to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
7827,ACT,10,KJV,while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word
7828,ACT,10,KJV,and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost
7829,ACT,10,KJV,for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter
7830,ACT,10,KJV,can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we
7831,ACT,10,KJV,and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days
7832,ACT,11,KJV,and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god
7833,ACT,11,KJV,and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him
7834,ACT,11,KJV,saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them
7835,ACT,11,KJV,but peter rehearsed
7836,ACT,11,KJV,the matter
7837,ACT,11,KJV,from the beginning and expounded
7838,ACT,11,KJV,it
7839,ACT,11,KJV,by order unto them saying
7840,ACT,11,KJV,i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me
7841,ACT,11,KJV,upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
7842,ACT,11,KJV,and i heard a voice saying unto me
7843,ACT,11,KJV,arise peter slay and eat
7844,ACT,11,KJV,but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth
7845,ACT,11,KJV,but the voice answered me again from heaven
7846,ACT,11,KJV,what god hath cleansed
7847,ACT,11,KJV,that
7848,ACT,11,KJV,call not thou common
7849,ACT,11,KJV,and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven
7850,ACT,11,KJV,and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me
7851,ACT,11,KJV,and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans house
7852,ACT,11,KJV,and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter
7853,ACT,11,KJV,who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved
7854,ACT,11,KJV,and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning
7855,ACT,11,KJV,then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said
7856,ACT,11,KJV,john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
7857,ACT,11,KJV,forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as
7858,ACT,11,KJV,he did
7859,ACT,11,KJV,unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god
7860,ACT,11,KJV,when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life
7861,ACT,11,KJV,now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only
7862,ACT,11,KJV,and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord jesus
7863,ACT,11,KJV,and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord
7864,ACT,11,KJV,then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch
7865,ACT,11,KJV,who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord
7866,ACT,11,KJV,for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord
7867,ACT,11,KJV,then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul
7868,ACT,11,KJV,and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch
7869,ACT,11,KJV,and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch
7870,ACT,11,KJV,and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar
7871,ACT,11,KJV,then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea
7872,ACT,11,KJV,which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul
7873,ACT,12,KJV,now about that time herod the king stretched forth
7874,ACT,12,KJV,his
7875,ACT,12,KJV,hands to vex certain of the church
7876,ACT,12,KJV,and he killed james the brother of john with the sword
7877,ACT,12,KJV,and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread
7878,ACT,12,KJV,and when he had apprehended him he put
7879,ACT,12,KJV,him
7880,ACT,12,KJV,in prison and delivered
7881,ACT,12,KJV,him
7882,ACT,12,KJV,to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people
7883,ACT,12,KJV,peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him
7884,ACT,12,KJV,and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison
7885,ACT,12,KJV,and behold the angel of the lord came upon
7886,ACT,12,KJV,him
7887,ACT,12,KJV,and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from
7888,ACT,12,KJV,his
7889,ACT,12,KJV,hands
7890,ACT,12,KJV,and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me
7891,ACT,12,KJV,and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision
7892,ACT,12,KJV,when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him
7893,ACT,12,KJV,and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and
7894,ACT,12,KJV,from
7895,ACT,12,KJV,all the expectation of the people of the jews
7896,ACT,12,KJV,and when he had considered
7897,ACT,12,KJV,the thing
7898,ACT,12,KJV,he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying
7899,ACT,12,KJV,and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda
7900,ACT,12,KJV,and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate
7901,ACT,12,KJV,and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel
7902,ACT,12,KJV,but peter continued knocking and when they had opened
7903,ACT,12,KJV,the door
7904,ACT,12,KJV,and saw him they were astonished
7905,ACT,12,KJV,but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and he departed and went into another place
7906,ACT,12,KJV,now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter
7907,ACT,12,KJV,and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that
7908,ACT,12,KJV,they
7909,ACT,12,KJV,should be put to death and he went down from judaea to caesarea and
7910,ACT,12,KJV,there
7911,ACT,12,KJV,abode
7912,ACT,12,KJV,and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon but they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kings chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by the kings
7913,ACT,12,KJV,country
7914,ACT,12,KJV,
7915,ACT,12,KJV,and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them
7916,ACT,12,KJV,and the people gave a shout
7917,ACT,12,KJV,saying it is
7918,ACT,12,KJV,the voice of a god and not of a man
7919,ACT,12,KJV,and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
7920,ACT,12,KJV,but the word of god grew and multiplied
7921,ACT,12,KJV,and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had fulfilled
7922,ACT,12,KJV,their
7923,ACT,12,KJV,ministry and took with them john whose surname was mark
7924,ACT,13,KJV,now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul
7925,ACT,13,KJV,as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them
7926,ACT,13,KJV,and when they had fasted and prayed and laid
7927,ACT,13,KJV,their
7928,ACT,13,KJV,hands on them they sent
7929,ACT,13,KJV,them
7930,ACT,13,KJV,away
7931,ACT,13,KJV,so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus
7932,ACT,13,KJV,and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had also john to
7933,ACT,13,KJV,their
7934,ACT,13,KJV,minister
7935,ACT,13,KJV,and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name
7936,ACT,13,KJV,was
7937,ACT,13,KJV,barjesus
7938,ACT,13,KJV,which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus a prudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the word of god
7939,ACT,13,KJV,but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith
7940,ACT,13,KJV,then saul who also
7941,ACT,13,KJV,is called
7942,ACT,13,KJV,paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him
7943,ACT,13,KJV,and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief
7944,ACT,13,KJV,thou
7945,ACT,13,KJV,child of the devil
7946,ACT,13,KJV,thou
7947,ACT,13,KJV,enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord
7948,ACT,13,KJV,and now behold the hand of the lord
7949,ACT,13,KJV,is
7950,ACT,13,KJV,upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand
7951,ACT,13,KJV,then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord
7952,ACT,13,KJV,now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem
7953,ACT,13,KJV,but when they departed from perga they came to antioch in pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
7954,ACT,13,KJV,and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying
7955,ACT,13,KJV,ye
7956,ACT,13,KJV,men
7957,ACT,13,KJV,and
7958,ACT,13,KJV,brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on
7959,ACT,13,KJV,then paul stood up and beckoning with
7960,ACT,13,KJV,his
7961,ACT,13,KJV,hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience
7962,ACT,13,KJV,the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it
7963,ACT,13,KJV,and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness
7964,ACT,13,KJV,and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan he divided their land to them by lot
7965,ACT,13,KJV,and after that he gave
7966,ACT,13,KJV,unto them
7967,ACT,13,KJV,judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet
7968,ACT,13,KJV,and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years
7969,ACT,13,KJV,and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the
7970,ACT,13,KJV,son
7971,ACT,13,KJV,of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will
7972,ACT,13,KJV,of this mans seed hath god according to
7973,ACT,13,KJV,his
7974,ACT,13,KJV,promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus
7975,ACT,13,KJV,when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
7976,ACT,13,KJV,and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that i am i am not
7977,ACT,13,KJV,he
7978,ACT,13,KJV,but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of
7979,ACT,13,KJV,his
7980,ACT,13,KJV,feet i am not worthy to loose
7981,ACT,13,KJV,men
7982,ACT,13,KJV,and
7983,ACT,13,KJV,brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent
7984,ACT,13,KJV,for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled
7985,ACT,13,KJV,them
7986,ACT,13,KJV,in condemning
7987,ACT,13,KJV,him
7988,ACT,13,KJV,
7989,ACT,13,KJV,and though they found no cause of death
7990,ACT,13,KJV,in him
7991,ACT,13,KJV,yet desired they pilate that he should be slain
7992,ACT,13,KJV,and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took
7993,ACT,13,KJV,him
7994,ACT,13,KJV,down from the tree and laid
7995,ACT,13,KJV,him
7996,ACT,13,KJV,in a sepulchre
7997,ACT,13,KJV,but god raised him from the dead
7998,ACT,13,KJV,and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people
7999,ACT,13,KJV,and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers
8000,ACT,13,KJV,god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
8001,ACT,13,KJV,and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead
8002,ACT,13,KJV,now
8003,ACT,13,KJV,no more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you the sure mercies of david
8004,ACT,13,KJV,wherefore he saith also in another
8005,ACT,13,KJV,psalm
8006,ACT,13,KJV,thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption
8007,ACT,13,KJV,for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
8008,ACT,13,KJV,but he whom god raised again saw no corruption
8009,ACT,13,KJV,be it known unto you therefore men
8010,ACT,13,KJV,and
8011,ACT,13,KJV,brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins
8012,ACT,13,KJV,and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses
8013,ACT,13,KJV,beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets
8014,ACT,13,KJV,behold ye despisers and wonder and perish
8015,ACT,13,KJV,for i work a work in your days
8016,ACT,13,KJV,a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you
8017,ACT,13,KJV,and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
8018,ACT,13,KJV,now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god
8019,ACT,13,KJV,and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
8020,ACT,13,KJV,but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming
8021,ACT,13,KJV,then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles
8022,ACT,13,KJV,for so hath the lord commanded us
8023,ACT,13,KJV,saying
8024,ACT,13,KJV,i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles
8025,ACT,13,KJV,that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth
8026,ACT,13,KJV,and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed
8027,ACT,13,KJV,and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region
8028,ACT,13,KJV,but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts
8029,ACT,13,KJV,but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium
8030,ACT,13,KJV,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost
8031,ACT,14,KJV,and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed
8032,ACT,14,KJV,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren
8033,ACT,14,KJV,long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands
8034,ACT,14,KJV,but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles
8035,ACT,14,KJV,and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use
8036,ACT,14,KJV,them
8037,ACT,14,KJV,despitefully and to stone them
8038,ACT,14,KJV,they were ware of
8039,ACT,14,KJV,it
8040,ACT,14,KJV,and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about
8041,ACT,14,KJV,and there they preached the gospel
8042,ACT,14,KJV,and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked
8043,ACT,14,KJV,the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed
8044,ACT,14,KJV,said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked
8045,ACT,14,KJV,and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men
8046,ACT,14,KJV,and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker
8047,ACT,14,KJV,then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people
8048,ACT,14,KJV,which
8049,ACT,14,KJV,when the apostles barnabas and paul heard
8050,ACT,14,KJV,of
8051,ACT,14,KJV,they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out
8052,ACT,14,KJV,and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein
8053,ACT,14,KJV,who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways
8054,ACT,14,KJV,nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness
8055,ACT,14,KJV,and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them
8056,ACT,14,KJV,and there came thither
8057,ACT,14,KJV,certain
8058,ACT,14,KJV,jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew
8059,ACT,14,KJV,him
8060,ACT,14,KJV,out of the city supposing he had been dead
8061,ACT,14,KJV,howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe
8062,ACT,14,KJV,and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and
8063,ACT,14,KJV,to
8064,ACT,14,KJV,iconium and antioch
8065,ACT,14,KJV,confirming the souls of the disciples
8066,ACT,14,KJV,and
8067,ACT,14,KJV,exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
8068,ACT,14,KJV,and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed
8069,ACT,14,KJV,and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia
8070,ACT,14,KJV,and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia
8071,ACT,14,KJV,and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled
8072,ACT,14,KJV,and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles
8073,ACT,14,KJV,and there they abode long time with the disciples
8074,ACT,15,KJV,and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren
8075,ACT,15,KJV,and said
8076,ACT,15,KJV,except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved
8077,ACT,15,KJV,when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question
8078,ACT,15,KJV,and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren
8079,ACT,15,KJV,and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and
8080,ACT,15,KJV,of
8081,ACT,15,KJV,the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them
8082,ACT,15,KJV,but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command
8083,ACT,15,KJV,them
8084,ACT,15,KJV,to keep the law of moses
8085,ACT,15,KJV,and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter
8086,ACT,15,KJV,and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men
8087,ACT,15,KJV,and
8088,ACT,15,KJV,brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe
8089,ACT,15,KJV,and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as
8090,ACT,15,KJV,he did
8091,ACT,15,KJV,unto us
8092,ACT,15,KJV,and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith
8093,ACT,15,KJV,now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear
8094,ACT,15,KJV,but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they
8095,ACT,15,KJV,then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them
8096,ACT,15,KJV,and after they had held their peace james answered saying men
8097,ACT,15,KJV,and
8098,ACT,15,KJV,brethren hearken unto me
8099,ACT,15,KJV,simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name
8100,ACT,15,KJV,and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written
8101,ACT,15,KJV,after this i will return
8102,ACT,15,KJV,and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down
8103,ACT,15,KJV,and i will build again the ruins thereof
8104,ACT,15,KJV,and i will set it up
8105,ACT,15,KJV,that the residue of men might seek after the lord
8106,ACT,15,KJV,and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called
8107,ACT,15,KJV,saith the lord who doeth all these things
8108,ACT,15,KJV,known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world
8109,ACT,15,KJV,wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god
8110,ACT,15,KJV,but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and
8111,ACT,15,KJV,from
8112,ACT,15,KJV,fornication and
8113,ACT,15,KJV,from
8114,ACT,15,KJV,things strangled and
8115,ACT,15,KJV,from
8116,ACT,15,KJV,blood
8117,ACT,15,KJV,for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day
8118,ACT,15,KJV,then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas
8119,ACT,15,KJV,namely
8120,ACT,15,KJV,judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren
8121,ACT,15,KJV,and they wrote
8122,ACT,15,KJV,letters
8123,ACT,15,KJV,by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren
8124,ACT,15,KJV,send
8125,ACT,15,KJV,greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia
8126,ACT,15,KJV,forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying
8127,ACT,15,KJV,ye must
8128,ACT,15,KJV,be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no
8129,ACT,15,KJV,such
8130,ACT,15,KJV,commandment
8131,ACT,15,KJV,it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul
8132,ACT,15,KJV,men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
8133,ACT,15,KJV,we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell
8134,ACT,15,KJV,you
8135,ACT,15,KJV,the same things by mouth
8136,ACT,15,KJV,for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things
8137,ACT,15,KJV,that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
8138,ACT,15,KJV,so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle
8139,ACT,15,KJV,which
8140,ACT,15,KJV,when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation
8141,ACT,15,KJV,and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed
8142,ACT,15,KJV,them
8143,ACT,15,KJV,
8144,ACT,15,KJV,and after they had tarried
8145,ACT,15,KJV,there
8146,ACT,15,KJV,a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles
8147,ACT,15,KJV,notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still
8148,ACT,15,KJV,paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also
8149,ACT,15,KJV,and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord
8150,ACT,15,KJV,and see
8151,ACT,15,KJV,how they do
8152,ACT,15,KJV,and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark
8153,ACT,15,KJV,but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work
8154,ACT,15,KJV,and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus
8155,ACT,15,KJV,and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god
8156,ACT,15,KJV,and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches
8157,ACT,16,KJV,then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father
8158,ACT,16,KJV,was
8159,ACT,16,KJV,a greek
8160,ACT,16,KJV,which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium
8161,ACT,16,KJV,him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek
8162,ACT,16,KJV,and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem
8163,ACT,16,KJV,and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily
8164,ACT,16,KJV,now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia
8165,ACT,16,KJV,after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not
8166,ACT,16,KJV,and they passing by mysia came down to troas
8167,ACT,16,KJV,and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us
8168,ACT,16,KJV,and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them
8169,ACT,16,KJV,therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next
8170,ACT,16,KJV,day
8171,ACT,16,KJV,to neapolis
8172,ACT,16,KJV,and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia
8173,ACT,16,KJV,and
8174,ACT,16,KJV,a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days
8175,ACT,16,KJV,and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted
8176,ACT,16,KJV,thither
8177,ACT,16,KJV,and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard
8178,ACT,16,KJV,us
8179,ACT,16,KJV,whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul
8180,ACT,16,KJV,and when she was baptized and her household she besought
8181,ACT,16,KJV,us
8182,ACT,16,KJV,saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide
8183,ACT,16,KJV,there
8184,ACT,16,KJV,and she constrained us
8185,ACT,16,KJV,and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying
8186,ACT,16,KJV,the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation
8187,ACT,16,KJV,and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour
8188,ACT,16,KJV,and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew
8189,ACT,16,KJV,them
8190,ACT,16,KJV,into the marketplace unto the rulers
8191,ACT,16,KJV,and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city
8192,ACT,16,KJV,and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans
8193,ACT,16,KJV,and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat
8194,ACT,16,KJV,them
8195,ACT,16,KJV,
8196,ACT,16,KJV,and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast
8197,ACT,16,KJV,them
8198,ACT,16,KJV,into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely
8199,ACT,16,KJV,who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks
8200,ACT,16,KJV,and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them
8201,ACT,16,KJV,and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed
8202,ACT,16,KJV,and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled
8203,ACT,16,KJV,but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here
8204,ACT,16,KJV,then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas
8205,ACT,16,KJV,and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved
8206,ACT,16,KJV,and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house
8207,ACT,16,KJV,and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house
8208,ACT,16,KJV,and he took them the same hour of the night and washed
8209,ACT,16,KJV,their
8210,ACT,16,KJV,stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway
8211,ACT,16,KJV,and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house
8212,ACT,16,KJV,and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go
8213,ACT,16,KJV,and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace
8214,ACT,16,KJV,but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast
8215,ACT,16,KJV,us
8216,ACT,16,KJV,into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out
8217,ACT,16,KJV,and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans
8218,ACT,16,KJV,and they came and besought them and brought
8219,ACT,16,KJV,them
8220,ACT,16,KJV,out and desired
8221,ACT,16,KJV,them
8222,ACT,16,KJV,to depart out of the city
8223,ACT,16,KJV,and they went out of the prison and entered into
8224,ACT,16,KJV,the house of
8225,ACT,16,KJV,lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed
8226,ACT,17,KJV,now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews
8227,ACT,17,KJV,and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
8228,ACT,17,KJV,opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ
8229,ACT,17,KJV,and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few
8230,ACT,17,KJV,but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people
8231,ACT,17,KJV,and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also
8232,ACT,17,KJV,whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king
8233,ACT,17,KJV,one
8234,ACT,17,KJV,jesus
8235,ACT,17,KJV,and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things
8236,ACT,17,KJV,and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go
8237,ACT,17,KJV,and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming
8238,ACT,17,KJV,thither
8239,ACT,17,KJV,went into the synagogue of the jews
8240,ACT,17,KJV,these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so
8241,ACT,17,KJV,therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few
8242,ACT,17,KJV,but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people
8243,ACT,17,KJV,and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still
8244,ACT,17,KJV,and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed
8245,ACT,17,KJV,now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry
8246,ACT,17,KJV,therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him
8247,ACT,17,KJV,then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him and some said what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection
8248,ACT,17,KJV,and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest
8249,ACT,17,KJV,is
8250,ACT,17,KJV,
8251,ACT,17,KJV,for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean
8252,ACT,17,KJV,for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing
8253,ACT,17,KJV,then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said
8254,ACT,17,KJV,ye
8255,ACT,17,KJV,men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious
8256,ACT,17,KJV,for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you
8257,ACT,17,KJV,god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands
8258,ACT,17,KJV,neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things
8259,ACT,17,KJV,and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation
8260,ACT,17,KJV,that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us
8261,ACT,17,KJV,for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring
8262,ACT,17,KJV,forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and mans device
8263,ACT,17,KJV,and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent
8264,ACT,17,KJV,because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by
8265,ACT,17,KJV,that
8266,ACT,17,KJV,man whom he hath ordained
8267,ACT,17,KJV,whereof
8268,ACT,17,KJV,he hath given assurance unto all
8269,ACT,17,KJV,men
8270,ACT,17,KJV,in that he hath raised him from the dead
8271,ACT,17,KJV,and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this
8272,ACT,17,KJV,matter
8273,ACT,17,KJV,
8274,ACT,17,KJV,so paul departed from among them
8275,ACT,17,KJV,howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which
8276,ACT,17,KJV,was
8277,ACT,17,KJV,dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
8278,ACT,18,KJV,after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth
8279,ACT,18,KJV,and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them
8280,ACT,18,KJV,and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers
8281,ACT,18,KJV,and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
8282,ACT,18,KJV,and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews
8283,ACT,18,KJV,that
8284,ACT,18,KJV,jesus
8285,ACT,18,KJV,was
8286,ACT,18,KJV,christ
8287,ACT,18,KJV,and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook
8288,ACT,18,KJV,his
8289,ACT,18,KJV,raiment and said unto them your blood
8290,ACT,18,KJV,be
8291,ACT,18,KJV,upon your own heads i
8292,ACT,18,KJV,am
8293,ACT,18,KJV,clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles
8294,ACT,18,KJV,and he departed thence and entered into a certain
8295,ACT,18,KJV,mans
8296,ACT,18,KJV,house named justus
8297,ACT,18,KJV,one
8298,ACT,18,KJV,that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue
8299,ACT,18,KJV,and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized
8300,ACT,18,KJV,then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision
8301,ACT,18,KJV,be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace
8302,ACT,18,KJV,for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city
8303,ACT,18,KJV,and he continued
8304,ACT,18,KJV,there
8305,ACT,18,KJV,a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
8306,ACT,18,KJV,and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat
8307,ACT,18,KJV,saying this
8308,ACT,18,KJV,fellow
8309,ACT,18,KJV,persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law
8310,ACT,18,KJV,and when paul was now about to open
8311,ACT,18,KJV,his
8312,ACT,18,KJV,mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o
8313,ACT,18,KJV,ye
8314,ACT,18,KJV,jews reason would that i should bear with you
8315,ACT,18,KJV,but if it be a question of words and names and
8316,ACT,18,KJV,of
8317,ACT,18,KJV,your law look ye
8318,ACT,18,KJV,to it
8319,ACT,18,KJV,for i will be no judge of such
8320,ACT,18,KJV,matters
8321,ACT,18,KJV,
8322,ACT,18,KJV,and he drave them from the judgment seat
8323,ACT,18,KJV,then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat
8324,ACT,18,KJV,him
8325,ACT,18,KJV,before the judgment seat and gallio cared for none of those things
8326,ACT,18,KJV,and paul
8327,ACT,18,KJV,after this
8328,ACT,18,KJV,tarried
8329,ACT,18,KJV,there
8330,ACT,18,KJV,yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn
8331,ACT,18,KJV,his
8332,ACT,18,KJV,head in cenchrea for he had a vow
8333,ACT,18,KJV,and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews
8334,ACT,18,KJV,when they desired
8335,ACT,18,KJV,him
8336,ACT,18,KJV,to tarry longer time with them he consented not
8337,ACT,18,KJV,but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus
8338,ACT,18,KJV,and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch
8339,ACT,18,KJV,and after he had spent some time
8340,ACT,18,KJV,there
8341,ACT,18,KJV,he departed and went over
8342,ACT,18,KJV,all
8343,ACT,18,KJV,the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples
8344,ACT,18,KJV,and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man
8345,ACT,18,KJV,and
8346,ACT,18,KJV,mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus
8347,ACT,18,KJV,this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john
8348,ACT,18,KJV,and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto
8349,ACT,18,KJV,them
8350,ACT,18,KJV,and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly
8351,ACT,18,KJV,and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace
8352,ACT,18,KJV,for he mightily convinced the jews
8353,ACT,18,KJV,and that
8354,ACT,18,KJV,publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ
8355,ACT,19,KJV,and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples
8356,ACT,19,KJV,he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
8357,ACT,19,KJV,and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism
8358,ACT,19,KJV,then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus
8359,ACT,19,KJV,when they heard
8360,ACT,19,KJV,this
8361,ACT,19,KJV,they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
8362,ACT,19,KJV,and when paul had laid
8363,ACT,19,KJV,his
8364,ACT,19,KJV,hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
8365,ACT,19,KJV,and all the men were about twelve
8366,ACT,19,KJV,and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
8367,ACT,19,KJV,but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus
8368,ACT,19,KJV,and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks
8369,ACT,19,KJV,and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul
8370,ACT,19,KJV,so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them
8371,ACT,19,KJV,then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth
8372,ACT,19,KJV,and there were seven sons of
8373,ACT,19,KJV,one
8374,ACT,19,KJV,sceva a jew
8375,ACT,19,KJV,and
8376,ACT,19,KJV,chief of the priests which did so
8377,ACT,19,KJV,and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye
8378,ACT,19,KJV,and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
8379,ACT,19,KJV,and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified
8380,ACT,19,KJV,and many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deeds
8381,ACT,19,KJV,many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all
8382,ACT,19,KJV,men
8383,ACT,19,KJV,and they counted the price of them and found
8384,ACT,19,KJV,it
8385,ACT,19,KJV,fifty thousand
8386,ACT,19,KJV,pieces
8387,ACT,19,KJV,of silver
8388,ACT,19,KJV,so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed
8389,ACT,19,KJV,after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome
8390,ACT,19,KJV,so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season
8391,ACT,19,KJV,and the same time there arose no small stir about that way
8392,ACT,19,KJV,for a certain
8393,ACT,19,KJV,man
8394,ACT,19,KJV,named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen
8395,ACT,19,KJV,whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth
8396,ACT,19,KJV,moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands
8397,ACT,19,KJV,so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth
8398,ACT,19,KJV,and when they heard
8399,ACT,19,KJV,these sayings
8400,ACT,19,KJV,they were full of wrath and cried out saying great
8401,ACT,19,KJV,is
8402,ACT,19,KJV,diana of the ephesians
8403,ACT,19,KJV,and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre
8404,ACT,19,KJV,and when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not
8405,ACT,19,KJV,and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring
8406,ACT,19,KJV,him
8407,ACT,19,KJV,that he would not adventure himself into the theatre
8408,ACT,19,KJV,some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together
8409,ACT,19,KJV,and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people
8410,ACT,19,KJV,but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great
8411,ACT,19,KJV,is
8412,ACT,19,KJV,diana of the ephesians
8413,ACT,19,KJV,and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said
8414,ACT,19,KJV,ye
8415,ACT,19,KJV,men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the
8416,ACT,19,KJV,image
8417,ACT,19,KJV,which fell down from jupiter
8418,ACT,19,KJV,seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly
8419,ACT,19,KJV,for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess
8420,ACT,19,KJV,wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another
8421,ACT,19,KJV,but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly
8422,ACT,19,KJV,for we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse
8423,ACT,19,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly
8424,ACT,20,KJV,and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto
8425,ACT,20,KJV,him
8426,ACT,20,KJV,the disciples and embraced
8427,ACT,20,KJV,them
8428,ACT,20,KJV,and departed for to go into macedonia
8429,ACT,20,KJV,and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece
8430,ACT,20,KJV,and
8431,ACT,20,KJV,there
8432,ACT,20,KJV,abode three months and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia
8433,ACT,20,KJV,and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus
8434,ACT,20,KJV,these going before tarried for us at troas
8435,ACT,20,KJV,and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days
8436,ACT,20,KJV,and upon the first
8437,ACT,20,KJV,day
8438,ACT,20,KJV,of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
8439,ACT,20,KJV,and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together
8440,ACT,20,KJV,and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead
8441,ACT,20,KJV,and paul went down and fell on him and embracing
8442,ACT,20,KJV,him
8443,ACT,20,KJV,said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him
8444,ACT,20,KJV,when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed
8445,ACT,20,KJV,and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted
8446,ACT,20,KJV,and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot
8447,ACT,20,KJV,and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene
8448,ACT,20,KJV,and we sailed thence and came the next
8449,ACT,20,KJV,day
8450,ACT,20,KJV,over against chios and the next
8451,ACT,20,KJV,day
8452,ACT,20,KJV,we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next
8453,ACT,20,KJV,day
8454,ACT,20,KJV,we came to miletus
8455,ACT,20,KJV,for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost
8456,ACT,20,KJV,and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church
8457,ACT,20,KJV,and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons
8458,ACT,20,KJV,serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews
8459,ACT,20,KJV,and
8460,ACT,20,KJV,how i kept back nothing that was profitable
8461,ACT,20,KJV,unto you
8462,ACT,20,KJV,but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house
8463,ACT,20,KJV,testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
8464,ACT,20,KJV,and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there
8465,ACT,20,KJV,save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me
8466,ACT,20,KJV,but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god
8467,ACT,20,KJV,and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
8468,ACT,20,KJV,wherefore i take you to record this day that i
8469,ACT,20,KJV,am
8470,ACT,20,KJV,pure from the blood of all
8471,ACT,20,KJV,men
8472,ACT,20,KJV,
8473,ACT,20,KJV,for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god
8474,ACT,20,KJV,take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood
8475,ACT,20,KJV,for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock
8476,ACT,20,KJV,also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them
8477,ACT,20,KJV,therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears
8478,ACT,20,KJV,and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified
8479,ACT,20,KJV,i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel
8480,ACT,20,KJV,yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me
8481,ACT,20,KJV,i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said
8482,ACT,20,KJV,it is more blessed to give than to receive
8483,ACT,20,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all
8484,ACT,20,KJV,and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him
8485,ACT,20,KJV,sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship
8486,ACT,21,KJV,and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the
8487,ACT,21,KJV,day
8488,ACT,21,KJV,following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara
8489,ACT,21,KJV,and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth
8490,ACT,21,KJV,now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden
8491,ACT,21,KJV,and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem
8492,ACT,21,KJV,and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till
8493,ACT,21,KJV,we were
8494,ACT,21,KJV,out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed
8495,ACT,21,KJV,and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and they returned home again
8496,ACT,21,KJV,and when we had finished
8497,ACT,21,KJV,our
8498,ACT,21,KJV,course from tyre we came to ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day
8499,ACT,21,KJV,and the next
8500,ACT,21,KJV,day
8501,ACT,21,KJV,we that were of pauls company departed and came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was
8502,ACT,21,KJV,one
8503,ACT,21,KJV,of the seven and abode with him
8504,ACT,21,KJV,and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy
8505,ACT,21,KJV,and as we tarried
8506,ACT,21,KJV,there
8507,ACT,21,KJV,many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus
8508,ACT,21,KJV,and when he was come unto us he took pauls girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver
8509,ACT,21,KJV,him
8510,ACT,21,KJV,into the hands of the gentiles
8511,ACT,21,KJV,and when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem
8512,ACT,21,KJV,then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
8513,ACT,21,KJV,and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done
8514,ACT,21,KJV,and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem
8515,ACT,21,KJV,there went with us also
8516,ACT,21,KJV,certain
8517,ACT,21,KJV,of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge
8518,ACT,21,KJV,and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly
8519,ACT,21,KJV,and the
8520,ACT,21,KJV,day
8521,ACT,21,KJV,following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present
8522,ACT,21,KJV,and when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry
8523,ACT,21,KJV,and when they heard
8524,ACT,21,KJV,it
8525,ACT,21,KJV,they glorified the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the law
8526,ACT,21,KJV,and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise
8527,ACT,21,KJV,their
8528,ACT,21,KJV,children neither to walk after the customs
8529,ACT,21,KJV,what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come
8530,ACT,21,KJV,do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them
8531,ACT,21,KJV,them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave
8532,ACT,21,KJV,their
8533,ACT,21,KJV,heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but
8534,ACT,21,KJV,that
8535,ACT,21,KJV,thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law
8536,ACT,21,KJV,as touching the gentiles which believe we have written
8537,ACT,21,KJV,and
8538,ACT,21,KJV,concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from
8539,ACT,21,KJV,things
8540,ACT,21,KJV,offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornication
8541,ACT,21,KJV,then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them
8542,ACT,21,KJV,and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him
8543,ACT,21,KJV,crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all
8544,ACT,21,KJV,men
8545,ACT,21,KJV,every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place
8546,ACT,21,KJV,for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple
8547,ACT,21,KJV,and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut
8548,ACT,21,KJV,and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar
8549,ACT,21,KJV,who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul
8550,ACT,21,KJV,then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded
8551,ACT,21,KJV,him
8552,ACT,21,KJV,to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done
8553,ACT,21,KJV,and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castle
8554,ACT,21,KJV,and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people
8555,ACT,21,KJV,for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with him
8556,ACT,21,KJV,and as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief captain may i speak unto thee who said canst thou speak greek
8557,ACT,21,KJV,art not thou that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers
8558,ACT,21,KJV,but paul said i am a man
8559,ACT,21,KJV,which am
8560,ACT,21,KJV,a jew of tarsus
8561,ACT,21,KJV,a city
8562,ACT,21,KJV,in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people
8563,ACT,21,KJV,and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spake unto
8564,ACT,21,KJV,them
8565,ACT,21,KJV,in the hebrew tongue saying
8566,ACT,22,KJV,men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence
8567,ACT,22,KJV,which i make
8568,ACT,22,KJV,now unto you
8569,ACT,22,KJV,and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith
8570,ACT,22,KJV,i am verily a man
8571,ACT,22,KJV,which am
8572,ACT,22,KJV,a jew born in tarsus
8573,ACT,22,KJV,a city
8574,ACT,22,KJV,in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel
8575,ACT,22,KJV,and
8576,ACT,22,KJV,taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day
8577,ACT,22,KJV,and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women
8578,ACT,22,KJV,as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished
8579,ACT,22,KJV,and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me
8580,ACT,22,KJV,and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me
8581,ACT,22,KJV,saul saul why persecutest thou me
8582,ACT,22,KJV,and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me
8583,ACT,22,KJV,i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest
8584,ACT,22,KJV,and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
8585,ACT,22,KJV,and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me
8586,ACT,22,KJV,arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do
8587,ACT,22,KJV,and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus
8588,ACT,22,KJV,and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt
8589,ACT,22,KJV,there
8590,ACT,22,KJV,
8591,ACT,22,KJV,came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him
8592,ACT,22,KJV,and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth
8593,ACT,22,KJV,for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard
8594,ACT,22,KJV,and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
8595,ACT,22,KJV,and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance
8596,ACT,22,KJV,and saw him saying unto me
8597,ACT,22,KJV,make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me
8598,ACT,22,KJV,and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee
8599,ACT,22,KJV,and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him
8600,ACT,22,KJV,and he said unto me
8601,ACT,22,KJV,depart for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles
8602,ACT,22,KJV,and they gave him audience unto this word and
8603,ACT,22,KJV,then
8604,ACT,22,KJV,lifted up their voices and said away with such a
8605,ACT,22,KJV,fellow
8606,ACT,22,KJV,from the earth for it is not fit that he should live
8607,ACT,22,KJV,and as they cried out and cast off
8608,ACT,22,KJV,their
8609,ACT,22,KJV,clothes and threw dust into the air
8610,ACT,22,KJV,the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him
8611,ACT,22,KJV,and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned
8612,ACT,22,KJV,when the centurion heard
8613,ACT,22,KJV,that
8614,ACT,22,KJV,he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman
8615,ACT,22,KJV,then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea
8616,ACT,22,KJV,and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom and paul said but i was free born
8617,ACT,22,KJV,then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him
8618,ACT,22,KJV,on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from
8619,ACT,22,KJV,his
8620,ACT,22,KJV,bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them
8621,ACT,23,KJV,and paul earnestly beholding the council said men
8622,ACT,23,KJV,and
8623,ACT,23,KJV,brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day
8624,ACT,23,KJV,and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth
8625,ACT,23,KJV,then said paul unto him god shall smite thee
8626,ACT,23,KJV,thou
8627,ACT,23,KJV,whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law
8628,ACT,23,KJV,and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest
8629,ACT,23,KJV,then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people
8630,ACT,23,KJV,but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men
8631,ACT,23,KJV,and
8632,ACT,23,KJV,brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question
8633,ACT,23,KJV,and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided
8634,ACT,23,KJV,for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both
8635,ACT,23,KJV,and there arose a great cry and the scribes
8636,ACT,23,KJV,that were
8637,ACT,23,KJV,of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god
8638,ACT,23,KJV,and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring
8639,ACT,23,KJV,him
8640,ACT,23,KJV,into the castle
8641,ACT,23,KJV,and the night following the lord stood by him and said
8642,ACT,23,KJV,be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome
8643,ACT,23,KJV,and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul
8644,ACT,23,KJV,and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy
8645,ACT,23,KJV,and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul
8646,ACT,23,KJV,now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him
8647,ACT,23,KJV,and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul
8648,ACT,23,KJV,then paul called one of the centurions unto
8649,ACT,23,KJV,him
8650,ACT,23,KJV,and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him
8651,ACT,23,KJV,so he took him and brought
8652,ACT,23,KJV,him
8653,ACT,23,KJV,to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto
8654,ACT,23,KJV,him
8655,ACT,23,KJV,and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee
8656,ACT,23,KJV,then the chief captain took him by the hand and went
8657,ACT,23,KJV,with him
8658,ACT,23,KJV,aside privately and asked
8659,ACT,23,KJV,him
8660,ACT,23,KJV,what is that thou hast to tell me
8661,ACT,23,KJV,and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly
8662,ACT,23,KJV,but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee
8663,ACT,23,KJV,so the chief captain
8664,ACT,23,KJV,then
8665,ACT,23,KJV,let the young man depart and charged
8666,ACT,23,KJV,him see thou
8667,ACT,23,KJV,tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me
8668,ACT,23,KJV,and he called unto
8669,ACT,23,KJV,him
8670,ACT,23,KJV,two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night
8671,ACT,23,KJV,and provide
8672,ACT,23,KJV,them
8673,ACT,23,KJV,beasts that they may set paul on and bring
8674,ACT,23,KJV,him
8675,ACT,23,KJV,safe unto felix the governor
8676,ACT,23,KJV,and he wrote a letter after this manner
8677,ACT,23,KJV,claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix
8678,ACT,23,KJV,sendeth
8679,ACT,23,KJV,greeting
8680,ACT,23,KJV,this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman
8681,ACT,23,KJV,and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council
8682,ACT,23,KJV,whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds
8683,ACT,23,KJV,and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what
8684,ACT,23,KJV,they had
8685,ACT,23,KJV,against him farewell
8686,ACT,23,KJV,then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought
8687,ACT,23,KJV,him
8688,ACT,23,KJV,by night to antipatris
8689,ACT,23,KJV,on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle
8690,ACT,23,KJV,who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him
8691,ACT,23,KJV,and when the governor had read
8692,ACT,23,KJV,the letter
8693,ACT,23,KJV,he asked of what province he was and when he understood that
8694,ACT,23,KJV,he was
8695,ACT,23,KJV,of cilicia
8696,ACT,23,KJV,i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall
8697,ACT,24,KJV,and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and
8698,ACT,24,KJV,with
8699,ACT,24,KJV,a certain orator
8700,ACT,24,KJV,named
8701,ACT,24,KJV,tertullus who informed the governor against paul
8702,ACT,24,KJV,and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse
8703,ACT,24,KJV,him
8704,ACT,24,KJV,saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence
8705,ACT,24,KJV,we accept
8706,ACT,24,KJV,it
8707,ACT,24,KJV,always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness
8708,ACT,24,KJV,notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words
8709,ACT,24,KJV,for we have found this man
8710,ACT,24,KJV,pestilent
8711,ACT,24,KJV,fellow
8712,ACT,24,KJV,and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
8713,ACT,24,KJV,who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law
8714,ACT,24,KJV,but the chief captain lysias came
8715,ACT,24,KJV,upon us
8716,ACT,24,KJV,and with great violence took
8717,ACT,24,KJV,him
8718,ACT,24,KJV,away out of our hands
8719,ACT,24,KJV,commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him
8720,ACT,24,KJV,and the jews also assented saying that these things were so
8721,ACT,24,KJV,then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself
8722,ACT,24,KJV,because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship
8723,ACT,24,KJV,and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city
8724,ACT,24,KJV,neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me
8725,ACT,24,KJV,but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets
8726,ACT,24,KJV,and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
8727,ACT,24,KJV,and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and
8728,ACT,24,KJV,toward
8729,ACT,24,KJV,men
8730,ACT,24,KJV,now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings
8731,ACT,24,KJV,whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult
8732,ACT,24,KJV,who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me
8733,ACT,24,KJV,or else let these same
8734,ACT,24,KJV,here
8735,ACT,24,KJV,say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council
8736,ACT,24,KJV,except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day
8737,ACT,24,KJV,and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of
8738,ACT,24,KJV,that
8739,ACT,24,KJV,way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter
8740,ACT,24,KJV,and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let
8741,ACT,24,KJV,him
8742,ACT,24,KJV,have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him
8743,ACT,24,KJV,and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ
8744,ACT,24,KJV,and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee
8745,ACT,24,KJV,he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him
8746,ACT,24,KJV,but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound
8747,ACT,25,KJV,now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem
8748,ACT,25,KJV,then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him
8749,ACT,25,KJV,and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him
8750,ACT,25,KJV,but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly
8751,ACT,25,KJV,thither
8752,ACT,25,KJV,
8753,ACT,25,KJV,let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with
8754,ACT,25,KJV,me
8755,ACT,25,KJV,and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him
8756,ACT,25,KJV,and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought
8757,ACT,25,KJV,and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove
8758,ACT,25,KJV,while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all
8759,ACT,25,KJV,but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me
8760,ACT,25,KJV,then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest
8761,ACT,25,KJV,for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appeal unto caesar
8762,ACT,25,KJV,then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go
8763,ACT,25,KJV,and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus
8764,ACT,25,KJV,and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix
8765,ACT,25,KJV,about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed
8766,ACT,25,KJV,me
8767,ACT,25,KJV,desiring
8768,ACT,25,KJV,to have
8769,ACT,25,KJV,judgment against him
8770,ACT,25,KJV,to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him
8771,ACT,25,KJV,therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth
8772,ACT,25,KJV,against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed
8773,ACT,25,KJV,but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive
8774,ACT,25,KJV,and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked
8775,ACT,25,KJV,him
8776,ACT,25,KJV,whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters
8777,ACT,25,KJV,but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
8778,ACT,25,KJV,then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself to morrow said he thou shalt hear him
8779,ACT,25,KJV,and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth
8780,ACT,25,KJV,and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and
8781,ACT,25,KJV,also
8782,ACT,25,KJV,here crying that he ought not to live any longer
8783,ACT,25,KJV,but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him
8784,ACT,25,KJV,of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write
8785,ACT,25,KJV,for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes
8786,ACT,25,KJV,laid
8787,ACT,25,KJV,against him
8788,ACT,26,KJV,then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself
8789,ACT,26,KJV,then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself
8790,ACT,26,KJV,i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews
8791,ACT,26,KJV,especially
8792,ACT,26,KJV,because i know
8793,ACT,26,KJV,thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently
8794,ACT,26,KJV,my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews
8795,ACT,26,KJV,which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee
8796,ACT,26,KJV,and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers
8797,ACT,26,KJV,unto which
8798,ACT,26,KJV,promise
8799,ACT,26,KJV,our twelve tribes instantly serving
8800,ACT,26,KJV,god
8801,ACT,26,KJV,day and night hope to come for which hopes sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews
8802,ACT,26,KJV,why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead
8803,ACT,26,KJV,i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
8804,ACT,26,KJV,which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against
8805,ACT,26,KJV,them
8806,ACT,26,KJV,
8807,ACT,26,KJV,and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled
8808,ACT,26,KJV,them
8809,ACT,26,KJV,to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted
8810,ACT,26,KJV,them
8811,ACT,26,KJV,even unto strange cities
8812,ACT,26,KJV,whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests
8813,ACT,26,KJV,at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me
8814,ACT,26,KJV,and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue
8815,ACT,26,KJV,saul saul why persecutest thou me
8816,ACT,26,KJV,it is
8817,ACT,26,KJV,hard for thee to kick against the pricks
8818,ACT,26,KJV,and i said who art thou lord and he said
8819,ACT,26,KJV,i am jesus whom thou persecutest
8820,ACT,26,KJV,but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee
8821,ACT,26,KJV,delivering thee from the people and
8822,ACT,26,KJV,from
8823,ACT,26,KJV,the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
8824,ACT,26,KJV,to open their eyes
8825,ACT,26,KJV,and
8826,ACT,26,KJV,to turn
8827,ACT,26,KJV,them
8828,ACT,26,KJV,from darkness to light and
8829,ACT,26,KJV,from
8830,ACT,26,KJV,the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me
8831,ACT,26,KJV,whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
8832,ACT,26,KJV,but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and
8833,ACT,26,KJV,then
8834,ACT,26,KJV,to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
8835,ACT,26,KJV,for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill
8836,ACT,26,KJV,me
8837,ACT,26,KJV,
8838,ACT,26,KJV,having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come
8839,ACT,26,KJV,that christ should suffer
8840,ACT,26,KJV,and
8841,ACT,26,KJV,that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles
8842,ACT,26,KJV,and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad
8843,ACT,26,KJV,but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness
8844,ACT,26,KJV,for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner
8845,ACT,26,KJV,king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest
8846,ACT,26,KJV,then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian
8847,ACT,26,KJV,and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds
8848,ACT,26,KJV,and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them
8849,ACT,26,KJV,and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds
8850,ACT,26,KJV,then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar
8851,ACT,27,KJV,and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto
8852,ACT,27,KJV,one
8853,ACT,27,KJV,named julius a centurion of augustus band
8854,ACT,27,KJV,and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia
8855,ACT,27,KJV,one
8856,ACT,27,KJV,aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us
8857,ACT,27,KJV,and the next
8858,ACT,27,KJV,day
8859,ACT,27,KJV,we touched at sidon and julius courteously entreated paul and gave
8860,ACT,27,KJV,him
8861,ACT,27,KJV,liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself
8862,ACT,27,KJV,and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary
8863,ACT,27,KJV,and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra
8864,ACT,27,KJV,a city
8865,ACT,27,KJV,of lycia
8866,ACT,27,KJV,and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein
8867,ACT,27,KJV,and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone
8868,ACT,27,KJV,and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city
8869,ACT,27,KJV,of
8870,ACT,27,KJV,lasea
8871,ACT,27,KJV,now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished
8872,ACT,27,KJV,them
8873,ACT,27,KJV,
8874,ACT,27,KJV,and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives
8875,ACT,27,KJV,nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul
8876,ACT,27,KJV,and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice
8877,ACT,27,KJV,and there
8878,ACT,27,KJV,to winter
8879,ACT,27,KJV,which is
8880,ACT,27,KJV,an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west
8881,ACT,27,KJV,and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained
8882,ACT,27,KJV,their
8883,ACT,27,KJV,purpose loosing
8884,ACT,27,KJV,thence
8885,ACT,27,KJV,they sailed close by crete
8886,ACT,27,KJV,but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon
8887,ACT,27,KJV,and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let
8888,ACT,27,KJV,her
8889,ACT,27,KJV,drive
8890,ACT,27,KJV,and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat
8891,ACT,27,KJV,which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven
8892,ACT,27,KJV,and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next
8893,ACT,27,KJV,day
8894,ACT,27,KJV,they lightened the ship
8895,ACT,27,KJV,and the third
8896,ACT,27,KJV,day
8897,ACT,27,KJV,we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship
8898,ACT,27,KJV,and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on
8899,ACT,27,KJV,us
8900,ACT,27,KJV,all hope that we should be saved was then taken away
8901,ACT,27,KJV,but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss
8902,ACT,27,KJV,and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of
8903,ACT,27,KJV,any mans
8904,ACT,27,KJV,life among you but of the ship
8905,ACT,27,KJV,for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
8906,ACT,27,KJV,saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee
8907,ACT,27,KJV,wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me
8908,ACT,27,KJV,howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island
8909,ACT,27,KJV,but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country
8910,ACT,27,KJV,and sounded and found
8911,ACT,27,KJV,it
8912,ACT,27,KJV,twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found
8913,ACT,27,KJV,it
8914,ACT,27,KJV,fifteen fathoms
8915,ACT,27,KJV,then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day
8916,ACT,27,KJV,and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship
8917,ACT,27,KJV,paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved
8918,ACT,27,KJV,then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off
8919,ACT,27,KJV,and while the day was coming on paul besought
8920,ACT,27,KJV,them
8921,ACT,27,KJV,all to take meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing
8922,ACT,27,KJV,wherefore i pray you to take
8923,ACT,27,KJV,some
8924,ACT,27,KJV,meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you
8925,ACT,27,KJV,and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to god in presence of them all and when he had broken
8926,ACT,27,KJV,it
8927,ACT,27,KJV,he began to eat
8928,ACT,27,KJV,then were they all of good cheer and they also took
8929,ACT,27,KJV,some
8930,ACT,27,KJV,meat
8931,ACT,27,KJV,and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls
8932,ACT,27,KJV,and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea
8933,ACT,27,KJV,and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship
8934,ACT,27,KJV,and when they had taken up the anchors they committed
8935,ACT,27,KJV,themselves
8936,ACT,27,KJV,unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore
8937,ACT,27,KJV,and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves
8938,ACT,27,KJV,and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape
8939,ACT,27,KJV,but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from
8940,ACT,27,KJV,their
8941,ACT,27,KJV,purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast
8942,ACT,27,KJV,themselves
8943,ACT,27,KJV,first
8944,ACT,27,KJV,into the sea
8945,ACT,27,KJV,and get to land
8946,ACT,27,KJV,and the rest some on boards and some on
8947,ACT,27,KJV,broken pieces
8948,ACT,27,KJV,of the ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land
8949,ACT,28,KJV,and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita
8950,ACT,28,KJV,and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold
8951,ACT,28,KJV,and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid
8952,ACT,28,KJV,them
8953,ACT,28,KJV,on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand
8954,ACT,28,KJV,and when the barbarians saw the
8955,ACT,28,KJV,venomous
8956,ACT,28,KJV,beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live
8957,ACT,28,KJV,and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm
8958,ACT,28,KJV,howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god
8959,ACT,28,KJV,in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously
8960,ACT,28,KJV,and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him
8961,ACT,28,KJV,so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed
8962,ACT,28,KJV,who also honoured us with many honours and when we departed they laded
8963,ACT,28,KJV,us
8964,ACT,28,KJV,with such things as were necessary
8965,ACT,28,KJV,and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux
8966,ACT,28,KJV,and landing at syracuse we tarried
8967,ACT,28,KJV,there
8968,ACT,28,KJV,three days
8969,ACT,28,KJV,and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli
8970,ACT,28,KJV,where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome
8971,ACT,28,KJV,and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage
8972,ACT,28,KJV,and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him
8973,ACT,28,KJV,and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men
8974,ACT,28,KJV,and
8975,ACT,28,KJV,brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
8976,ACT,28,KJV,who when they had examined me would have let
8977,ACT,28,KJV,me
8978,ACT,28,KJV,go because there was no cause of death in me
8979,ACT,28,KJV,but when the jews spake against
8980,ACT,28,KJV,it
8981,ACT,28,KJV,i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of
8982,ACT,28,KJV,for this cause therefore have i called for you to see
8983,ACT,28,KJV,you
8984,ACT,28,KJV,and to speak with
8985,ACT,28,KJV,you
8986,ACT,28,KJV,because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain
8987,ACT,28,KJV,and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee
8988,ACT,28,KJV,but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against
8989,ACT,28,KJV,and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into
8990,ACT,28,KJV,his
8991,ACT,28,KJV,lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and
8992,ACT,28,KJV,out of
8993,ACT,28,KJV,the prophets from morning till evening
8994,ACT,28,KJV,and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not
8995,ACT,28,KJV,and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers
8996,ACT,28,KJV,saying
8997,ACT,28,KJV,go unto this people and say
8998,ACT,28,KJV,hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand
8999,ACT,28,KJV,and seeing ye shall see and not perceive
9000,ACT,28,KJV,for the heart of this people is waxed gross
9001,ACT,28,KJV,and their ears are dull of hearing
9002,ACT,28,KJV,and their eyes have they closed
9003,ACT,28,KJV,lest they should see with
9004,ACT,28,KJV,their
9005,ACT,28,KJV,eyes
9006,ACT,28,KJV,and hear with
9007,ACT,28,KJV,their
9008,ACT,28,KJV,ears
9009,ACT,28,KJV,and understand with
9010,ACT,28,KJV,their
9011,ACT,28,KJV,heart
9012,ACT,28,KJV,and should be converted
9013,ACT,28,KJV,and i should heal them
9014,ACT,28,KJV,be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and
9015,ACT,28,KJV,that
9016,ACT,28,KJV,they will hear it
9017,ACT,28,KJV,and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves
9018,ACT,28,KJV,and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him
9019,ACT,28,KJV,preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him
9020,ROM,1,KJV,paul a servant of jesus christ called
9021,ROM,1,KJV,to be
9022,ROM,1,KJV,an apostle separated unto the gospel of god
9023,ROM,1,KJV,which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures
9024,ROM,1,KJV,concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh
9025,ROM,1,KJV,and declared
9026,ROM,1,KJV,to be
9027,ROM,1,KJV,the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead
9028,ROM,1,KJV,by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name
9029,ROM,1,KJV,among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ
9030,ROM,1,KJV,to all that be in rome beloved of god called
9031,ROM,1,KJV,to be
9032,ROM,1,KJV,saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
9033,ROM,1,KJV,first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world
9034,ROM,1,KJV,for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers
9035,ROM,1,KJV,making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you
9036,ROM,1,KJV,for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established
9037,ROM,1,KJV,that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
9038,ROM,1,KJV,now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles
9039,ROM,1,KJV,i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise
9040,ROM,1,KJV,so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also
9041,ROM,1,KJV,for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek
9042,ROM,1,KJV,for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith
9043,ROM,1,KJV,for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness
9044,ROM,1,KJV,because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed
9045,ROM,1,KJV,it
9046,ROM,1,KJV,unto them
9047,ROM,1,KJV,for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made
9048,ROM,1,KJV,even
9049,ROM,1,KJV,his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
9050,ROM,1,KJV,because that when they knew god they glorified
9051,ROM,1,KJV,him
9052,ROM,1,KJV,not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
9053,ROM,1,KJV,professing themselves to be wise they became fools
9054,ROM,1,KJV,and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things
9055,ROM,1,KJV,wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
9056,ROM,1,KJV,who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
9057,ROM,1,KJV,for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature
9058,ROM,1,KJV,and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet
9059,ROM,1,KJV,and even as they did not like to retain god in
9060,ROM,1,KJV,their
9061,ROM,1,KJV,knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient
9062,ROM,1,KJV,being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers
9063,ROM,1,KJV,backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents
9064,ROM,1,KJV,without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful
9065,ROM,1,KJV,who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
9066,ROM,2,KJV,therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things
9067,ROM,2,KJV,but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things
9068,ROM,2,KJV,and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god
9069,ROM,2,KJV,or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance
9070,ROM,2,KJV,but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god
9071,ROM,2,KJV,who will render to every man according to his deeds
9072,ROM,2,KJV,to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life
9073,ROM,2,KJV,but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath
9074,ROM,2,KJV,tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile
9075,ROM,2,KJV,but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile
9076,ROM,2,KJV,for there is no respect of persons with god
9077,ROM,2,KJV,for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
9078,ROM,2,KJV,for not the hearers of the law
9079,ROM,2,KJV,are
9080,ROM,2,KJV,just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified
9081,ROM,2,KJV,for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves
9082,ROM,2,KJV,which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and
9083,ROM,2,KJV,their
9084,ROM,2,KJV,thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another
9085,ROM,2,KJV,in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel
9086,ROM,2,KJV,behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god
9087,ROM,2,KJV,and knowest
9088,ROM,2,KJV,his
9089,ROM,2,KJV,will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law
9090,ROM,2,KJV,and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness
9091,ROM,2,KJV,an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law
9092,ROM,2,KJV,thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal
9093,ROM,2,KJV,thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege
9094,ROM,2,KJV,thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou god
9095,ROM,2,KJV,for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written
9096,ROM,2,KJV,for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
9097,ROM,2,KJV,therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision
9098,ROM,2,KJV,and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law
9099,ROM,2,KJV,for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither
9100,ROM,2,KJV,is that
9101,ROM,2,KJV,circumcision which is outward in the flesh
9102,ROM,2,KJV,but he
9103,ROM,2,KJV,is
9104,ROM,2,KJV,a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision
9105,ROM,2,KJV,is that
9106,ROM,2,KJV,of the heart in the spirit
9107,ROM,2,KJV,and
9108,ROM,2,KJV,not in the letter whose praise
9109,ROM,2,KJV,is
9110,ROM,2,KJV,not of men but of god
9111,ROM,3,KJV,what advantage then hath the jew or what profit
9112,ROM,3,KJV,is there
9113,ROM,3,KJV,of circumcision
9114,ROM,3,KJV,much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god
9115,ROM,3,KJV,for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect
9116,ROM,3,KJV,god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written
9117,ROM,3,KJV,that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings
9118,ROM,3,KJV,and mightest overcome when thou art judged
9119,ROM,3,KJV,but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say
9120,ROM,3,KJV,is
9121,ROM,3,KJV,god unrighteous who taketh vengeance i speak as a man
9122,ROM,3,KJV,god forbid for then how shall god judge the world
9123,ROM,3,KJV,for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory why yet am i also judged as a sinner
9124,ROM,3,KJV,and not
9125,ROM,3,KJV,rather
9126,ROM,3,KJV,as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is just
9127,ROM,3,KJV,what then are we better
9128,ROM,3,KJV,than they
9129,ROM,3,KJV,no in no wise for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin
9130,ROM,3,KJV,as it is written
9131,ROM,3,KJV,there is none righteous no not one
9132,ROM,3,KJV,there is none that understandeth
9133,ROM,3,KJV,there is none that seeketh after god
9134,ROM,3,KJV,they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable
9135,ROM,3,KJV,there is none that doeth good no not one
9136,ROM,3,KJV,their throat
9137,ROM,3,KJV,is
9138,ROM,3,KJV,an open sepulchre
9139,ROM,3,KJV,with their tongues they have used deceit
9140,ROM,3,KJV,the poison of asps
9141,ROM,3,KJV,is
9142,ROM,3,KJV,under their lips
9143,ROM,3,KJV,whose mouth
9144,ROM,3,KJV,is
9145,ROM,3,KJV,full of cursing and bitterness
9146,ROM,3,KJV,their feet
9147,ROM,3,KJV,are
9148,ROM,3,KJV,swift to shed blood
9149,ROM,3,KJV,destruction and misery
9150,ROM,3,KJV,are
9151,ROM,3,KJV,in their ways
9152,ROM,3,KJV,and the way of peace have they not known
9153,ROM,3,KJV,there is no fear of god before their eyes
9154,ROM,3,KJV,now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god
9155,ROM,3,KJV,therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law
9156,ROM,3,KJV,is
9157,ROM,3,KJV,the knowledge of sin
9158,ROM,3,KJV,but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets
9159,ROM,3,KJV,even the righteousness of god
9160,ROM,3,KJV,which is
9161,ROM,3,KJV,by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference
9162,ROM,3,KJV,for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
9163,ROM,3,KJV,being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
9164,ROM,3,KJV,whom god hath set forth
9165,ROM,3,KJV,to be
9166,ROM,3,KJV,a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god
9167,ROM,3,KJV,to declare
9168,ROM,3,KJV,i say
9169,ROM,3,KJV,at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus
9170,ROM,3,KJV,where
9171,ROM,3,KJV,is
9172,ROM,3,KJV,boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith
9173,ROM,3,KJV,therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law
9174,ROM,3,KJV,is he
9175,ROM,3,KJV,the god of the jews only
9176,ROM,3,KJV,is he
9177,ROM,3,KJV,not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also
9178,ROM,3,KJV,seeing
9179,ROM,3,KJV,it is
9180,ROM,3,KJV,one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith
9181,ROM,3,KJV,do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law
9182,ROM,4,KJV,what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found
9183,ROM,4,KJV,for if abraham were justified by works he hath
9184,ROM,4,KJV,whereof
9185,ROM,4,KJV,to glory but not before god
9186,ROM,4,KJV,for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness
9187,ROM,4,KJV,now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
9188,ROM,4,KJV,but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9189,ROM,4,KJV,even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works
9190,ROM,4,KJV,saying
9191,ROM,4,KJV,blessed
9192,ROM,4,KJV,are
9193,ROM,4,KJV,they whose iniquities are forgiven
9194,ROM,4,KJV,and whose sins are covered
9195,ROM,4,KJV,blessed
9196,ROM,4,KJV,is
9197,ROM,4,KJV,the man to whom the lord will not impute sin
9198,ROM,4,KJV,cometh
9199,ROM,4,KJV,this blessedness then upon the circumcision
9200,ROM,4,KJV,only
9201,ROM,4,KJV,or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness
9202,ROM,4,KJV,how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision
9203,ROM,4,KJV,and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which
9204,ROM,4,KJV,he had yet
9205,ROM,4,KJV,being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also
9206,ROM,4,KJV,and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which
9207,ROM,4,KJV,he had
9208,ROM,4,KJV,being
9209,ROM,4,KJV,yet
9210,ROM,4,KJV,uncircumcised
9211,ROM,4,KJV,for the promise that he should be the heir of the world
9212,ROM,4,KJV,was
9213,ROM,4,KJV,not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith
9214,ROM,4,KJV,for if they which are of the law
9215,ROM,4,KJV,be
9216,ROM,4,KJV,heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect
9217,ROM,4,KJV,because the law worketh wrath for where no law is
9218,ROM,4,KJV,there is
9219,ROM,4,KJV,no transgression
9220,ROM,4,KJV,therefore
9221,ROM,4,KJV,it is
9222,ROM,4,KJV,of faith that
9223,ROM,4,KJV,it might be
9224,ROM,4,KJV,by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all
9225,ROM,4,KJV,as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed
9226,ROM,4,KJV,even
9227,ROM,4,KJV,god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were
9228,ROM,4,KJV,who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be
9229,ROM,4,KJV,and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarahs womb
9230,ROM,4,KJV,he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god
9231,ROM,4,KJV,and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform
9232,ROM,4,KJV,and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness
9233,ROM,4,KJV,now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him
9234,ROM,4,KJV,but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead
9235,ROM,4,KJV,who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification
9236,ROM,5,KJV,therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
9237,ROM,5,KJV,by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
9238,ROM,5,KJV,and not only
9239,ROM,5,KJV,so
9240,ROM,5,KJV,but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience
9241,ROM,5,KJV,and patience experience and experience hope
9242,ROM,5,KJV,and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us
9243,ROM,5,KJV,for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly
9244,ROM,5,KJV,for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die
9245,ROM,5,KJV,but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
9246,ROM,5,KJV,much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
9247,ROM,5,KJV,for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life
9248,ROM,5,KJV,and not only
9249,ROM,5,KJV,so
9250,ROM,5,KJV,but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement
9251,ROM,5,KJV,wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
9252,ROM,5,KJV,for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law
9253,ROM,5,KJV,nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression who is the figure of him that was to come
9254,ROM,5,KJV,but not as the offence so also
9255,ROM,5,KJV,is
9256,ROM,5,KJV,the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace
9257,ROM,5,KJV,which is
9258,ROM,5,KJV,by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many
9259,ROM,5,KJV,and not as
9260,ROM,5,KJV,it was
9261,ROM,5,KJV,by one that sinned
9262,ROM,5,KJV,so is
9263,ROM,5,KJV,the gift for the judgment
9264,ROM,5,KJV,was
9265,ROM,5,KJV,by one to condemnation but the free gift
9266,ROM,5,KJV,is
9267,ROM,5,KJV,of many offences unto justification
9268,ROM,5,KJV,for if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ
9269,ROM,5,KJV,therefore as by the offence of one
9270,ROM,5,KJV,judgment came
9271,ROM,5,KJV,upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one
9272,ROM,5,KJV,the free gift came
9273,ROM,5,KJV,upon all men unto justification of life
9274,ROM,5,KJV,for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
9275,ROM,5,KJV,moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound
9276,ROM,5,KJV,that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord
9277,ROM,6,KJV,what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound
9278,ROM,6,KJV,god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein
9279,ROM,6,KJV,know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death
9280,ROM,6,KJV,therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life
9281,ROM,6,KJV,for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also
9282,ROM,6,KJV,in the likeness
9283,ROM,6,KJV,of
9284,ROM,6,KJV,his
9285,ROM,6,KJV,resurrection
9286,ROM,6,KJV,knowing this that our old man is crucified with
9287,ROM,6,KJV,him
9288,ROM,6,KJV,that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin
9289,ROM,6,KJV,for he that is dead is freed from sin
9290,ROM,6,KJV,now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him
9291,ROM,6,KJV,knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him
9292,ROM,6,KJV,for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god
9293,ROM,6,KJV,likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord
9294,ROM,6,KJV,let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
9295,ROM,6,KJV,neither yield ye your members
9296,ROM,6,KJV,as
9297,ROM,6,KJV,instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members
9298,ROM,6,KJV,as
9299,ROM,6,KJV,instruments of righteousness unto god
9300,ROM,6,KJV,for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
9301,ROM,6,KJV,what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid
9302,ROM,6,KJV,know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness
9303,ROM,6,KJV,but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you
9304,ROM,6,KJV,being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness
9305,ROM,6,KJV,i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness
9306,ROM,6,KJV,for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness
9307,ROM,6,KJV,what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things
9308,ROM,6,KJV,is
9309,ROM,6,KJV,death
9310,ROM,6,KJV,but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life
9311,ROM,6,KJV,for the wages of sin
9312,ROM,6,KJV,is
9313,ROM,6,KJV,death but the gift of god
9314,ROM,6,KJV,is
9315,ROM,6,KJV,eternal life through jesus christ our lord
9316,ROM,7,KJV,know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth
9317,ROM,7,KJV,for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to
9318,ROM,7,KJV,her
9319,ROM,7,KJV,husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of
9320,ROM,7,KJV,her
9321,ROM,7,KJV,husband
9322,ROM,7,KJV,so then if while
9323,ROM,7,KJV,her
9324,ROM,7,KJV,husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man
9325,ROM,7,KJV,wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another
9326,ROM,7,KJV,even
9327,ROM,7,KJV,to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god
9328,ROM,7,KJV,for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death
9329,ROM,7,KJV,but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not
9330,ROM,7,KJV,in
9331,ROM,7,KJV,the oldness of the letter
9332,ROM,7,KJV,what shall we say then
9333,ROM,7,KJV,is
9334,ROM,7,KJV,the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet
9335,ROM,7,KJV,but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin
9336,ROM,7,KJV,was
9337,ROM,7,KJV,dead
9338,ROM,7,KJV,for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died
9339,ROM,7,KJV,and the commandment which
9340,ROM,7,KJV,was ordained
9341,ROM,7,KJV,to life i found
9342,ROM,7,KJV,to be
9343,ROM,7,KJV,unto death
9344,ROM,7,KJV,for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew
9345,ROM,7,KJV,me
9346,ROM,7,KJV,
9347,ROM,7,KJV,wherefore the law
9348,ROM,7,KJV,is
9349,ROM,7,KJV,holy and the commandment holy and just and good
9350,ROM,7,KJV,was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful
9351,ROM,7,KJV,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin
9352,ROM,7,KJV,for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i
9353,ROM,7,KJV,if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that
9354,ROM,7,KJV,it is
9355,ROM,7,KJV,good
9356,ROM,7,KJV,now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
9357,ROM,7,KJV,for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but
9358,ROM,7,KJV,how
9359,ROM,7,KJV,to perform that which is good i find not
9360,ROM,7,KJV,for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do
9361,ROM,7,KJV,now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
9362,ROM,7,KJV,i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me
9363,ROM,7,KJV,for i delight in the law of god after the inward man
9364,ROM,7,KJV,but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
9365,ROM,7,KJV,o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
9366,ROM,7,KJV,i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin
9367,ROM,8,KJV,there is
9368,ROM,8,KJV,therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
9369,ROM,8,KJV,for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
9370,ROM,8,KJV,for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
9371,ROM,8,KJV,that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
9372,ROM,8,KJV,for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit
9373,ROM,8,KJV,for to be carnally minded
9374,ROM,8,KJV,is
9375,ROM,8,KJV,death but to be spiritually minded
9376,ROM,8,KJV,is
9377,ROM,8,KJV,life and peace
9378,ROM,8,KJV,because the carnal mind
9379,ROM,8,KJV,is
9380,ROM,8,KJV,enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be
9381,ROM,8,KJV,so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
9382,ROM,8,KJV,but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
9383,ROM,8,KJV,and if christ
9384,ROM,8,KJV,be
9385,ROM,8,KJV,in you the body
9386,ROM,8,KJV,is
9387,ROM,8,KJV,dead because of sin but the spirit
9388,ROM,8,KJV,is
9389,ROM,8,KJV,life because of righteousness
9390,ROM,8,KJV,but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you
9391,ROM,8,KJV,therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh
9392,ROM,8,KJV,for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
9393,ROM,8,KJV,for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
9394,ROM,8,KJV,for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father
9395,ROM,8,KJV,the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god
9396,ROM,8,KJV,and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with
9397,ROM,8,KJV,him
9398,ROM,8,KJV,that we may be also glorified together
9399,ROM,8,KJV,for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time
9400,ROM,8,KJV,are
9401,ROM,8,KJV,not worthy
9402,ROM,8,KJV,to be compared
9403,ROM,8,KJV,with the glory which shall be revealed in us
9404,ROM,8,KJV,for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god
9405,ROM,8,KJV,for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected
9406,ROM,8,KJV,the same
9407,ROM,8,KJV,in hope
9408,ROM,8,KJV,because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god
9409,ROM,8,KJV,for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now
9410,ROM,8,KJV,and not only
9411,ROM,8,KJV,they
9412,ROM,8,KJV,but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption
9413,ROM,8,KJV,to wit
9414,ROM,8,KJV,the redemption of our body
9415,ROM,8,KJV,for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for
9416,ROM,8,KJV,but if we hope for that we see not
9417,ROM,8,KJV,then
9418,ROM,8,KJV,do we with patience wait for
9419,ROM,8,KJV,it
9420,ROM,8,KJV,likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
9421,ROM,8,KJV,and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what
9422,ROM,8,KJV,is
9423,ROM,8,KJV,the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to
9424,ROM,8,KJV,the will of
9425,ROM,8,KJV,god
9426,ROM,8,KJV,and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to
9427,ROM,8,KJV,his
9428,ROM,8,KJV,purpose
9429,ROM,8,KJV,for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate
9430,ROM,8,KJV,to be
9431,ROM,8,KJV,conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren
9432,ROM,8,KJV,moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified
9433,ROM,8,KJV,what shall we then say to these things if god
9434,ROM,8,KJV,be
9435,ROM,8,KJV,for us who
9436,ROM,8,KJV,can be
9437,ROM,8,KJV,against us
9438,ROM,8,KJV,he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
9439,ROM,8,KJV,who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect
9440,ROM,8,KJV,it is
9441,ROM,8,KJV,god that justifieth
9442,ROM,8,KJV,who
9443,ROM,8,KJV,is
9444,ROM,8,KJV,he that condemneth
9445,ROM,8,KJV,it is
9446,ROM,8,KJV,christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us
9447,ROM,8,KJV,who shall separate us from the love of christ
9448,ROM,8,KJV,shall
9449,ROM,8,KJV,tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
9450,ROM,8,KJV,as it is written
9451,ROM,8,KJV,for thy sake we are killed all the day long
9452,ROM,8,KJV,we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
9453,ROM,8,KJV,nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us
9454,ROM,8,KJV,for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
9455,ROM,8,KJV,nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
9456,ROM,9,KJV,i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost
9457,ROM,9,KJV,that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart
9458,ROM,9,KJV,for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh
9459,ROM,9,KJV,who are israelites to whom
9460,ROM,9,KJV,pertaineth
9461,ROM,9,KJV,the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service
9462,ROM,9,KJV,of god
9463,ROM,9,KJV,and the promises
9464,ROM,9,KJV,whose
9465,ROM,9,KJV,are
9466,ROM,9,KJV,the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ
9467,ROM,9,KJV,came
9468,ROM,9,KJV,who is over all god blessed for ever amen
9469,ROM,9,KJV,not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they
9470,ROM,9,KJV,are
9471,ROM,9,KJV,not all israel which are of israel
9472,ROM,9,KJV,neither because they are the seed of abraham
9473,ROM,9,KJV,are they
9474,ROM,9,KJV,all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called
9475,ROM,9,KJV,that is they which are the children of the flesh these
9476,ROM,9,KJV,are
9477,ROM,9,KJV,not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed
9478,ROM,9,KJV,for this
9479,ROM,9,KJV,is
9480,ROM,9,KJV,the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son
9481,ROM,9,KJV,and not only
9482,ROM,9,KJV,this
9483,ROM,9,KJV,but when rebecca also had conceived by one
9484,ROM,9,KJV,even
9485,ROM,9,KJV,by our father isaac
9486,ROM,9,KJV,for
9487,ROM,9,KJV,the children
9488,ROM,9,KJV,being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth
9489,ROM,9,KJV,it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger
9490,ROM,9,KJV,as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
9491,ROM,9,KJV,what shall we say then
9492,ROM,9,KJV,is there
9493,ROM,9,KJV,unrighteousness with god god forbid
9494,ROM,9,KJV,for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
9495,ROM,9,KJV,so then
9496,ROM,9,KJV,it is
9497,ROM,9,KJV,not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy
9498,ROM,9,KJV,for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth
9499,ROM,9,KJV,therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
9500,ROM,9,KJV,have mercy
9501,ROM,9,KJV,and whom he will he hardeneth
9502,ROM,9,KJV,thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will
9503,ROM,9,KJV,nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed
9504,ROM,9,KJV,it
9505,ROM,9,KJV,why hast thou made me thus
9506,ROM,9,KJV,hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour
9507,ROM,9,KJV,what
9508,ROM,9,KJV,if god willing to shew
9509,ROM,9,KJV,his
9510,ROM,9,KJV,wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
9511,ROM,9,KJV,and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory
9512,ROM,9,KJV,even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles
9513,ROM,9,KJV,as he saith also in osee
9514,ROM,9,KJV,i will call them my people which were not my people
9515,ROM,9,KJV,and her beloved which was not beloved
9516,ROM,9,KJV,and it shall come to pass
9517,ROM,9,KJV,that
9518,ROM,9,KJV,in the place where it was said unto them ye
9519,ROM,9,KJV,are
9520,ROM,9,KJV,not my people
9521,ROM,9,KJV,there shall they be called the children of the living god
9522,ROM,9,KJV,esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved
9523,ROM,9,KJV,for he will finish the work and cut
9524,ROM,9,KJV,it
9525,ROM,9,KJV,short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth
9526,ROM,9,KJV,and as esaias said before
9527,ROM,9,KJV,except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed
9528,ROM,9,KJV,we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha
9529,ROM,9,KJV,what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith
9530,ROM,9,KJV,but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness
9531,ROM,9,KJV,wherefore because
9532,ROM,9,KJV,they sought it
9533,ROM,9,KJV,not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone
9534,ROM,9,KJV,as it is written
9535,ROM,9,KJV,behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence
9536,ROM,9,KJV,and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
9537,ROM,10,KJV,brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved
9538,ROM,10,KJV,for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge
9539,ROM,10,KJV,for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god
9540,ROM,10,KJV,for christ
9541,ROM,10,KJV,is
9542,ROM,10,KJV,the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
9543,ROM,10,KJV,for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them
9544,ROM,10,KJV,but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down
9545,ROM,10,KJV,from above
9546,ROM,10,KJV,
9547,ROM,10,KJV,or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead
9548,ROM,10,KJV,but what saith it the word is nigh thee
9549,ROM,10,KJV,even
9550,ROM,10,KJV,in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach
9551,ROM,10,KJV,that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved
9552,ROM,10,KJV,for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
9553,ROM,10,KJV,for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
9554,ROM,10,KJV,for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
9555,ROM,10,KJV,for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9556,ROM,10,KJV,how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher
9557,ROM,10,KJV,and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things
9558,ROM,10,KJV,but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report
9559,ROM,10,KJV,so then faith
9560,ROM,10,KJV,cometh
9561,ROM,10,KJV,by hearing and hearing by the word of god
9562,ROM,10,KJV,but i say have they not heard yes verily
9563,ROM,10,KJV,their sound went into all the earth
9564,ROM,10,KJV,and their words unto the ends of the world
9565,ROM,10,KJV,but i say did not israel know first moses saith
9566,ROM,10,KJV,i will provoke you to jealousy by
9567,ROM,10,KJV,them that are
9568,ROM,10,KJV,no people
9569,ROM,10,KJV,and
9570,ROM,10,KJV,by a foolish nation i will anger you
9571,ROM,10,KJV,but esaias is very bold and saith
9572,ROM,10,KJV,i was found of them that sought me not
9573,ROM,10,KJV,i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me
9574,ROM,10,KJV,but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people
9575,ROM,11,KJV,i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham
9576,ROM,11,KJV,of
9577,ROM,11,KJV,the tribe of benjamin
9578,ROM,11,KJV,god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying
9579,ROM,11,KJV,lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life
9580,ROM,11,KJV,but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to
9581,ROM,11,KJV,the image of
9582,ROM,11,KJV,baal
9583,ROM,11,KJV,even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
9584,ROM,11,KJV,and if by grace then
9585,ROM,11,KJV,is it
9586,ROM,11,KJV,no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if
9587,ROM,11,KJV,it be
9588,ROM,11,KJV,of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work
9589,ROM,11,KJV,what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded
9590,ROM,11,KJV,according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day
9591,ROM,11,KJV,and david saith
9592,ROM,11,KJV,let their table be made a snare and a trap
9593,ROM,11,KJV,and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them
9594,ROM,11,KJV,let their eyes be darkened that they may not see
9595,ROM,11,KJV,and bow down their back alway
9596,ROM,11,KJV,i say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but
9597,ROM,11,KJV,rather
9598,ROM,11,KJV,through their fall salvation
9599,ROM,11,KJV,is come
9600,ROM,11,KJV,unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy
9601,ROM,11,KJV,now if the fall of them
9602,ROM,11,KJV,be
9603,ROM,11,KJV,the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness
9604,ROM,11,KJV,for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office
9605,ROM,11,KJV,if by any means i may provoke to emulation
9606,ROM,11,KJV,them which are
9607,ROM,11,KJV,my flesh and might save some of them
9608,ROM,11,KJV,for if the casting away of them
9609,ROM,11,KJV,be
9610,ROM,11,KJV,the reconciling of the world what
9611,ROM,11,KJV,shall
9612,ROM,11,KJV,the receiving
9613,ROM,11,KJV,of them be
9614,ROM,11,KJV,but life from the dead
9615,ROM,11,KJV,for if the firstfruit
9616,ROM,11,KJV,be
9617,ROM,11,KJV,holy the lump
9618,ROM,11,KJV,is
9619,ROM,11,KJV,also
9620,ROM,11,KJV,holy
9621,ROM,11,KJV,and if the root
9622,ROM,11,KJV,be
9623,ROM,11,KJV,holy so
9624,ROM,11,KJV,are
9625,ROM,11,KJV,the branches
9626,ROM,11,KJV,and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree
9627,ROM,11,KJV,boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee
9628,ROM,11,KJV,thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in
9629,ROM,11,KJV,well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear
9630,ROM,11,KJV,for if god spared not the natural branches
9631,ROM,11,KJV,take heed
9632,ROM,11,KJV,lest he also spare not thee
9633,ROM,11,KJV,behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in
9634,ROM,11,KJV,his
9635,ROM,11,KJV,goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off
9636,ROM,11,KJV,and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again
9637,ROM,11,KJV,for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural
9638,ROM,11,KJV,branches
9639,ROM,11,KJV,be graffed into their own olive tree
9640,ROM,11,KJV,for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in
9641,ROM,11,KJV,and so all israel shall be saved as it is written
9642,ROM,11,KJV,there shall come out of sion the deliverer
9643,ROM,11,KJV,and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob
9644,ROM,11,KJV,for this
9645,ROM,11,KJV,is
9646,ROM,11,KJV,my covenant unto them
9647,ROM,11,KJV,when i shall take away their sins
9648,ROM,11,KJV,as concerning the gospel
9649,ROM,11,KJV,they are
9650,ROM,11,KJV,enemies for your sakes but as touching the election
9651,ROM,11,KJV,they are
9652,ROM,11,KJV,beloved for the fathers sakes
9653,ROM,11,KJV,for the gifts and calling of god
9654,ROM,11,KJV,are
9655,ROM,11,KJV,without repentance
9656,ROM,11,KJV,for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief
9657,ROM,11,KJV,even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
9658,ROM,11,KJV,for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all
9659,ROM,11,KJV,o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable
9660,ROM,11,KJV,are
9661,ROM,11,KJV,his judgments and his ways past finding out
9662,ROM,11,KJV,for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor
9663,ROM,11,KJV,or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again
9664,ROM,11,KJV,for of him and through him and to him
9665,ROM,11,KJV,are
9666,ROM,11,KJV,all things to whom
9667,ROM,11,KJV,be
9668,ROM,11,KJV,glory for ever amen
9669,ROM,12,KJV,i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god
9670,ROM,12,KJV,which is
9671,ROM,12,KJV,your reasonable service
9672,ROM,12,KJV,and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what
9673,ROM,12,KJV,is
9674,ROM,12,KJV,that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
9675,ROM,12,KJV,for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think
9676,ROM,12,KJV,of himself
9677,ROM,12,KJV,more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith
9678,ROM,12,KJV,for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office
9679,ROM,12,KJV,so we
9680,ROM,12,KJV,being
9681,ROM,12,KJV,many are one body in christ and every one members one of another
9682,ROM,12,KJV,having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy
9683,ROM,12,KJV,let us prophesy
9684,ROM,12,KJV,according to the proportion of faith
9685,ROM,12,KJV,or ministry
9686,ROM,12,KJV,let us wait
9687,ROM,12,KJV,on
9688,ROM,12,KJV,our
9689,ROM,12,KJV,ministering or he that teacheth on teaching
9690,ROM,12,KJV,or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth
9691,ROM,12,KJV,let him do it
9692,ROM,12,KJV,with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness
9693,ROM,12,KJV,let
9694,ROM,12,KJV,love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good
9695,ROM,12,KJV,be
9696,ROM,12,KJV,kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another
9697,ROM,12,KJV,not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord
9698,ROM,12,KJV,rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer
9699,ROM,12,KJV,distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality
9700,ROM,12,KJV,bless them which persecute you bless and curse not
9701,ROM,12,KJV,rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep
9702,ROM,12,KJV,be
9703,ROM,12,KJV,of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits
9704,ROM,12,KJV,recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men
9705,ROM,12,KJV,if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men
9706,ROM,12,KJV,dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but
9707,ROM,12,KJV,rather
9708,ROM,12,KJV,give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance
9709,ROM,12,KJV,is
9710,ROM,12,KJV,mine i will repay saith the lord
9711,ROM,12,KJV,therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
9712,ROM,12,KJV,be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good
9713,ROM,13,KJV,let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god
9714,ROM,13,KJV,whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
9715,ROM,13,KJV,for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same
9716,ROM,13,KJV,for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to
9717,ROM,13,KJV,execute
9718,ROM,13,KJV,wrath upon him that doeth evil
9719,ROM,13,KJV,wherefore
9720,ROM,13,KJV,ye
9721,ROM,13,KJV,must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake
9722,ROM,13,KJV,for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing
9723,ROM,13,KJV,render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute
9724,ROM,13,KJV,is due
9725,ROM,13,KJV,custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour
9726,ROM,13,KJV,owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
9727,ROM,13,KJV,for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if
9728,ROM,13,KJV,there be
9729,ROM,13,KJV,any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
9730,ROM,13,KJV,love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love
9731,ROM,13,KJV,is
9732,ROM,13,KJV,the fulfilling of the law
9733,ROM,13,KJV,and that knowing the time that now
9734,ROM,13,KJV,it is
9735,ROM,13,KJV,high time to awake out of sleep for now
9736,ROM,13,KJV,is
9737,ROM,13,KJV,our salvation nearer than when we believed
9738,ROM,13,KJV,the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light
9739,ROM,13,KJV,let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying
9740,ROM,13,KJV,but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to
9741,ROM,13,KJV,fulfil
9742,ROM,13,KJV,the lusts
9743,ROM,13,KJV,thereof
9744,ROM,14,KJV,him that is weak in the faith receive ye
9745,ROM,14,KJV,but
9746,ROM,14,KJV,not to doubtful disputations
9747,ROM,14,KJV,for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs
9748,ROM,14,KJV,let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him
9749,ROM,14,KJV,who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand
9750,ROM,14,KJV,one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day
9751,ROM,14,KJV,alike
9752,ROM,14,KJV,let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind
9753,ROM,14,KJV,he that regardeth the day regardeth
9754,ROM,14,KJV,it
9755,ROM,14,KJV,unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard
9756,ROM,14,KJV,it
9757,ROM,14,KJV,he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks
9758,ROM,14,KJV,for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself
9759,ROM,14,KJV,for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords
9760,ROM,14,KJV,for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living
9761,ROM,14,KJV,but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ
9762,ROM,14,KJV,for it is written
9763,ROM,14,KJV,as
9764,ROM,14,KJV,i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me
9765,ROM,14,KJV,and every tongue shall confess to god
9766,ROM,14,KJV,so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god
9767,ROM,14,KJV,let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in
9768,ROM,14,KJV,his
9769,ROM,14,KJV,brothers way
9770,ROM,14,KJV,i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that
9771,ROM,14,KJV,there is
9772,ROM,14,KJV,nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him
9773,ROM,14,KJV,it is
9774,ROM,14,KJV,unclean
9775,ROM,14,KJV,but if thy brother be grieved with
9776,ROM,14,KJV,thy
9777,ROM,14,KJV,meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died
9778,ROM,14,KJV,let not then your good be evil spoken of
9779,ROM,14,KJV,for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
9780,ROM,14,KJV,for he that in these things serveth christ
9781,ROM,14,KJV,is
9782,ROM,14,KJV,acceptable to god and approved of men
9783,ROM,14,KJV,let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another
9784,ROM,14,KJV,for meat destroy not the work of god all things indeed
9785,ROM,14,KJV,are
9786,ROM,14,KJV,pure but
9787,ROM,14,KJV,it is
9788,ROM,14,KJV,evil for that man who eateth with offence
9789,ROM,14,KJV,it is
9790,ROM,14,KJV,good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor
9791,ROM,14,KJV,any thing
9792,ROM,14,KJV,whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak
9793,ROM,14,KJV,hast thou faith have
9794,ROM,14,KJV,it
9795,ROM,14,KJV,to thyself before god happy
9796,ROM,14,KJV,is
9797,ROM,14,KJV,he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth
9798,ROM,14,KJV,and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because
9799,ROM,14,KJV,he eateth
9800,ROM,14,KJV,not of faith for whatsoever
9801,ROM,14,KJV,is
9802,ROM,14,KJV,not of faith is sin
9803,ROM,15,KJV,we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves
9804,ROM,15,KJV,let every one of us please
9805,ROM,15,KJV,his
9806,ROM,15,KJV,neighbour for
9807,ROM,15,KJV,his
9808,ROM,15,KJV,good to edification
9809,ROM,15,KJV,for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me
9810,ROM,15,KJV,for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
9811,ROM,15,KJV,now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus
9812,ROM,15,KJV,that ye may with one mind
9813,ROM,15,KJV,and
9814,ROM,15,KJV,one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ
9815,ROM,15,KJV,wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god
9816,ROM,15,KJV,now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises
9817,ROM,15,KJV,made
9818,ROM,15,KJV,unto the fathers
9819,ROM,15,KJV,and that the gentiles might glorify god for
9820,ROM,15,KJV,his
9821,ROM,15,KJV,mercy as it is written
9822,ROM,15,KJV,for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles
9823,ROM,15,KJV,and sing unto thy name
9824,ROM,15,KJV,and again he saith
9825,ROM,15,KJV,rejoice ye gentiles with his people
9826,ROM,15,KJV,and again
9827,ROM,15,KJV,praise the lord all ye gentiles
9828,ROM,15,KJV,and laud him all ye people
9829,ROM,15,KJV,and again esaias saith
9830,ROM,15,KJV,there shall be a root of jesse
9831,ROM,15,KJV,and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles
9832,ROM,15,KJV,in him shall the gentiles trust
9833,ROM,15,KJV,now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost
9834,ROM,15,KJV,and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another
9835,ROM,15,KJV,nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god
9836,ROM,15,KJV,that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost
9837,ROM,15,KJV,i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god
9838,ROM,15,KJV,for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed
9839,ROM,15,KJV,through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ
9840,ROM,15,KJV,yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another mans foundation
9841,ROM,15,KJV,but as it is written
9842,ROM,15,KJV,to whom he was not spoken of they shall see
9843,ROM,15,KJV,and they that have not heard shall understand
9844,ROM,15,KJV,for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you
9845,ROM,15,KJV,but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you
9846,ROM,15,KJV,whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your
9847,ROM,15,KJV,company
9848,ROM,15,KJV,
9849,ROM,15,KJV,but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints
9850,ROM,15,KJV,for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem
9851,ROM,15,KJV,it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things
9852,ROM,15,KJV,when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain
9853,ROM,15,KJV,and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ
9854,ROM,15,KJV,now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in
9855,ROM,15,KJV,your
9856,ROM,15,KJV,prayers to god for me
9857,ROM,15,KJV,that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea and that my service which
9858,ROM,15,KJV,i have
9859,ROM,15,KJV,for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints
9860,ROM,15,KJV,that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed
9861,ROM,15,KJV,now the god of peace
9862,ROM,15,KJV,be
9863,ROM,15,KJV,with you all amen
9864,ROM,16,KJV,i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea
9865,ROM,16,KJV,that ye receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself also
9866,ROM,16,KJV,greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus
9867,ROM,16,KJV,who have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles
9868,ROM,16,KJV,likewise
9869,ROM,16,KJV,greet
9870,ROM,16,KJV,the church that is in their house salute my wellbeloved epaenetus who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ

9884,ROM,16,KJV,salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints which are with them
9885,ROM,16,KJV,salute one another with an holy kiss the churches of christ salute you
9886,ROM,16,KJV,now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them
9887,ROM,16,KJV,for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
9888,ROM,16,KJV,for your obedience is come abroad unto all
9889,ROM,16,KJV,men
9890,ROM,16,KJV,i am glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil
9891,ROM,16,KJV,and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly

9902,ROM,16,KJV,with you all amen
9903,ROM,16,KJV,now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began
9904,ROM,16,KJV,but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith
9905,ROM,16,KJV,to god only wise
9906,ROM,16,KJV,be
9907,ROM,16,KJV,glory through jesus christ for ever amen
9908,ROM,16,KJV,written to the romans from corinthus and sent by phebe servant of the church at cenchrea
9909,1CO,1,KJV,paul called
9910,1CO,1,KJV,to be
9911,1CO,1,KJV,an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes
9912,1CO,1,KJV,our
9913,1CO,1,KJV,brother
9914,1CO,1,KJV,unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called
9915,1CO,1,KJV,to be
9916,1CO,1,KJV,saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours
9917,1CO,1,KJV,grace
9918,1CO,1,KJV,be
9919,1CO,1,KJV,unto you and peace from god our father and
9920,1CO,1,KJV,from
9921,1CO,1,KJV,the lord jesus christ
9922,1CO,1,KJV,i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ
9923,1CO,1,KJV,that in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and
9924,1CO,1,KJV,in
9925,1CO,1,KJV,all knowledge
9926,1CO,1,KJV,even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you
9927,1CO,1,KJV,so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ
9928,1CO,1,KJV,who shall also confirm you unto the end
9929,1CO,1,KJV,that ye may be
9930,1CO,1,KJV,blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ
9931,1CO,1,KJV,god
9932,1CO,1,KJV,is
9933,1CO,1,KJV,faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord
9934,1CO,1,KJV,now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and
9935,1CO,1,KJV,that
9936,1CO,1,KJV,there be no divisions among you but
9937,1CO,1,KJV,that
9938,1CO,1,KJV,ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment
9939,1CO,1,KJV,for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them
9940,1CO,1,KJV,which are of the house
9941,1CO,1,KJV,of chloe that there are contentions among you
9942,1CO,1,KJV,now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ
9943,1CO,1,KJV,is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul
9944,1CO,1,KJV,i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius
9945,1CO,1,KJV,lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name
9946,1CO,1,KJV,and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other
9947,1CO,1,KJV,for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
9948,1CO,1,KJV,for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
9949,1CO,1,KJV,for it is written
9950,1CO,1,KJV,i will destroy the wisdom of the wise
9951,1CO,1,KJV,and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent
9952,1CO,1,KJV,where
9953,1CO,1,KJV,is
9954,1CO,1,KJV,the wise where
9955,1CO,1,KJV,is
9956,1CO,1,KJV,the scribe where
9957,1CO,1,KJV,is
9958,1CO,1,KJV,the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
9959,1CO,1,KJV,for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe
9960,1CO,1,KJV,for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom
9961,1CO,1,KJV,but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness
9962,1CO,1,KJV,but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
9963,1CO,1,KJV,because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
9964,1CO,1,KJV,for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble
9965,1CO,1,KJV,are called
9966,1CO,1,KJV,
9967,1CO,1,KJV,but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty
9968,1CO,1,KJV,and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen
9969,1CO,1,KJV,yea
9970,1CO,1,KJV,and things which are not to bring to nought things that are
9971,1CO,1,KJV,that no flesh should glory in his presence
9972,1CO,1,KJV,but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption
9973,1CO,1,KJV,that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord
9974,1CO,2,KJV,and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god
9975,1CO,2,KJV,for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified
9976,1CO,2,KJV,and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling
9977,1CO,2,KJV,and my speech and my preaching
9978,1CO,2,KJV,was
9979,1CO,2,KJV,not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
9980,1CO,2,KJV,that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god
9981,1CO,2,KJV,howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought
9982,1CO,2,KJV,but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery
9983,1CO,2,KJV,even
9984,1CO,2,KJV,the hidden
9985,1CO,2,KJV,wisdom
9986,1CO,2,KJV,which god ordained before the world unto our glory
9987,1CO,2,KJV,which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known
9988,1CO,2,KJV,it
9989,1CO,2,KJV,they would not have crucified the lord of glory
9990,1CO,2,KJV,but as it is written
9991,1CO,2,KJV,eye hath not seen nor ear heard
9992,1CO,2,KJV,neither have entered into the heart of man
9993,1CO,2,KJV,the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
9994,1CO,2,KJV,but god hath revealed
9995,1CO,2,KJV,them
9996,1CO,2,KJV,unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god
9997,1CO,2,KJV,for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god
9998,1CO,2,KJV,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god
9999,1CO,2,KJV,which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual
10000,1CO,2,KJV,but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know
10001,1CO,2,KJV,them
10002,1CO,2,KJV,because they are spiritually discerned
10003,1CO,2,KJV,but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man
10004,1CO,2,KJV,for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ
10005,1CO,3,KJV,and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal
10006,1CO,3,KJV,even
10007,1CO,3,KJV,as unto babes in christ
10008,1CO,3,KJV,i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able
10009,1CO,3,KJV,to bear it
10010,1CO,3,KJV,neither yet now are ye able
10011,1CO,3,KJV,for ye are yet carnal for whereas
10012,1CO,3,KJV,there is
10013,1CO,3,KJV,among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men
10014,1CO,3,KJV,for while one saith i am of paul and another i
10015,1CO,3,KJV,am
10016,1CO,3,KJV,of apollos are ye not carnal
10017,1CO,3,KJV,who then is paul and who
10018,1CO,3,KJV,is
10019,1CO,3,KJV,apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man
10020,1CO,3,KJV,i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase
10021,1CO,3,KJV,so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase
10022,1CO,3,KJV,now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour
10023,1CO,3,KJV,for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry
10024,1CO,3,KJV,ye are
10025,1CO,3,KJV,gods building
10026,1CO,3,KJV,according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon
10027,1CO,3,KJV,for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ
10028,1CO,3,KJV,now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble
10029,1CO,3,KJV,every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is
10030,1CO,3,KJV,if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward
10031,1CO,3,KJV,if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
10032,1CO,3,KJV,know ye not that ye are the temple of god and
10033,1CO,3,KJV,that
10034,1CO,3,KJV,the spirit of god dwelleth in you
10035,1CO,3,KJV,if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which
10036,1CO,3,KJV,temple
10037,1CO,3,KJV,ye are
10038,1CO,3,KJV,let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise
10039,1CO,3,KJV,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness
10040,1CO,3,KJV,and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain
10041,1CO,3,KJV,therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours
10042,1CO,3,KJV,whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours
10043,1CO,3,KJV,and ye are christs and christ
10044,1CO,3,KJV,is
10045,1CO,3,KJV,gods
10046,1CO,4,KJV,let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god
10047,1CO,4,KJV,moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful
10048,1CO,4,KJV,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self
10049,1CO,4,KJV,for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord
10050,1CO,4,KJV,therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god
10051,1CO,4,KJV,and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and
10052,1CO,4,KJV,to
10053,1CO,4,KJV,apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think
10054,1CO,4,KJV,of men
10055,1CO,4,KJV,above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another
10056,1CO,4,KJV,for who maketh thee to differ
10057,1CO,4,KJV,from another
10058,1CO,4,KJV,and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive
10059,1CO,4,KJV,it
10060,1CO,4,KJV,why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received
10061,1CO,4,KJV,it
10062,1CO,4,KJV,
10063,1CO,4,KJV,now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you
10064,1CO,4,KJV,for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men
10065,1CO,4,KJV,we
10066,1CO,4,KJV,are
10067,1CO,4,KJV,fools for christs sake but ye
10068,1CO,4,KJV,are
10069,1CO,4,KJV,wise in christ we
10070,1CO,4,KJV,are
10071,1CO,4,KJV,weak but ye
10072,1CO,4,KJV,are
10073,1CO,4,KJV,strong ye
10074,1CO,4,KJV,are
10075,1CO,4,KJV,honourable but we
10076,1CO,4,KJV,are
10077,1CO,4,KJV,despised
10078,1CO,4,KJV,even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace
10079,1CO,4,KJV,and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it
10080,1CO,4,KJV,being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world
10081,1CO,4,KJV,and are
10082,1CO,4,KJV,the offscouring of all things unto this day
10083,1CO,4,KJV,i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn
10084,1CO,4,KJV,you
10085,1CO,4,KJV,
10086,1CO,4,KJV,for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet
10087,1CO,4,KJV,have ye
10088,1CO,4,KJV,not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel
10089,1CO,4,KJV,wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me
10090,1CO,4,KJV,for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church
10091,1CO,4,KJV,now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you
10092,1CO,4,KJV,but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power
10093,1CO,4,KJV,for the kingdom of god
10094,1CO,4,KJV,is
10095,1CO,4,KJV,not in word but in power
10096,1CO,4,KJV,what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and
10097,1CO,4,KJV,in
10098,1CO,4,KJV,the spirit of meekness
10099,1CO,5,KJV,it is reported commonly
10100,1CO,5,KJV,that there is
10101,1CO,5,KJV,fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife
10102,1CO,5,KJV,and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you
10103,1CO,5,KJV,for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present
10104,1CO,5,KJV,concerning
10105,1CO,5,KJV,him that hath so done this deed
10106,1CO,5,KJV,in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ
10107,1CO,5,KJV,to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
10108,1CO,5,KJV,your glorying
10109,1CO,5,KJV,is
10110,1CO,5,KJV,not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
10111,1CO,5,KJV,purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us
10112,1CO,5,KJV,therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened
10113,1CO,5,KJV,bread
10114,1CO,5,KJV,of sincerity and truth
10115,1CO,5,KJV,i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
10116,1CO,5,KJV,yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world
10117,1CO,5,KJV,but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat
10118,1CO,5,KJV,for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within
10119,1CO,5,KJV,but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person
10120,1CO,6,KJV,dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints
10121,1CO,6,KJV,do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters
10122,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life
10123,1CO,6,KJV,if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church
10124,1CO,6,KJV,i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren
10125,1CO,6,KJV,but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers
10126,1CO,6,KJV,now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather
10127,1CO,6,KJV,suffer yourselves to
10128,1CO,6,KJV,be defrauded
10129,1CO,6,KJV,nay ye do wrong and defraud and that
10130,1CO,6,KJV,your
10131,1CO,6,KJV,brethren
10132,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind
10133,1CO,6,KJV,nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god
10134,1CO,6,KJV,and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
10135,1CO,6,KJV,all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any
10136,1CO,6,KJV,meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body
10137,1CO,6,KJV,is
10138,1CO,6,KJV,not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body
10139,1CO,6,KJV,and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power
10140,1CO,6,KJV,know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make
10141,1CO,6,KJV,them
10142,1CO,6,KJV,the members of an harlot god forbid
10143,1CO,6,KJV,what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh
10144,1CO,6,KJV,but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit
10145,1CO,6,KJV,flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body
10146,1CO,6,KJV,what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost
10147,1CO,6,KJV,which is
10148,1CO,6,KJV,in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own
10149,1CO,6,KJV,for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
10150,1CO,7,KJV,now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me
10151,1CO,7,KJV,it is
10152,1CO,7,KJV,good for a man not to touch a woman
10153,1CO,7,KJV,nevertheless
10154,1CO,7,KJV,to avoid
10155,1CO,7,KJV,fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband
10156,1CO,7,KJV,let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband
10157,1CO,7,KJV,the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife
10158,1CO,7,KJV,defraud ye not one the other except
10159,1CO,7,KJV,it be
10160,1CO,7,KJV,with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency
10161,1CO,7,KJV,but i speak this by permission
10162,1CO,7,KJV,and
10163,1CO,7,KJV,not of commandment
10164,1CO,7,KJV,for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that
10165,1CO,7,KJV,i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i
10166,1CO,7,KJV,but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn
10167,1CO,7,KJV,and unto the married i command
10168,1CO,7,KJV,yet
10169,1CO,7,KJV,not i but the lord let not the wife depart from
10170,1CO,7,KJV,her
10171,1CO,7,KJV,husband
10172,1CO,7,KJV,but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to
10173,1CO,7,KJV,her
10174,1CO,7,KJV,husband and let not the husband put away
10175,1CO,7,KJV,his
10176,1CO,7,KJV,wife
10177,1CO,7,KJV,but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away
10178,1CO,7,KJV,and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him
10179,1CO,7,KJV,for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy
10180,1CO,7,KJV,but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such
10181,1CO,7,KJV,cases
10182,1CO,7,KJV,but god hath called us to peace
10183,1CO,7,KJV,for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save
10184,1CO,7,KJV,thy
10185,1CO,7,KJV,husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save
10186,1CO,7,KJV,thy
10187,1CO,7,KJV,wife
10188,1CO,7,KJV,but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches
10189,1CO,7,KJV,is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised
10190,1CO,7,KJV,circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god
10191,1CO,7,KJV,let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called
10192,1CO,7,KJV,art thou called
10193,1CO,7,KJV,being
10194,1CO,7,KJV,a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use
10195,1CO,7,KJV,it
10196,1CO,7,KJV,rather
10197,1CO,7,KJV,for he that is called in the lord
10198,1CO,7,KJV,being
10199,1CO,7,KJV,a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called
10200,1CO,7,KJV,being
10201,1CO,7,KJV,free is christs servant
10202,1CO,7,KJV,ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men
10203,1CO,7,KJV,brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god
10204,1CO,7,KJV,now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful
10205,1CO,7,KJV,i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress
10206,1CO,7,KJV,i say
10207,1CO,7,KJV,that
10208,1CO,7,KJV,it is
10209,1CO,7,KJV,good for a man so to be
10210,1CO,7,KJV,art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife
10211,1CO,7,KJV,but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you
10212,1CO,7,KJV,but this i say brethren the time
10213,1CO,7,KJV,is
10214,1CO,7,KJV,short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none
10215,1CO,7,KJV,and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not
10216,1CO,7,KJV,and they that use this world as not abusing
10217,1CO,7,KJV,it
10218,1CO,7,KJV,for the fashion of this world passeth away
10219,1CO,7,KJV,but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord
10220,1CO,7,KJV,but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please
10221,1CO,7,KJV,his
10222,1CO,7,KJV,wife
10223,1CO,7,KJV,there is difference
10224,1CO,7,KJV,also
10225,1CO,7,KJV,between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please
10226,1CO,7,KJV,her
10227,1CO,7,KJV,husband
10228,1CO,7,KJV,and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction
10229,1CO,7,KJV,but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of
10230,1CO,7,KJV,her age
10231,1CO,7,KJV,and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry
10232,1CO,7,KJV,nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well
10233,1CO,7,KJV,so then he that giveth
10234,1CO,7,KJV,her
10235,1CO,7,KJV,in marriage doeth well but he that giveth
10236,1CO,7,KJV,her
10237,1CO,7,KJV,not in marriage doeth better
10238,1CO,7,KJV,the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord
10239,1CO,7,KJV,but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god
10240,1CO,8,KJV,now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth
10241,1CO,8,KJV,and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know
10242,1CO,8,KJV,but if any man love god the same is known of him
10243,1CO,8,KJV,as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol
10244,1CO,8,KJV,is
10245,1CO,8,KJV,nothing in the world and that
10246,1CO,8,KJV,there is
10247,1CO,8,KJV,none other god but one
10248,1CO,8,KJV,for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many
10249,1CO,8,KJV,but to us
10250,1CO,8,KJV,there is but
10251,1CO,8,KJV,one god the father of whom
10252,1CO,8,KJV,are
10253,1CO,8,KJV,all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom
10254,1CO,8,KJV,are
10255,1CO,8,KJV,all things and we by him
10256,1CO,8,KJV,howbeit
10257,1CO,8,KJV,there is
10258,1CO,8,KJV,not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat
10259,1CO,8,KJV,it
10260,1CO,8,KJV,as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
10261,1CO,8,KJV,but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse
10262,1CO,8,KJV,but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak
10263,1CO,8,KJV,for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols
10264,1CO,8,KJV,and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died
10265,1CO,8,KJV,but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ
10266,1CO,8,KJV,wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend
10267,1CO,9,KJV,am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christ our lord are not ye my work in the lord
10268,1CO,9,KJV,if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord
10269,1CO,9,KJV,mine answer to them that do examine me is this
10270,1CO,9,KJV,have we not power to eat and to drink
10271,1CO,9,KJV,have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and
10272,1CO,9,KJV,as
10273,1CO,9,KJV,the brethren of the lord and cephas
10274,1CO,9,KJV,or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working
10275,1CO,9,KJV,who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock
10276,1CO,9,KJV,say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also
10277,1CO,9,KJV,for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen
10278,1CO,9,KJV,or saith he
10279,1CO,9,KJV,it
10280,1CO,9,KJV,altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt
10281,1CO,9,KJV,this
10282,1CO,9,KJV,is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope
10283,1CO,9,KJV,if we have sown unto you spiritual things
10284,1CO,9,KJV,is it
10285,1CO,9,KJV,a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things
10286,1CO,9,KJV,if others be partakers of
10287,1CO,9,KJV,this
10288,1CO,9,KJV,power over you
10289,1CO,9,KJV,are
10290,1CO,9,KJV,not we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ
10291,1CO,9,KJV,do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live
10292,1CO,9,KJV,of the things
10293,1CO,9,KJV,of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar
10294,1CO,9,KJV,even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel
10295,1CO,9,KJV,but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for
10296,1CO,9,KJV,it were
10297,1CO,9,KJV,better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void
10298,1CO,9,KJV,for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel
10299,1CO,9,KJV,for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation
10300,1CO,9,KJV,of the gospel
10301,1CO,9,KJV,is committed unto me
10302,1CO,9,KJV,what is my reward then
10303,1CO,9,KJV,verily
10304,1CO,9,KJV,that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel
10305,1CO,9,KJV,for though i be free from all
10306,1CO,9,KJV,men
10307,1CO,9,KJV,yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more
10308,1CO,9,KJV,and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law
10309,1CO,9,KJV,to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law
10310,1CO,9,KJV,to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all
10311,1CO,9,KJV,men
10312,1CO,9,KJV,that i might by all means save some
10313,1CO,9,KJV,and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with
10314,1CO,9,KJV,you
10315,1CO,9,KJV,know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain
10316,1CO,9,KJV,and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they
10317,1CO,9,KJV,do it
10318,1CO,9,KJV,to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible
10319,1CO,9,KJV,i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air
10320,1CO,9,KJV,but i keep under my body and bring
10321,1CO,9,KJV,it
10322,1CO,9,KJV,into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway
10323,1CO,10,KJV,moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea
10324,1CO,10,KJV,and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea
10325,1CO,10,KJV,and did all eat the same spiritual meat
10326,1CO,10,KJV,and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ
10327,1CO,10,KJV,but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness
10328,1CO,10,KJV,now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted
10329,1CO,10,KJV,neither be ye idolaters as
10330,1CO,10,KJV,were
10331,1CO,10,KJV,some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
10332,1CO,10,KJV,neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand
10333,1CO,10,KJV,neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents
10334,1CO,10,KJV,neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer
10335,1CO,10,KJV,now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come
10336,1CO,10,KJV,wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall
10337,1CO,10,KJV,there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god
10338,1CO,10,KJV,is
10339,1CO,10,KJV,faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear
10340,1CO,10,KJV,it
10341,1CO,10,KJV,wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry
10342,1CO,10,KJV,i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say
10343,1CO,10,KJV,the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ
10344,1CO,10,KJV,for we
10345,1CO,10,KJV,being
10346,1CO,10,KJV,many are one bread
10347,1CO,10,KJV,and
10348,1CO,10,KJV,one body for we are all partakers of that one bread
10349,1CO,10,KJV,behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar
10350,1CO,10,KJV,what say i then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing
10351,1CO,10,KJV,but
10352,1CO,10,KJV,i say
10353,1CO,10,KJV,that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils
10354,1CO,10,KJV,ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils
10355,1CO,10,KJV,do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he
10356,1CO,10,KJV,all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not
10357,1CO,10,KJV,let no man seek his own but every man anothers
10358,1CO,10,KJV,wealth
10359,1CO,10,KJV,whatsoever is sold in the shambles
10360,1CO,10,KJV,that
10361,1CO,10,KJV,eat asking no question for conscience sake
10362,1CO,10,KJV,for the earth
10363,1CO,10,KJV,is
10364,1CO,10,KJV,the lords and the fulness thereof
10365,1CO,10,KJV,if any of them that believe not bid you
10366,1CO,10,KJV,to a feast
10367,1CO,10,KJV,and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake
10368,1CO,10,KJV,but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth
10369,1CO,10,KJV,is
10370,1CO,10,KJV,the lords and the fulness thereof
10371,1CO,10,KJV,conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another
10372,1CO,10,KJV,mans
10373,1CO,10,KJV,conscience
10374,1CO,10,KJV,for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks
10375,1CO,10,KJV,whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god
10376,1CO,10,KJV,give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god
10377,1CO,10,KJV,even as i please all
10378,1CO,10,KJV,men
10379,1CO,10,KJV,in all
10380,1CO,10,KJV,things
10381,1CO,10,KJV,not seeking mine own profit but the
10382,1CO,10,KJV,profit
10383,1CO,10,KJV,of many that they may be saved
10384,1CO,11,KJV,be ye followers of me even as i also
10385,1CO,11,KJV,am
10386,1CO,11,KJV,of christ
10387,1CO,11,KJV,now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered
10388,1CO,11,KJV,them
10389,1CO,11,KJV,to you
10390,1CO,11,KJV,but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman
10391,1CO,11,KJV,is
10392,1CO,11,KJV,the man and the head of christ
10393,1CO,11,KJV,is
10394,1CO,11,KJV,god
10395,1CO,11,KJV,every man praying or prophesying having
10396,1CO,11,KJV,his
10397,1CO,11,KJV,head covered dishonoureth his head
10398,1CO,11,KJV,but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with
10399,1CO,11,KJV,her
10400,1CO,11,KJV,head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven
10401,1CO,11,KJV,for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered
10402,1CO,11,KJV,for a man indeed ought not to cover
10403,1CO,11,KJV,his
10404,1CO,11,KJV,head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
10405,1CO,11,KJV,for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man
10406,1CO,11,KJV,neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man
10407,1CO,11,KJV,for this cause ought the woman to have power on
10408,1CO,11,KJV,her
10409,1CO,11,KJV,head because of the angels
10410,1CO,11,KJV,nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord
10411,1CO,11,KJV,for as the woman
10412,1CO,11,KJV,is
10413,1CO,11,KJV,of the man even so
10414,1CO,11,KJV,is
10415,1CO,11,KJV,the man also by the woman but all things of god
10416,1CO,11,KJV,judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered
10417,1CO,11,KJV,doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him
10418,1CO,11,KJV,but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for
10419,1CO,11,KJV,her
10420,1CO,11,KJV,hair is given her for a covering
10421,1CO,11,KJV,but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god
10422,1CO,11,KJV,now in this that i declare
10423,1CO,11,KJV,unto you
10424,1CO,11,KJV,i praise
10425,1CO,11,KJV,you
10426,1CO,11,KJV,not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse
10427,1CO,11,KJV,for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it
10428,1CO,11,KJV,for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you
10429,1CO,11,KJV,when ye come together therefore into one place
10430,1CO,11,KJV,this
10431,1CO,11,KJV,is not to eat the lords supper
10432,1CO,11,KJV,for in eating every one taketh before
10433,1CO,11,KJV,other
10434,1CO,11,KJV,his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken
10435,1CO,11,KJV,what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise
10436,1CO,11,KJV,you
10437,1CO,11,KJV,not
10438,1CO,11,KJV,for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the
10439,1CO,11,KJV,same
10440,1CO,11,KJV,night in which he was betrayed took bread
10441,1CO,11,KJV,and when he had given thanks he brake
10442,1CO,11,KJV,it
10443,1CO,11,KJV,and said
10444,1CO,11,KJV,take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me
10445,1CO,11,KJV,after the same manner also
10446,1CO,11,KJV,he took
10447,1CO,11,KJV,the cup when he had supped saying
10448,1CO,11,KJV,this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink
10449,1CO,11,KJV,it
10450,1CO,11,KJV,in remembrance of me
10451,1CO,11,KJV,for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come
10452,1CO,11,KJV,wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
10453,1CO,11,KJV,this
10454,1CO,11,KJV,cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord
10455,1CO,11,KJV,but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of
10456,1CO,11,KJV,that
10457,1CO,11,KJV,bread and drink of
10458,1CO,11,KJV,that
10459,1CO,11,KJV,cup
10460,1CO,11,KJV,for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body
10461,1CO,11,KJV,for this cause many
10462,1CO,11,KJV,are
10463,1CO,11,KJV,weak and sickly among you and many sleep
10464,1CO,11,KJV,for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
10465,1CO,11,KJV,but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world
10466,1CO,11,KJV,wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another
10467,1CO,11,KJV,and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come
10468,1CO,12,KJV,now concerning spiritual
10469,1CO,12,KJV,gifts
10470,1CO,12,KJV,brethren i would not have you ignorant
10471,1CO,12,KJV,ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led
10472,1CO,12,KJV,wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and
10473,1CO,12,KJV,that
10474,1CO,12,KJV,no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
10475,1CO,12,KJV,now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit
10476,1CO,12,KJV,and there are differences of administrations but the same lord
10477,1CO,12,KJV,and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all
10478,1CO,12,KJV,but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal
10479,1CO,12,KJV,for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit
10480,1CO,12,KJV,to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit
10481,1CO,12,KJV,to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another
10482,1CO,12,KJV,divers
10483,1CO,12,KJV,kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues
10484,1CO,12,KJV,but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will
10485,1CO,12,KJV,for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also
10486,1CO,12,KJV,is
10487,1CO,12,KJV,christ
10488,1CO,12,KJV,for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether
10489,1CO,12,KJV,we be
10490,1CO,12,KJV,jews or gentiles whether
10491,1CO,12,KJV,we be
10492,1CO,12,KJV,bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit
10493,1CO,12,KJV,for the body is not one member but many
10494,1CO,12,KJV,if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body
10495,1CO,12,KJV,and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body
10496,1CO,12,KJV,if the whole body
10497,1CO,12,KJV,were
10498,1CO,12,KJV,an eye where
10499,1CO,12,KJV,were
10500,1CO,12,KJV,the hearing if the whole
10501,1CO,12,KJV,were
10502,1CO,12,KJV,hearing where
10503,1CO,12,KJV,were
10504,1CO,12,KJV,the smelling
10505,1CO,12,KJV,but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him
10506,1CO,12,KJV,and if they were all one member where
10507,1CO,12,KJV,were
10508,1CO,12,KJV,the body
10509,1CO,12,KJV,but now
10510,1CO,12,KJV,are they
10511,1CO,12,KJV,many members yet but one body
10512,1CO,12,KJV,and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you
10513,1CO,12,KJV,nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary
10514,1CO,12,KJV,and those
10515,1CO,12,KJV,members
10516,1CO,12,KJV,of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely
10517,1CO,12,KJV,parts
10518,1CO,12,KJV,have more abundant comeliness
10519,1CO,12,KJV,for our comely
10520,1CO,12,KJV,parts
10521,1CO,12,KJV,have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that
10522,1CO,12,KJV,part
10523,1CO,12,KJV,which lacked
10524,1CO,12,KJV,that there should be no schism in the body but
10525,1CO,12,KJV,that
10526,1CO,12,KJV,the members should have the same care one for another
10527,1CO,12,KJV,and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it
10528,1CO,12,KJV,now ye are the body of christ and members in particular
10529,1CO,12,KJV,and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues
10530,1CO,12,KJV,are
10531,1CO,12,KJV,all apostles
10532,1CO,12,KJV,are
10533,1CO,12,KJV,all prophets
10534,1CO,12,KJV,are
10535,1CO,12,KJV,all teachers
10536,1CO,12,KJV,are
10537,1CO,12,KJV,all workers of miracles
10538,1CO,12,KJV,have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret
10539,1CO,12,KJV,but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way
10540,1CO,13,KJV,though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become
10541,1CO,13,KJV,as
10542,1CO,13,KJV,sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal
10543,1CO,13,KJV,and though i have
10544,1CO,13,KJV,the gift of
10545,1CO,13,KJV,prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing
10546,1CO,13,KJV,and though i bestow all my goods to feed
10547,1CO,13,KJV,the poor
10548,1CO,13,KJV,and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing
10549,1CO,13,KJV,charity suffereth long
10550,1CO,13,KJV,and
10551,1CO,13,KJV,is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
10552,1CO,13,KJV,doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
10553,1CO,13,KJV,rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
10554,1CO,13,KJV,beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things
10555,1CO,13,KJV,charity never faileth but whether
10556,1CO,13,KJV,there be
10557,1CO,13,KJV,prophecies they shall fail whether
10558,1CO,13,KJV,there be
10559,1CO,13,KJV,tongues they shall cease whether
10560,1CO,13,KJV,there be
10561,1CO,13,KJV,knowledge it shall vanish away
10562,1CO,13,KJV,for we know in part and we prophesy in part
10563,1CO,13,KJV,but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away
10564,1CO,13,KJV,when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things
10565,1CO,13,KJV,for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known
10566,1CO,13,KJV,and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these
10567,1CO,13,KJV,is
10568,1CO,13,KJV,charity
10569,1CO,14,KJV,follow after charity and desire spiritual
10570,1CO,14,KJV,gifts
10571,1CO,14,KJV,but rather that ye may prophesy
10572,1CO,14,KJV,for he that speaketh in an
10573,1CO,14,KJV,unknown
10574,1CO,14,KJV,tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth
10575,1CO,14,KJV,him
10576,1CO,14,KJV,howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries
10577,1CO,14,KJV,but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men
10578,1CO,14,KJV,to
10579,1CO,14,KJV,edification and exhortation and comfort
10580,1CO,14,KJV,he that speaketh in an
10581,1CO,14,KJV,unknown
10582,1CO,14,KJV,tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church
10583,1CO,14,KJV,i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater
10584,1CO,14,KJV,is
10585,1CO,14,KJV,he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying
10586,1CO,14,KJV,now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine
10587,1CO,14,KJV,and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped
10588,1CO,14,KJV,for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle
10589,1CO,14,KJV,so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air
10590,1CO,14,KJV,there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them
10591,1CO,14,KJV,is
10592,1CO,14,KJV,without signification
10593,1CO,14,KJV,therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh
10594,1CO,14,KJV,shall be
10595,1CO,14,KJV,a barbarian unto me
10596,1CO,14,KJV,even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual
10597,1CO,14,KJV,gifts
10598,1CO,14,KJV,seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church
10599,1CO,14,KJV,wherefore let him that speaketh in an
10600,1CO,14,KJV,unknown
10601,1CO,14,KJV,tongue pray that he may interpret
10602,1CO,14,KJV,for if i pray in an
10603,1CO,14,KJV,unknown
10604,1CO,14,KJV,tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful
10605,1CO,14,KJV,what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also
10606,1CO,14,KJV,else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest
10607,1CO,14,KJV,for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified
10608,1CO,14,KJV,i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all
10609,1CO,14,KJV,yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that
10610,1CO,14,KJV,by my voice
10611,1CO,14,KJV,i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an
10612,1CO,14,KJV,unknown
10613,1CO,14,KJV,tongue
10614,1CO,14,KJV,brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men
10615,1CO,14,KJV,in the law it is written with
10616,1CO,14,KJV,men of
10617,1CO,14,KJV,other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord
10618,1CO,14,KJV,wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying
10619,1CO,14,KJV,serveth
10620,1CO,14,KJV,not for them that believe not but for them which believe
10621,1CO,14,KJV,if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in
10622,1CO,14,KJV,those that are
10623,1CO,14,KJV,unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad
10624,1CO,14,KJV,but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or
10625,1CO,14,KJV,one
10626,1CO,14,KJV,unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all
10627,1CO,14,KJV,and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on
10628,1CO,14,KJV,his
10629,1CO,14,KJV,face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth
10630,1CO,14,KJV,how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying
10631,1CO,14,KJV,if any man speak in an
10632,1CO,14,KJV,unknown
10633,1CO,14,KJV,tongue
10634,1CO,14,KJV,let it be
10635,1CO,14,KJV,by two or at the most
10636,1CO,14,KJV,by
10637,1CO,14,KJV,three and
10638,1CO,14,KJV,that
10639,1CO,14,KJV,by course and let one interpret
10640,1CO,14,KJV,but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god
10641,1CO,14,KJV,let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge
10642,1CO,14,KJV,if
10643,1CO,14,KJV,any thing
10644,1CO,14,KJV,be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace
10645,1CO,14,KJV,for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted
10646,1CO,14,KJV,and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
10647,1CO,14,KJV,for god is not
10648,1CO,14,KJV,the author
10649,1CO,14,KJV,of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints
10650,1CO,14,KJV,let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but
10651,1CO,14,KJV,they are commanded
10652,1CO,14,KJV,to be under obedience as also saith the law
10653,1CO,14,KJV,and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
10654,1CO,14,KJV,what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only
10655,1CO,14,KJV,if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord
10656,1CO,14,KJV,but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant
10657,1CO,14,KJV,wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues
10658,1CO,14,KJV,let all things be done decently and in order
10659,1CO,15,KJV,moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand
10660,1CO,15,KJV,by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain
10661,1CO,15,KJV,for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
10662,1CO,15,KJV,and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
10663,1CO,15,KJV,and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve
10664,1CO,15,KJV,after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep
10665,1CO,15,KJV,after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles
10666,1CO,15,KJV,and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time
10667,1CO,15,KJV,for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god
10668,1CO,15,KJV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which
10669,1CO,15,KJV,was bestowed
10670,1CO,15,KJV,upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me
10671,1CO,15,KJV,therefore whether
10672,1CO,15,KJV,it were
10673,1CO,15,KJV,i or they so we preach and so ye believed
10674,1CO,15,KJV,now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead
10675,1CO,15,KJV,but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen
10676,1CO,15,KJV,and if christ be not risen then
10677,1CO,15,KJV,is
10678,1CO,15,KJV,our preaching vain and your faith
10679,1CO,15,KJV,is
10680,1CO,15,KJV,also vain
10681,1CO,15,KJV,yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not
10682,1CO,15,KJV,for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised
10683,1CO,15,KJV,and if christ be not raised your faith
10684,1CO,15,KJV,is
10685,1CO,15,KJV,vain ye are yet in your sins
10686,1CO,15,KJV,then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished
10687,1CO,15,KJV,if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable
10688,1CO,15,KJV,but now is christ risen from the dead
10689,1CO,15,KJV,and
10690,1CO,15,KJV,become the firstfruits of them that slept
10691,1CO,15,KJV,for since by man
10692,1CO,15,KJV,came
10693,1CO,15,KJV,death by man
10694,1CO,15,KJV,came
10695,1CO,15,KJV,also the resurrection of the dead
10696,1CO,15,KJV,for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
10697,1CO,15,KJV,but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming
10698,1CO,15,KJV,then
10699,1CO,15,KJV,cometh
10700,1CO,15,KJV,the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power
10701,1CO,15,KJV,for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet
10702,1CO,15,KJV,the last enemy
10703,1CO,15,KJV,that
10704,1CO,15,KJV,shall be destroyed
10705,1CO,15,KJV,is
10706,1CO,15,KJV,death
10707,1CO,15,KJV,for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under
10708,1CO,15,KJV,him it is
10709,1CO,15,KJV,manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him
10710,1CO,15,KJV,and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all
10711,1CO,15,KJV,else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead
10712,1CO,15,KJV,and why stand we in jeopardy every hour
10713,1CO,15,KJV,i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily
10714,1CO,15,KJV,if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die
10715,1CO,15,KJV,be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners
10716,1CO,15,KJV,awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak
10717,1CO,15,KJV,this
10718,1CO,15,KJV,to your shame
10719,1CO,15,KJV,but some
10720,1CO,15,KJV,man
10721,1CO,15,KJV,will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come
10722,1CO,15,KJV,thou
10723,1CO,15,KJV,fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die
10724,1CO,15,KJV,and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other
10725,1CO,15,KJV,grain
10726,1CO,15,KJV,
10727,1CO,15,KJV,but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body
10728,1CO,15,KJV,all flesh
10729,1CO,15,KJV,is
10730,1CO,15,KJV,not the same flesh but
10731,1CO,15,KJV,there is
10732,1CO,15,KJV,one
10733,1CO,15,KJV,kind of
10734,1CO,15,KJV,flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes
10735,1CO,15,KJV,and
10736,1CO,15,KJV,another of birds
10737,1CO,15,KJV,there are
10738,1CO,15,KJV,also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial
10739,1CO,15,KJV,is
10740,1CO,15,KJV,one and the
10741,1CO,15,KJV,glory
10742,1CO,15,KJV,of the terrestrial
10743,1CO,15,KJV,is
10744,1CO,15,KJV,another
10745,1CO,15,KJV,there is
10746,1CO,15,KJV,one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for
10747,1CO,15,KJV,one
10748,1CO,15,KJV,star differeth from
10749,1CO,15,KJV,another
10750,1CO,15,KJV,star in glory
10751,1CO,15,KJV,so also
10752,1CO,15,KJV,is
10753,1CO,15,KJV,the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption
10754,1CO,15,KJV,it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power
10755,1CO,15,KJV,it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body
10756,1CO,15,KJV,and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam
10757,1CO,15,KJV,was made
10758,1CO,15,KJV,a quickening spirit
10759,1CO,15,KJV,howbeit that
10760,1CO,15,KJV,was
10761,1CO,15,KJV,not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual
10762,1CO,15,KJV,the first man
10763,1CO,15,KJV,is
10764,1CO,15,KJV,of the earth earthy the second man
10765,1CO,15,KJV,is
10766,1CO,15,KJV,the lord from heaven
10767,1CO,15,KJV,as
10768,1CO,15,KJV,is
10769,1CO,15,KJV,the earthy such
10770,1CO,15,KJV,are
10771,1CO,15,KJV,they also that are earthy and as
10772,1CO,15,KJV,is
10773,1CO,15,KJV,the heavenly such
10774,1CO,15,KJV,are
10775,1CO,15,KJV,they also that are heavenly
10776,1CO,15,KJV,and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly
10777,1CO,15,KJV,now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
10778,1CO,15,KJV,behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed
10779,1CO,15,KJV,in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
10780,1CO,15,KJV,for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal
10781,1CO,15,KJV,must
10782,1CO,15,KJV,put on immortality
10783,1CO,15,KJV,so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
10784,1CO,15,KJV,o death where
10785,1CO,15,KJV,is
10786,1CO,15,KJV,thy sting o grave where
10787,1CO,15,KJV,is
10788,1CO,15,KJV,thy victory
10789,1CO,15,KJV,the sting of death
10790,1CO,15,KJV,is
10791,1CO,15,KJV,sin and the strength of sin
10792,1CO,15,KJV,is
10793,1CO,15,KJV,the law
10794,1CO,15,KJV,but thanks
10795,1CO,15,KJV,be
10796,1CO,15,KJV,to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ
10797,1CO,15,KJV,therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord
10798,1CO,16,KJV,now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye
10799,1CO,16,KJV,upon the first
10800,1CO,16,KJV,day
10801,1CO,16,KJV,of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as
10802,1CO,16,KJV,god
10803,1CO,16,KJV,hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come
10804,1CO,16,KJV,and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by
10805,1CO,16,KJV,your
10806,1CO,16,KJV,letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem
10807,1CO,16,KJV,and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me
10808,1CO,16,KJV,now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia
10809,1CO,16,KJV,and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go
10810,1CO,16,KJV,for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit
10811,1CO,16,KJV,but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost
10812,1CO,16,KJV,for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and
10813,1CO,16,KJV,there are
10814,1CO,16,KJV,many adversaries
10815,1CO,16,KJV,now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also
10816,1CO,16,KJV,do
10817,1CO,16,KJV,
10818,1CO,16,KJV,let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren
10819,1CO,16,KJV,as touching
10820,1CO,16,KJV,our
10821,1CO,16,KJV,brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time
10822,1CO,16,KJV,watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong
10823,1CO,16,KJV,let all your things be done with charity
10824,1CO,16,KJV,i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and
10825,1CO,16,KJV,that
10826,1CO,16,KJV,they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints
10827,1CO,16,KJV,that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with
10828,1CO,16,KJV,us
10829,1CO,16,KJV,and laboureth
10830,1CO,16,KJV,i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied
10831,1CO,16,KJV,for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge ye them that are such
10832,1CO,16,KJV,the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house
10833,1CO,16,KJV,all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss
10834,1CO,16,KJV,the salutation of
10835,1CO,16,KJV,me
10836,1CO,16,KJV,paul with mine own hand
10837,1CO,16,KJV,if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha
10838,1CO,16,KJV,the grace of our lord jesus christ
10839,1CO,16,KJV,be
10840,1CO,16,KJV,with you
10841,1CO,16,KJV,my love
10842,1CO,16,KJV,be
10843,1CO,16,KJV,with you all in christ jesus amen
10844,1CO,16,KJV,the first epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi by stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus and timotheus
10845,2CO,1,KJV,paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy
10846,2CO,1,KJV,our
10847,2CO,1,KJV,brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saints which are in all achaia
10848,2CO,1,KJV,grace
10849,2CO,1,KJV,be
10850,2CO,1,KJV,to you and peace from god our father and
10851,2CO,1,KJV,from
10852,2CO,1,KJV,the lord jesus christ
10853,2CO,1,KJV,blessed
10854,2CO,1,KJV,be
10855,2CO,1,KJV,god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort
10856,2CO,1,KJV,who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god
10857,2CO,1,KJV,for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ
10858,2CO,1,KJV,and whether we be afflicted
10859,2CO,1,KJV,it is
10860,2CO,1,KJV,for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted
10861,2CO,1,KJV,it is
10862,2CO,1,KJV,for your consolation and salvation
10863,2CO,1,KJV,and our hope of you
10864,2CO,1,KJV,is
10865,2CO,1,KJV,stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so
10866,2CO,1,KJV,shall ye be
10867,2CO,1,KJV,also of the consolation
10868,2CO,1,KJV,for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of life
10869,2CO,1,KJV,but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead
10870,2CO,1,KJV,who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver
10871,2CO,1,KJV,us
10872,2CO,1,KJV,
10873,2CO,1,KJV,ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift
10874,2CO,1,KJV,bestowed
10875,2CO,1,KJV,upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf
10876,2CO,1,KJV,for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to youward
10877,2CO,1,KJV,for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end
10878,2CO,1,KJV,as also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also
10879,2CO,1,KJV,are
10880,2CO,1,KJV,ours in the day of the lord jesus
10881,2CO,1,KJV,and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefit
10882,2CO,1,KJV,and to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea
10883,2CO,1,KJV,when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay
10884,2CO,1,KJV,but
10885,2CO,1,KJV,as
10886,2CO,1,KJV,god
10887,2CO,1,KJV,is
10888,2CO,1,KJV,true our word toward you was not yea and nay
10889,2CO,1,KJV,for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us
10890,2CO,1,KJV,even
10891,2CO,1,KJV,by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea
10892,2CO,1,KJV,for all the promises of god in him
10893,2CO,1,KJV,are
10894,2CO,1,KJV,yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us
10895,2CO,1,KJV,now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed us
10896,2CO,1,KJV,is
10897,2CO,1,KJV,god
10898,2CO,1,KJV,who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts
10899,2CO,1,KJV,moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth
10900,2CO,1,KJV,not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye stand
10901,2CO,2,KJV,but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness
10902,2CO,2,KJV,for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me
10903,2CO,2,KJV,and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is
10904,2CO,2,KJV,the joy
10905,2CO,2,KJV,of you all
10906,2CO,2,KJV,for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you
10907,2CO,2,KJV,but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all
10908,2CO,2,KJV,sufficient to such a man
10909,2CO,2,KJV,is
10910,2CO,2,KJV,this punishment which
10911,2CO,2,KJV,was inflicted
10912,2CO,2,KJV,of many
10913,2CO,2,KJV,so that contrariwise ye
10914,2CO,2,KJV,ought
10915,2CO,2,KJV,rather to forgive
10916,2CO,2,KJV,him
10917,2CO,2,KJV,and comfort
10918,2CO,2,KJV,him
10919,2CO,2,KJV,lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
10920,2CO,2,KJV,wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm
10921,2CO,2,KJV,your
10922,2CO,2,KJV,love toward him
10923,2CO,2,KJV,for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things
10924,2CO,2,KJV,to whom ye forgive any thing i
10925,2CO,2,KJV,forgive
10926,2CO,2,KJV,also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave
10927,2CO,2,KJV,it
10928,2CO,2,KJV,for your sakes
10929,2CO,2,KJV,forgave i it
10930,2CO,2,KJV,in the person of christ
10931,2CO,2,KJV,lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices
10932,2CO,2,KJV,furthermore when i came to troas to
10933,2CO,2,KJV,preach
10934,2CO,2,KJV,christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord
10935,2CO,2,KJV,i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia
10936,2CO,2,KJV,now thanks
10937,2CO,2,KJV,be
10938,2CO,2,KJV,unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place
10939,2CO,2,KJV,for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish
10940,2CO,2,KJV,to the one
10941,2CO,2,KJV,we are
10942,2CO,2,KJV,the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and who
10943,2CO,2,KJV,is
10944,2CO,2,KJV,sufficient for these things
10945,2CO,2,KJV,for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ
10946,2CO,3,KJV,do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some
10947,2CO,3,KJV,others
10948,2CO,3,KJV,epistles of commendation to you or
10949,2CO,3,KJV,letters
10950,2CO,3,KJV,of commendation from you
10951,2CO,3,KJV,ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men
10952,2CO,3,KJV,forasmuch as ye are
10953,2CO,3,KJV,manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart
10954,2CO,3,KJV,and such trust have we through christ to godward
10955,2CO,3,KJV,not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency
10956,2CO,3,KJV,is
10957,2CO,3,KJV,of god
10958,2CO,3,KJV,who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life
10959,2CO,3,KJV,but if the ministration of death written
10960,2CO,3,KJV,and
10961,2CO,3,KJV,engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which
10962,2CO,3,KJV,glory
10963,2CO,3,KJV,was to be done away
10964,2CO,3,KJV,how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious
10965,2CO,3,KJV,for if the ministration of condemnation
10966,2CO,3,KJV,be
10967,2CO,3,KJV,glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory
10968,2CO,3,KJV,for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth
10969,2CO,3,KJV,for if that which is done away
10970,2CO,3,KJV,was
10971,2CO,3,KJV,glorious much more that which remaineth
10972,2CO,3,KJV,is
10973,2CO,3,KJV,glorious
10974,2CO,3,KJV,seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech
10975,2CO,3,KJV,and not as moses
10976,2CO,3,KJV,which
10977,2CO,3,KJV,put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished
10978,2CO,3,KJV,but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which
10979,2CO,3,KJV,vail
10980,2CO,3,KJV,is done away in christ
10981,2CO,3,KJV,but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart
10982,2CO,3,KJV,nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away
10983,2CO,3,KJV,now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord
10984,2CO,3,KJV,is
10985,2CO,3,KJV,there
10986,2CO,3,KJV,is
10987,2CO,3,KJV,liberty
10988,2CO,3,KJV,but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory
10989,2CO,3,KJV,even
10990,2CO,3,KJV,as by the spirit of the lord
10991,2CO,4,KJV,therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not
10992,2CO,4,KJV,but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god
10993,2CO,4,KJV,but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost
10994,2CO,4,KJV,in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
10995,2CO,4,KJV,for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake
10996,2CO,4,KJV,for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to
10997,2CO,4,KJV,give
10998,2CO,4,KJV,the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
10999,2CO,4,KJV,but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us
11000,2CO,4,KJV,we are
11001,2CO,4,KJV,troubled on every side yet not distressed
11002,2CO,4,KJV,we are
11003,2CO,4,KJV,perplexed but not in despair
11004,2CO,4,KJV,persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed
11005,2CO,4,KJV,always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body
11006,2CO,4,KJV,for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
11007,2CO,4,KJV,so then death worketh in us but life in you
11008,2CO,4,KJV,we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak
11009,2CO,4,KJV,knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present
11010,2CO,4,KJV,us
11011,2CO,4,KJV,with you
11012,2CO,4,KJV,for all things
11013,2CO,4,KJV,are
11014,2CO,4,KJV,for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god
11015,2CO,4,KJV,for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward
11016,2CO,4,KJV,man
11017,2CO,4,KJV,is renewed day by day
11018,2CO,4,KJV,for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding
11019,2CO,4,KJV,and
11020,2CO,4,KJV,eternal weight of glory
11021,2CO,4,KJV,while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen
11022,2CO,4,KJV,are
11023,2CO,4,KJV,temporal but the things which are not seen
11024,2CO,4,KJV,are
11025,2CO,4,KJV,eternal
11026,2CO,5,KJV,for we know that if our earthly house of
11027,2CO,5,KJV,this
11028,2CO,5,KJV,tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
11029,2CO,5,KJV,for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven
11030,2CO,5,KJV,if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked
11031,2CO,5,KJV,for we that are in
11032,2CO,5,KJV,this
11033,2CO,5,KJV,tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life
11034,2CO,5,KJV,now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing
11035,2CO,5,KJV,is
11036,2CO,5,KJV,god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit
11037,2CO,5,KJV,therefore
11038,2CO,5,KJV,we are
11039,2CO,5,KJV,always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord
11040,2CO,5,KJV,for we walk by faith not by sight
11041,2CO,5,KJV,we are confident
11042,2CO,5,KJV,i say
11043,2CO,5,KJV,and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord
11044,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him
11045,2CO,5,KJV,for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things
11046,2CO,5,KJV,done
11047,2CO,5,KJV,in
11048,2CO,5,KJV,his
11049,2CO,5,KJV,body according to that he hath done whether
11050,2CO,5,KJV,it be
11051,2CO,5,KJV,good or bad
11052,2CO,5,KJV,knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences
11053,2CO,5,KJV,for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to
11054,2CO,5,KJV,answer
11055,2CO,5,KJV,them which glory in appearance and not in heart
11056,2CO,5,KJV,for whether we be beside ourselves
11057,2CO,5,KJV,it is
11058,2CO,5,KJV,to god or whether we be sober
11059,2CO,5,KJV,it is
11060,2CO,5,KJV,for your cause
11061,2CO,5,KJV,for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead
11062,2CO,5,KJV,and
11063,2CO,5,KJV,that
11064,2CO,5,KJV,he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again
11065,2CO,5,KJV,wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we
11066,2CO,5,KJV,him
11067,2CO,5,KJV,no more
11068,2CO,5,KJV,therefore if any man
11069,2CO,5,KJV,be
11070,2CO,5,KJV,in christ
11071,2CO,5,KJV,he is
11072,2CO,5,KJV,a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
11073,2CO,5,KJV,and all things
11074,2CO,5,KJV,are
11075,2CO,5,KJV,of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation
11076,2CO,5,KJV,to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation
11077,2CO,5,KJV,now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech
11078,2CO,5,KJV,you
11079,2CO,5,KJV,by us we pray
11080,2CO,5,KJV,you
11081,2CO,5,KJV,in christs stead be ye reconciled to god
11082,2CO,5,KJV,for he hath made him
11083,2CO,5,KJV,to be
11084,2CO,5,KJV,sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
11085,2CO,6,KJV,we then
11086,2CO,6,KJV,as
11087,2CO,6,KJV,workers together
11088,2CO,6,KJV,with him
11089,2CO,6,KJV,beseech
11090,2CO,6,KJV,you
11091,2CO,6,KJV,also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain
11092,2CO,6,KJV,for he saith
11093,2CO,6,KJV,i have heard thee in a time accepted
11094,2CO,6,KJV,and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee
11095,2CO,6,KJV,behold now
11096,2CO,6,KJV,is
11097,2CO,6,KJV,the accepted time behold now
11098,2CO,6,KJV,is
11099,2CO,6,KJV,the day of salvation
11100,2CO,6,KJV,giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed
11101,2CO,6,KJV,but in all
11102,2CO,6,KJV,things
11103,2CO,6,KJV,approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses
11104,2CO,6,KJV,in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings
11105,2CO,6,KJV,by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned
11106,2CO,6,KJV,by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
11107,2CO,6,KJV,by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and
11108,2CO,6,KJV,yet
11109,2CO,6,KJV,true
11110,2CO,6,KJV,as unknown and
11111,2CO,6,KJV,yet
11112,2CO,6,KJV,well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed
11113,2CO,6,KJV,as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and
11114,2CO,6,KJV,yet
11115,2CO,6,KJV,possessing all things
11116,2CO,6,KJV,o
11117,2CO,6,KJV,ye
11118,2CO,6,KJV,corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged
11119,2CO,6,KJV,ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels
11120,2CO,6,KJV,now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto
11121,2CO,6,KJV,my
11122,2CO,6,KJV,children be ye also enlarged
11123,2CO,6,KJV,be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
11124,2CO,6,KJV,and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel
11125,2CO,6,KJV,and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in
11126,2CO,6,KJV,them
11127,2CO,6,KJV,and i will be their god and they shall be my people
11128,2CO,6,KJV,wherefore
11129,2CO,6,KJV,come out from among them and be ye separate
11130,2CO,6,KJV,saith the lord
11131,2CO,6,KJV,and touch not the unclean
11132,2CO,6,KJV,thing
11133,2CO,6,KJV,and i will receive you
11134,2CO,6,KJV,and will be a father unto you
11135,2CO,6,KJV,and ye shall be my sons and daughters
11136,2CO,6,KJV,saith the lord almighty
11137,2CO,7,KJV,having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
11138,2CO,7,KJV,receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man
11139,2CO,7,KJV,i speak not
11140,2CO,7,KJV,this
11141,2CO,7,KJV,to condemn
11142,2CO,7,KJV,you
11143,2CO,7,KJV,for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with
11144,2CO,7,KJV,you
11145,2CO,7,KJV,
11146,2CO,7,KJV,great
11147,2CO,7,KJV,is
11148,2CO,7,KJV,my boldness of speech toward you great
11149,2CO,7,KJV,is
11150,2CO,7,KJV,my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation
11151,2CO,7,KJV,for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without
11152,2CO,7,KJV,were
11153,2CO,7,KJV,fightings within
11154,2CO,7,KJV,were
11155,2CO,7,KJV,fears
11156,2CO,7,KJV,nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus
11157,2CO,7,KJV,and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more
11158,2CO,7,KJV,for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though
11159,2CO,7,KJV,it were
11160,2CO,7,KJV,but for a season
11161,2CO,7,KJV,now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing
11162,2CO,7,KJV,for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
11163,2CO,7,KJV,for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea
11164,2CO,7,KJV,what
11165,2CO,7,KJV,clearing of yourselves yea
11166,2CO,7,KJV,what
11167,2CO,7,KJV,indignation yea
11168,2CO,7,KJV,what
11169,2CO,7,KJV,fear yea
11170,2CO,7,KJV,what
11171,2CO,7,KJV,vehement desire yea
11172,2CO,7,KJV,what
11173,2CO,7,KJV,zeal yea
11174,2CO,7,KJV,what
11175,2CO,7,KJV,revenge in all
11176,2CO,7,KJV,things
11177,2CO,7,KJV,ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter
11178,2CO,7,KJV,wherefore though i wrote unto you
11179,2CO,7,KJV,i did it
11180,2CO,7,KJV,not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you
11181,2CO,7,KJV,therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all
11182,2CO,7,KJV,for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which
11183,2CO,7,KJV,i made
11184,2CO,7,KJV,before titus is found a truth
11185,2CO,7,KJV,and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him
11186,2CO,7,KJV,i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all
11187,2CO,7,KJV,things
11188,2CO,8,KJV,moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia
11189,2CO,8,KJV,how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality
11190,2CO,8,KJV,for to
11191,2CO,8,KJV,their
11192,2CO,8,KJV,power i bear record yea and beyond
11193,2CO,8,KJV,their
11194,2CO,8,KJV,power
11195,2CO,8,KJV,they were
11196,2CO,8,KJV,willing of themselves
11197,2CO,8,KJV,praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and
11198,2CO,8,KJV,take upon us
11199,2CO,8,KJV,the fellowship of the ministering to the saints
11200,2CO,8,KJV,and
11201,2CO,8,KJV,this they did
11202,2CO,8,KJV,not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god
11203,2CO,8,KJV,insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also
11204,2CO,8,KJV,therefore as ye abound in every
11205,2CO,8,KJV,thing in
11206,2CO,8,KJV,faith and utterance and knowledge and
11207,2CO,8,KJV,in
11208,2CO,8,KJV,all diligence and
11209,2CO,8,KJV,in
11210,2CO,8,KJV,your love to us
11211,2CO,8,KJV,see
11212,2CO,8,KJV,that ye abound in this grace also
11213,2CO,8,KJV,i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love
11214,2CO,8,KJV,for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich
11215,2CO,8,KJV,and herein i give
11216,2CO,8,KJV,my
11217,2CO,8,KJV,advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago
11218,2CO,8,KJV,now therefore perform the doing
11219,2CO,8,KJV,of it
11220,2CO,8,KJV,that as
11221,2CO,8,KJV,there was
11222,2CO,8,KJV,a readiness to will so
11223,2CO,8,KJV,there may be
11224,2CO,8,KJV,a performance also out of that which ye have
11225,2CO,8,KJV,for if there be first a willing mind
11226,2CO,8,KJV,it is
11227,2CO,8,KJV,accepted according to that a man hath
11228,2CO,8,KJV,and
11229,2CO,8,KJV,not according to that he hath not
11230,2CO,8,KJV,for
11231,2CO,8,KJV,i mean
11232,2CO,8,KJV,not that other men be eased and ye burdened
11233,2CO,8,KJV,but by an equality
11234,2CO,8,KJV,that
11235,2CO,8,KJV,now at this time your abundance
11236,2CO,8,KJV,may be a supply
11237,2CO,8,KJV,for their want that their abundance also may be
11238,2CO,8,KJV,a supply
11239,2CO,8,KJV,for your want that there may be equality
11240,2CO,8,KJV,as it is written he that
11241,2CO,8,KJV,had gathered
11242,2CO,8,KJV,much had nothing over and he that
11243,2CO,8,KJV,had gathered
11244,2CO,8,KJV,little had no lack
11245,2CO,8,KJV,but thanks
11246,2CO,8,KJV,be
11247,2CO,8,KJV,to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you
11248,2CO,8,KJV,for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you
11249,2CO,8,KJV,and we have sent with him the brother whose praise
11250,2CO,8,KJV,is
11251,2CO,8,KJV,in the gospel throughout all the churches
11252,2CO,8,KJV,and not
11253,2CO,8,KJV,that
11254,2CO,8,KJV,only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and
11255,2CO,8,KJV,declaration of
11256,2CO,8,KJV,your ready mind
11257,2CO,8,KJV,avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us
11258,2CO,8,KJV,providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men
11259,2CO,8,KJV,and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which
11260,2CO,8,KJV,i have
11261,2CO,8,KJV,in you
11262,2CO,8,KJV,whether
11263,2CO,8,KJV,any do enquire
11264,2CO,8,KJV,of titus
11265,2CO,8,KJV,he is
11266,2CO,8,KJV,my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren
11267,2CO,8,KJV,be enquired of they are
11268,2CO,8,KJV,the messengers of the churches
11269,2CO,8,KJV,and
11270,2CO,8,KJV,the glory of christ
11271,2CO,8,KJV,wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf
11272,2CO,9,KJV,for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you
11273,2CO,9,KJV,for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many
11274,2CO,9,KJV,yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready
11275,2CO,9,KJV,lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting
11276,2CO,9,KJV,therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as
11277,2CO,9,KJV,a matter of
11278,2CO,9,KJV,bounty and not as
11279,2CO,9,KJV,of
11280,2CO,9,KJV,covetousness
11281,2CO,9,KJV,but this
11282,2CO,9,KJV,i say
11283,2CO,9,KJV,he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully
11284,2CO,9,KJV,every man according as he purposeth in his heart
11285,2CO,9,KJV,so let him give
11286,2CO,9,KJV,not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver
11287,2CO,9,KJV,and god
11288,2CO,9,KJV,is
11289,2CO,9,KJV,able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all
11290,2CO,9,KJV,things
11291,2CO,9,KJV,may abound to every good work
11292,2CO,9,KJV,as it is written
11293,2CO,9,KJV,he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor
11294,2CO,9,KJV,his righteousness remaineth for ever
11295,2CO,9,KJV,now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
11296,2CO,9,KJV,your
11297,2CO,9,KJV,food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness
11298,2CO,9,KJV,being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god
11299,2CO,9,KJV,for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god
11300,2CO,9,KJV,whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for
11301,2CO,9,KJV,your
11302,2CO,9,KJV,liberal distribution unto them and unto all
11303,2CO,9,KJV,men
11304,2CO,9,KJV,
11305,2CO,9,KJV,and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you
11306,2CO,9,KJV,thanks
11307,2CO,9,KJV,be
11308,2CO,9,KJV,unto god for his unspeakable gift
11309,2CO,10,KJV,now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence
11310,2CO,10,KJV,am
11311,2CO,10,KJV,base among you but being absent am bold toward you
11312,2CO,10,KJV,but i beseech
11313,2CO,10,KJV,you
11314,2CO,10,KJV,that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh
11315,2CO,10,KJV,for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh
11316,2CO,10,KJV,for the weapons of our warfare
11317,2CO,10,KJV,are
11318,2CO,10,KJV,not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds
11319,2CO,10,KJV,casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
11320,2CO,10,KJV,and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled
11321,2CO,10,KJV,do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think this again that as he
11322,2CO,10,KJV,is
11323,2CO,10,KJV,christs even so
11324,2CO,10,KJV,are
11325,2CO,10,KJV,we christs
11326,2CO,10,KJV,for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed
11327,2CO,10,KJV,that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters
11328,2CO,10,KJV,for
11329,2CO,10,KJV,his
11330,2CO,10,KJV,letters say they
11331,2CO,10,KJV,are
11332,2CO,10,KJV,weighty and powerful but
11333,2CO,10,KJV,his
11334,2CO,10,KJV,bodily presence
11335,2CO,10,KJV,is
11336,2CO,10,KJV,weak and
11337,2CO,10,KJV,his
11338,2CO,10,KJV,speech contemptible
11339,2CO,10,KJV,let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such
11340,2CO,10,KJV,will we be
11341,2CO,10,KJV,also in deed when we are present
11342,2CO,10,KJV,for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise
11343,2CO,10,KJV,but we will not boast of things without
11344,2CO,10,KJV,our
11345,2CO,10,KJV,measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you
11346,2CO,10,KJV,for we stretch not ourselves beyond
11347,2CO,10,KJV,our measure
11348,2CO,10,KJV,as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in
11349,2CO,10,KJV,preaching
11350,2CO,10,KJV,the gospel of christ
11351,2CO,10,KJV,not boasting of things without
11352,2CO,10,KJV,our
11353,2CO,10,KJV,measure
11354,2CO,10,KJV,that is
11355,2CO,10,KJV,of other mens labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly
11356,2CO,10,KJV,to preach the gospel in the
11357,2CO,10,KJV,regions
11358,2CO,10,KJV,beyond you
11359,2CO,10,KJV,and
11360,2CO,10,KJV,not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our hand
11361,2CO,10,KJV,but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord
11362,2CO,10,KJV,for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth
11363,2CO,11,KJV,would to god ye could bear with me a little in
11364,2CO,11,KJV,my
11365,2CO,11,KJV,folly and indeed bear with me
11366,2CO,11,KJV,for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present
11367,2CO,11,KJV,you as
11368,2CO,11,KJV,a chaste virgin to christ
11369,2CO,11,KJV,but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ
11370,2CO,11,KJV,for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or
11371,2CO,11,KJV,if
11372,2CO,11,KJV,ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with
11373,2CO,11,KJV,him
11374,2CO,11,KJV,
11375,2CO,11,KJV,for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles
11376,2CO,11,KJV,but though
11377,2CO,11,KJV,i be
11378,2CO,11,KJV,rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things
11379,2CO,11,KJV,have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely
11380,2CO,11,KJV,i robbed other churches taking wages
11381,2CO,11,KJV,of them
11382,2CO,11,KJV,to do you service
11383,2CO,11,KJV,and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all
11384,2CO,11,KJV,things
11385,2CO,11,KJV,i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and
11386,2CO,11,KJV,so
11387,2CO,11,KJV,will i keep
11388,2CO,11,KJV,myself
11389,2CO,11,KJV,
11390,2CO,11,KJV,as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia
11391,2CO,11,KJV,wherefore because i love you not god knoweth
11392,2CO,11,KJV,but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we
11393,2CO,11,KJV,for such
11394,2CO,11,KJV,are
11395,2CO,11,KJV,false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ
11396,2CO,11,KJV,and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light
11397,2CO,11,KJV,therefore
11398,2CO,11,KJV,it is
11399,2CO,11,KJV,no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
11400,2CO,11,KJV,i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little
11401,2CO,11,KJV,that which i speak i speak
11402,2CO,11,KJV,it
11403,2CO,11,KJV,not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting
11404,2CO,11,KJV,seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also
11405,2CO,11,KJV,for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye
11406,2CO,11,KJV,yourselves
11407,2CO,11,KJV,are wise
11408,2CO,11,KJV,for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour
11409,2CO,11,KJV,you
11410,2CO,11,KJV,if a man take
11411,2CO,11,KJV,of you
11412,2CO,11,KJV,if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face
11413,2CO,11,KJV,i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also
11414,2CO,11,KJV,are they hebrews so
11415,2CO,11,KJV,am
11416,2CO,11,KJV,i are they israelites so
11417,2CO,11,KJV,am
11418,2CO,11,KJV,i are they the seed of abraham so
11419,2CO,11,KJV,am
11420,2CO,11,KJV,i
11421,2CO,11,KJV,are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i
11422,2CO,11,KJV,am
11423,2CO,11,KJV,more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft
11424,2CO,11,KJV,of the jews five times received i forty
11425,2CO,11,KJV,stripes
11426,2CO,11,KJV,save one
11427,2CO,11,KJV,thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep
11428,2CO,11,KJV,in
11429,2CO,11,KJV,journeyings often
11430,2CO,11,KJV,in
11431,2CO,11,KJV,perils of waters
11432,2CO,11,KJV,in
11433,2CO,11,KJV,perils of robbers
11434,2CO,11,KJV,in
11435,2CO,11,KJV,perils by
11436,2CO,11,KJV,mine own
11437,2CO,11,KJV,countrymen
11438,2CO,11,KJV,in
11439,2CO,11,KJV,perils by the heathen
11440,2CO,11,KJV,in
11441,2CO,11,KJV,perils in the city
11442,2CO,11,KJV,in
11443,2CO,11,KJV,perils in the wilderness
11444,2CO,11,KJV,in
11445,2CO,11,KJV,perils in the sea
11446,2CO,11,KJV,in
11447,2CO,11,KJV,perils among false brethren
11448,2CO,11,KJV,in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness
11449,2CO,11,KJV,beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches
11450,2CO,11,KJV,who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not
11451,2CO,11,KJV,if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities
11452,2CO,11,KJV,the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not
11453,2CO,11,KJV,in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me
11454,2CO,11,KJV,and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands
11455,2CO,12,KJV,it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord
11456,2CO,12,KJV,i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven
11457,2CO,12,KJV,and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth
11458,2CO,12,KJV,how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
11459,2CO,12,KJV,of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities
11460,2CO,12,KJV,for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but
11461,2CO,12,KJV,now
11462,2CO,12,KJV,i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me
11463,2CO,12,KJV,to be
11464,2CO,12,KJV,or
11465,2CO,12,KJV,that
11466,2CO,12,KJV,he heareth of me
11467,2CO,12,KJV,and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure
11468,2CO,12,KJV,for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me
11469,2CO,12,KJV,and he said unto me
11470,2CO,12,KJV,my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness
11471,2CO,12,KJV,most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me
11472,2CO,12,KJV,therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong
11473,2CO,12,KJV,i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing
11474,2CO,12,KJV,truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds
11475,2CO,12,KJV,for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except
11476,2CO,12,KJV,it be
11477,2CO,12,KJV,that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this wrong
11478,2CO,12,KJV,behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children
11479,2CO,12,KJV,and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved
11480,2CO,12,KJV,but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile
11481,2CO,12,KJV,did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you
11482,2CO,12,KJV,i desired titus and with
11483,2CO,12,KJV,him
11484,2CO,12,KJV,i sent a brother did titus make a gain of you walked we not in the same spirit
11485,2CO,12,KJV,walked we
11486,2CO,12,KJV,not in the same steps
11487,2CO,12,KJV,again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before god in christ but
11488,2CO,12,KJV,we do
11489,2CO,12,KJV,all things dearly beloved for your edifying
11490,2CO,12,KJV,for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and
11491,2CO,12,KJV,that
11492,2CO,12,KJV,i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest
11493,2CO,12,KJV,there be
11494,2CO,12,KJV,debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults
11495,2CO,12,KJV,and
11496,2CO,12,KJV,lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and
11497,2CO,12,KJV,that
11498,2CO,12,KJV,i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed
11499,2CO,13,KJV,this
11500,2CO,13,KJV,is
11501,2CO,13,KJV,the third
11502,2CO,13,KJV,time
11503,2CO,13,KJV,i am coming to you in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established
11504,2CO,13,KJV,i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare
11505,2CO,13,KJV,since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to youward is not weak but is mighty in you
11506,2CO,13,KJV,for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you
11507,2CO,13,KJV,examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates
11508,2CO,13,KJV,but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates
11509,2CO,13,KJV,now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates
11510,2CO,13,KJV,for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth
11511,2CO,13,KJV,for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish
11512,2CO,13,KJV,even
11513,2CO,13,KJV,your perfection
11514,2CO,13,KJV,therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction
11515,2CO,13,KJV,finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you
11516,2CO,13,KJV,greet one another with an holy kiss
11517,2CO,13,KJV,all the saints salute you
11518,2CO,13,KJV,the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost
11519,2CO,13,KJV,be
11520,2CO,13,KJV,with you all amen
11521,2CO,13,KJV,the second epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi a city of macedonia by titus and lucas
11522,GAL,1,KJV,paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead
11523,GAL,1,KJV,and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia
11524,GAL,1,KJV,grace
11525,GAL,1,KJV,be
11526,GAL,1,KJV,to you and peace from god the father and
11527,GAL,1,KJV,from
11528,GAL,1,KJV,our lord jesus christ
11529,GAL,1,KJV,who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father
11530,GAL,1,KJV,to whom
11531,GAL,1,KJV,be
11532,GAL,1,KJV,glory for ever and ever amen
11533,GAL,1,KJV,i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel
11534,GAL,1,KJV,which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ
11535,GAL,1,KJV,but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed
11536,GAL,1,KJV,as we said before so say i now again if any
11537,GAL,1,KJV,man
11538,GAL,1,KJV,preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed
11539,GAL,1,KJV,for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ
11540,GAL,1,KJV,but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man
11541,GAL,1,KJV,for i neither received it of man neither was i taught
11542,GAL,1,KJV,it
11543,GAL,1,KJV,but by the revelation of jesus christ
11544,GAL,1,KJV,for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it
11545,GAL,1,KJV,and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers
11546,GAL,1,KJV,but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called
11547,GAL,1,KJV,me
11548,GAL,1,KJV,by his grace
11549,GAL,1,KJV,to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood
11550,GAL,1,KJV,neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus
11551,GAL,1,KJV,then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days
11552,GAL,1,KJV,but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lords brother
11553,GAL,1,KJV,now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not
11554,GAL,1,KJV,afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia
11555,GAL,1,KJV,and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ
11556,GAL,1,KJV,but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed
11557,GAL,1,KJV,and they glorified god in me
11558,GAL,2,KJV,then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with
11559,GAL,2,KJV,me
11560,GAL,2,KJV,also
11561,GAL,2,KJV,and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain
11562,GAL,2,KJV,but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised
11563,GAL,2,KJV,and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage
11564,GAL,2,KJV,to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you
11565,GAL,2,KJV,but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who seemed
11566,GAL,2,KJV,to be somewhat
11567,GAL,2,KJV,in conference added nothing to me
11568,GAL,2,KJV,but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as
11569,GAL,2,KJV,the gospel
11570,GAL,2,KJV,of the circumcision
11571,GAL,2,KJV,was
11572,GAL,2,KJV,unto peter
11573,GAL,2,KJV,for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles
11574,GAL,2,KJV,and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we
11575,GAL,2,KJV,should go
11576,GAL,2,KJV,unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision
11577,GAL,2,KJV,only
11578,GAL,2,KJV,they would
11579,GAL,2,KJV,that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do
11580,GAL,2,KJV,but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed
11581,GAL,2,KJV,for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision
11582,GAL,2,KJV,and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
11583,GAL,2,KJV,but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before
11584,GAL,2,KJV,them
11585,GAL,2,KJV,all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews
11586,GAL,2,KJV,we
11587,GAL,2,KJV,who are
11588,GAL,2,KJV,jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles
11589,GAL,2,KJV,knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
11590,GAL,2,KJV,but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners
11591,GAL,2,KJV,is
11592,GAL,2,KJV,therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid
11593,GAL,2,KJV,for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor
11594,GAL,2,KJV,for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god
11595,GAL,2,KJV,i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
11596,GAL,2,KJV,i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness
11597,GAL,2,KJV,come
11598,GAL,2,KJV,by the law then christ is dead in vain
11599,GAL,3,KJV,o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you
11600,GAL,3,KJV,this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
11601,GAL,3,KJV,are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
11602,GAL,3,KJV,have ye suffered so many things in vain if
11603,GAL,3,KJV,it be
11604,GAL,3,KJV,yet in vain
11605,GAL,3,KJV,he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you
11606,GAL,3,KJV,doeth he it
11607,GAL,3,KJV,by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
11608,GAL,3,KJV,even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness
11609,GAL,3,KJV,know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham
11610,GAL,3,KJV,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham
11611,GAL,3,KJV,saying
11612,GAL,3,KJV,in thee shall all nations be blessed
11613,GAL,3,KJV,so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham
11614,GAL,3,KJV,for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed
11615,GAL,3,KJV,is
11616,GAL,3,KJV,every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them
11617,GAL,3,KJV,but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god
11618,GAL,3,KJV,it is
11619,GAL,3,KJV,evident for the just shall live by faith
11620,GAL,3,KJV,and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them
11621,GAL,3,KJV,christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed
11622,GAL,3,KJV,is
11623,GAL,3,KJV,every one that hangeth on a tree
11624,GAL,3,KJV,that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
11625,GAL,3,KJV,brethren i speak after the manner of men though
11626,GAL,3,KJV,it be
11627,GAL,3,KJV,but a mans covenant yet
11628,GAL,3,KJV,if it be
11629,GAL,3,KJV,confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto
11630,GAL,3,KJV,now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ
11631,GAL,3,KJV,and this i say
11632,GAL,3,KJV,that
11633,GAL,3,KJV,the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect
11634,GAL,3,KJV,for if the inheritance
11635,GAL,3,KJV,be
11636,GAL,3,KJV,of the law
11637,GAL,3,KJV,it is
11638,GAL,3,KJV,no more of promise but god gave
11639,GAL,3,KJV,it
11640,GAL,3,KJV,to abraham by promise
11641,GAL,3,KJV,wherefore then
11642,GAL,3,KJV,serveth
11643,GAL,3,KJV,the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made
11644,GAL,3,KJV,and it was
11645,GAL,3,KJV,ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator
11646,GAL,3,KJV,now a mediator is not
11647,GAL,3,KJV,a mediator
11648,GAL,3,KJV,of one but god is one
11649,GAL,3,KJV,is
11650,GAL,3,KJV,the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law
11651,GAL,3,KJV,but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
11652,GAL,3,KJV,but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed
11653,GAL,3,KJV,wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
11654,GAL,3,KJV,to bring us
11655,GAL,3,KJV,unto christ that we might be justified by faith
11656,GAL,3,KJV,but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster
11657,GAL,3,KJV,for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
11658,GAL,3,KJV,for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
11659,GAL,3,KJV,there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus
11660,GAL,3,KJV,and if ye
11661,GAL,3,KJV,be
11662,GAL,3,KJV,christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise
11663,GAL,4,KJV,now i say
11664,GAL,4,KJV,that
11665,GAL,4,KJV,the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all
11666,GAL,4,KJV,but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father
11667,GAL,4,KJV,even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world
11668,GAL,4,KJV,but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law
11669,GAL,4,KJV,to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons
11670,GAL,4,KJV,and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father
11671,GAL,4,KJV,wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ
11672,GAL,4,KJV,howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods
11673,GAL,4,KJV,but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage
11674,GAL,4,KJV,ye observe days and months and times and years
11675,GAL,4,KJV,i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain
11676,GAL,4,KJV,brethren i beseech you be as i
11677,GAL,4,KJV,am
11678,GAL,4,KJV,for i
11679,GAL,4,KJV,am
11680,GAL,4,KJV,as ye
11681,GAL,4,KJV,are
11682,GAL,4,KJV,ye have not injured me at all
11683,GAL,4,KJV,ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first
11684,GAL,4,KJV,and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god
11685,GAL,4,KJV,even
11686,GAL,4,KJV,as christ jesus
11687,GAL,4,KJV,where is then the blessedness ye spake of for i bear you record that if
11688,GAL,4,KJV,it had been
11689,GAL,4,KJV,possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me
11690,GAL,4,KJV,am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth
11691,GAL,4,KJV,they zealously affect you
11692,GAL,4,KJV,but
11693,GAL,4,KJV,not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them
11694,GAL,4,KJV,but
11695,GAL,4,KJV,it is
11696,GAL,4,KJV,good to be zealously affected always in
11697,GAL,4,KJV,good
11698,GAL,4,KJV,thing
11699,GAL,4,KJV,and not only when i am present with you
11700,GAL,4,KJV,my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you
11701,GAL,4,KJV,i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you
11702,GAL,4,KJV,tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law
11703,GAL,4,KJV,for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman
11704,GAL,4,KJV,but he
11705,GAL,4,KJV,who was
11706,GAL,4,KJV,of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman
11707,GAL,4,KJV,was
11708,GAL,4,KJV,by promise
11709,GAL,4,KJV,which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar
11710,GAL,4,KJV,for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children
11711,GAL,4,KJV,but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all
11712,GAL,4,KJV,for it is written
11713,GAL,4,KJV,rejoice thou barren that bearest not
11714,GAL,4,KJV,break forth and cry thou that travailest not
11715,GAL,4,KJV,for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband
11716,GAL,4,KJV,now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise
11717,GAL,4,KJV,but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
11718,GAL,4,KJV,that was born
11719,GAL,4,KJV,after the spirit even so
11720,GAL,4,KJV,it is
11721,GAL,4,KJV,now
11722,GAL,4,KJV,nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman
11723,GAL,4,KJV,so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free
11724,GAL,5,KJV,stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
11725,GAL,5,KJV,behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing
11726,GAL,5,KJV,for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law
11727,GAL,5,KJV,christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
11728,GAL,5,KJV,for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
11729,GAL,5,KJV,for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love
11730,GAL,5,KJV,ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth
11731,GAL,5,KJV,this persuasion
11732,GAL,5,KJV,cometh
11733,GAL,5,KJV,not of him that calleth you
11734,GAL,5,KJV,a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
11735,GAL,5,KJV,i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be
11736,GAL,5,KJV,and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceased
11737,GAL,5,KJV,i would they were even cut off which trouble you
11738,GAL,5,KJV,for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only
11739,GAL,5,KJV,use
11740,GAL,5,KJV,not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another
11741,GAL,5,KJV,for all the law is fulfilled in one word
11742,GAL,5,KJV,even
11743,GAL,5,KJV,in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
11744,GAL,5,KJV,but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another
11745,GAL,5,KJV,this
11746,GAL,5,KJV,i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh
11747,GAL,5,KJV,for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would
11748,GAL,5,KJV,but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law
11749,GAL,5,KJV,now the works of the flesh are manifest which are
11750,GAL,5,KJV,these
11751,GAL,5,KJV,adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
11752,GAL,5,KJV,idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies
11753,GAL,5,KJV,envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told
11754,GAL,5,KJV,you
11755,GAL,5,KJV,in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god
11756,GAL,5,KJV,but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith
11757,GAL,5,KJV,meekness temperance against such there is no law
11758,GAL,5,KJV,and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
11759,GAL,5,KJV,if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit
11760,GAL,5,KJV,let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another
11761,GAL,6,KJV,brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted
11762,GAL,6,KJV,bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ
11763,GAL,6,KJV,for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself
11764,GAL,6,KJV,but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another
11765,GAL,6,KJV,for every man shall bear his own burden
11766,GAL,6,KJV,let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things
11767,GAL,6,KJV,be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
11768,GAL,6,KJV,for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
11769,GAL,6,KJV,and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not
11770,GAL,6,KJV,as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all
11771,GAL,6,KJV,men
11772,GAL,6,KJV,especially unto them who are of the household of faith
11773,GAL,6,KJV,ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand
11774,GAL,6,KJV,as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ
11775,GAL,6,KJV,for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh
11776,GAL,6,KJV,but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world
11777,GAL,6,KJV,for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature
11778,GAL,6,KJV,and as many as walk according to this rule peace
11779,GAL,6,KJV,be
11780,GAL,6,KJV,on them and mercy and upon the israel of god
11781,GAL,6,KJV,from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus
11782,GAL,6,KJV,brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ
11783,GAL,6,KJV,be
11784,GAL,6,KJV,with your spirit amen
11785,GAL,6,KJV,unto the galatians written from rome
11786,EPH,1,KJV,paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus
11787,EPH,1,KJV,grace
11788,EPH,1,KJV,be
11789,EPH,1,KJV,to you and peace from god our father and
11790,EPH,1,KJV,from
11791,EPH,1,KJV,the lord jesus christ
11792,EPH,1,KJV,blessed
11793,EPH,1,KJV,be
11794,EPH,1,KJV,the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
11795,EPH,1,KJV,places
11796,EPH,1,KJV,in christ
11797,EPH,1,KJV,according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
11798,EPH,1,KJV,having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
11799,EPH,1,KJV,to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
11800,EPH,1,KJV,in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
11801,EPH,1,KJV,wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence
11802,EPH,1,KJV,having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself
11803,EPH,1,KJV,that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth
11804,EPH,1,KJV,even
11805,EPH,1,KJV,in him
11806,EPH,1,KJV,in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
11807,EPH,1,KJV,that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ
11808,EPH,1,KJV,in whom ye also
11809,EPH,1,KJV,trusted
11810,EPH,1,KJV,after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise
11811,EPH,1,KJV,which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory
11812,EPH,1,KJV,wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints
11813,EPH,1,KJV,cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers
11814,EPH,1,KJV,that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
11815,EPH,1,KJV,the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
11816,EPH,1,KJV,and what
11817,EPH,1,KJV,is
11818,EPH,1,KJV,the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power
11819,EPH,1,KJV,which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set
11820,EPH,1,KJV,him
11821,EPH,1,KJV,at his own right hand in the heavenly
11822,EPH,1,KJV,places
11823,EPH,1,KJV,
11824,EPH,1,KJV,far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come
11825,EPH,1,KJV,and hath put all
11826,EPH,1,KJV,things
11827,EPH,1,KJV,under his feet and gave him
11828,EPH,1,KJV,to be
11829,EPH,1,KJV,the head over all
11830,EPH,1,KJV,things
11831,EPH,1,KJV,to the church
11832,EPH,1,KJV,which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all
11833,EPH,2,KJV,and you
11834,EPH,2,KJV,hath he quickened
11835,EPH,2,KJV,who were dead in trespasses and sins
11836,EPH,2,KJV,wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
11837,EPH,2,KJV,among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others
11838,EPH,2,KJV,but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us
11839,EPH,2,KJV,even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved
11840,EPH,2,KJV,and hath raised
11841,EPH,2,KJV,us
11842,EPH,2,KJV,up together and made
11843,EPH,2,KJV,us
11844,EPH,2,KJV,sit together in heavenly
11845,EPH,2,KJV,places
11846,EPH,2,KJV,in christ jesus
11847,EPH,2,KJV,that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in
11848,EPH,2,KJV,his
11849,EPH,2,KJV,kindness toward us through christ jesus
11850,EPH,2,KJV,for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves
11851,EPH,2,KJV,it is
11852,EPH,2,KJV,the gift of god
11853,EPH,2,KJV,not of works lest any man should boast
11854,EPH,2,KJV,for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
11855,EPH,2,KJV,wherefore remember that ye
11856,EPH,2,KJV,being
11857,EPH,2,KJV,in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands
11858,EPH,2,KJV,that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world
11859,EPH,2,KJV,but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ
11860,EPH,2,KJV,for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
11861,EPH,2,KJV,between us
11862,EPH,2,KJV,
11863,EPH,2,KJV,having abolished in his flesh the enmity
11864,EPH,2,KJV,even
11865,EPH,2,KJV,the law of commandments
11866,EPH,2,KJV,contained
11867,EPH,2,KJV,in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man
11868,EPH,2,KJV,so
11869,EPH,2,KJV,making peace
11870,EPH,2,KJV,and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby
11871,EPH,2,KJV,and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh
11872,EPH,2,KJV,for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father
11873,EPH,2,KJV,now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god
11874,EPH,2,KJV,and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner
11875,EPH,2,KJV,stone
11876,EPH,2,KJV,
11877,EPH,2,KJV,in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord
11878,EPH,2,KJV,in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit
11879,EPH,3,KJV,for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles
11880,EPH,3,KJV,if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward
11881,EPH,3,KJV,how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words
11882,EPH,3,KJV,whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ
11883,EPH,3,KJV,which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
11884,EPH,3,KJV,that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel
11885,EPH,3,KJV,whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power
11886,EPH,3,KJV,unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ
11887,EPH,3,KJV,and to make all
11888,EPH,3,KJV,men
11889,EPH,3,KJV,see what
11890,EPH,3,KJV,is
11891,EPH,3,KJV,the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ
11892,EPH,3,KJV,to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
11893,EPH,3,KJV,places
11894,EPH,3,KJV,might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god
11895,EPH,3,KJV,according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord
11896,EPH,3,KJV,in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him
11897,EPH,3,KJV,wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory
11898,EPH,3,KJV,for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ
11899,EPH,3,KJV,of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named
11900,EPH,3,KJV,that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man
11901,EPH,3,KJV,that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love
11902,EPH,3,KJV,may be able to comprehend with all saints what
11903,EPH,3,KJV,is
11904,EPH,3,KJV,the breadth and length and depth and height
11905,EPH,3,KJV,and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god
11906,EPH,3,KJV,now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us
11907,EPH,3,KJV,unto him
11908,EPH,3,KJV,be
11909,EPH,3,KJV,glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen
11910,EPH,4,KJV,i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called
11911,EPH,4,KJV,with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love
11912,EPH,4,KJV,endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
11913,EPH,4,KJV,there is
11914,EPH,4,KJV,one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling
11915,EPH,4,KJV,one lord one faith one baptism
11916,EPH,4,KJV,one god and father of all who
11917,EPH,4,KJV,is
11918,EPH,4,KJV,above all and through all and in you all
11919,EPH,4,KJV,but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ
11920,EPH,4,KJV,wherefore he saith
11921,EPH,4,KJV,when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive
11922,EPH,4,KJV,and gave gifts unto men
11923,EPH,4,KJV,now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth
11924,EPH,4,KJV,he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things
11925,EPH,4,KJV,and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers
11926,EPH,4,KJV,for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ
11927,EPH,4,KJV,till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ
11928,EPH,4,KJV,that we
11929,EPH,4,KJV,henceforth
11930,EPH,4,KJV,be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
11931,EPH,4,KJV,and
11932,EPH,4,KJV,cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive
11933,EPH,4,KJV,but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head
11934,EPH,4,KJV,even
11935,EPH,4,KJV,christ
11936,EPH,4,KJV,from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love
11937,EPH,4,KJV,this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind
11938,EPH,4,KJV,having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart
11939,EPH,4,KJV,who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness
11940,EPH,4,KJV,but ye have not so learned christ
11941,EPH,4,KJV,if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus
11942,EPH,4,KJV,that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
11943,EPH,4,KJV,and be renewed in the spirit of your mind
11944,EPH,4,KJV,and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness
11945,EPH,4,KJV,wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another
11946,EPH,4,KJV,be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath
11947,EPH,4,KJV,neither give place to the devil
11948,EPH,4,KJV,let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with
11949,EPH,4,KJV,his
11950,EPH,4,KJV,hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth
11951,EPH,4,KJV,let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers
11952,EPH,4,KJV,and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
11953,EPH,4,KJV,let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice
11954,EPH,4,KJV,and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you
11955,EPH,5,KJV,be ye therefore followers of god as dear children
11956,EPH,5,KJV,and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
11957,EPH,5,KJV,but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints
11958,EPH,5,KJV,neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks
11959,EPH,5,KJV,for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
11960,EPH,5,KJV,let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience
11961,EPH,5,KJV,be not ye therefore partakers with them
11962,EPH,5,KJV,for ye were sometimes darkness but now
11963,EPH,5,KJV,are ye
11964,EPH,5,KJV,light in the lord walk as children of light
11965,EPH,5,KJV,for the fruit of the spirit
11966,EPH,5,KJV,is
11967,EPH,5,KJV,in all goodness and righteousness and truth
11968,EPH,5,KJV,proving what is acceptable unto the lord
11969,EPH,5,KJV,and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove
11970,EPH,5,KJV,them
11971,EPH,5,KJV,
11972,EPH,5,KJV,for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret
11973,EPH,5,KJV,but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light
11974,EPH,5,KJV,wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light
11975,EPH,5,KJV,see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise
11976,EPH,5,KJV,redeeming the time because the days are evil
11977,EPH,5,KJV,wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord
11978,EPH,5,KJV,is
11979,EPH,5,KJV,
11980,EPH,5,KJV,and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit
11981,EPH,5,KJV,speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord
11982,EPH,5,KJV,giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ
11983,EPH,5,KJV,submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god
11984,EPH,5,KJV,wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord
11985,EPH,5,KJV,for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body
11986,EPH,5,KJV,therefore as the church is subject unto christ so
11987,EPH,5,KJV,let
11988,EPH,5,KJV,the wives
11989,EPH,5,KJV,be
11990,EPH,5,KJV,to their own husbands in every thing
11991,EPH,5,KJV,husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it
11992,EPH,5,KJV,that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word
11993,EPH,5,KJV,that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish
11994,EPH,5,KJV,so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself
11995,EPH,5,KJV,for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church
11996,EPH,5,KJV,for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones
11997,EPH,5,KJV,for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh
11998,EPH,5,KJV,this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church
11999,EPH,5,KJV,nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife
12000,EPH,5,KJV,see
12001,EPH,5,KJV,that she reverence
12002,EPH,5,KJV,her
12003,EPH,5,KJV,husband
12004,EPH,6,KJV,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right
12005,EPH,6,KJV,honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise
12006,EPH,6,KJV,that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth
12007,EPH,6,KJV,and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord
12008,EPH,6,KJV,servants be obedient to them that are
12009,EPH,6,KJV,your
12010,EPH,6,KJV,masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ
12011,EPH,6,KJV,not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart
12012,EPH,6,KJV,with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men
12013,EPH,6,KJV,knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether
12014,EPH,6,KJV,he be
12015,EPH,6,KJV,bond or free
12016,EPH,6,KJV,and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him
12017,EPH,6,KJV,finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
12018,EPH,6,KJV,put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
12019,EPH,6,KJV,for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high
12020,EPH,6,KJV,places
12021,EPH,6,KJV,
12022,EPH,6,KJV,wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
12023,EPH,6,KJV,stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness
12024,EPH,6,KJV,and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace
12025,EPH,6,KJV,above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
12026,EPH,6,KJV,and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
12027,EPH,6,KJV,praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints
12028,EPH,6,KJV,and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel
12029,EPH,6,KJV,for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak
12030,EPH,6,KJV,but that ye also may know my affairs
12031,EPH,6,KJV,and
12032,EPH,6,KJV,how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things
12033,EPH,6,KJV,whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and
12034,EPH,6,KJV,that
12035,EPH,6,KJV,he might comfort your hearts
12036,EPH,6,KJV,peace
12037,EPH,6,KJV,be
12038,EPH,6,KJV,to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
12039,EPH,6,KJV,grace
12040,EPH,6,KJV,be
12041,EPH,6,KJV,with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity amen
12042,EPH,6,KJV,written from rome unto the ephesians by tychicus
12043,PHP,1,KJV,paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons
12044,PHP,1,KJV,grace
12045,PHP,1,KJV,be
12046,PHP,1,KJV,unto you and peace from god our father and
12047,PHP,1,KJV,from
12048,PHP,1,KJV,the lord jesus christ
12049,PHP,1,KJV,i thank my god upon every remembrance of you
12050,PHP,1,KJV,always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy
12051,PHP,1,KJV,for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now
12052,PHP,1,KJV,being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform
12053,PHP,1,KJV,it
12054,PHP,1,KJV,until the day of jesus christ
12055,PHP,1,KJV,even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace
12056,PHP,1,KJV,for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ
12057,PHP,1,KJV,and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and
12058,PHP,1,KJV,in
12059,PHP,1,KJV,all judgment
12060,PHP,1,KJV,that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ
12061,PHP,1,KJV,being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god
12062,PHP,1,KJV,but i would ye should understand brethren that the things
12063,PHP,1,KJV,which happened
12064,PHP,1,KJV,unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel
12065,PHP,1,KJV,so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other
12066,PHP,1,KJV,places
12067,PHP,1,KJV,
12068,PHP,1,KJV,and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear
12069,PHP,1,KJV,some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will
12070,PHP,1,KJV,the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds
12071,PHP,1,KJV,but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel
12072,PHP,1,KJV,what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice
12073,PHP,1,KJV,for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ
12074,PHP,1,KJV,according to my earnest expectation and
12075,PHP,1,KJV,my
12076,PHP,1,KJV,hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but
12077,PHP,1,KJV,that
12078,PHP,1,KJV,with all boldness as always
12079,PHP,1,KJV,so
12080,PHP,1,KJV,now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether
12081,PHP,1,KJV,it be
12082,PHP,1,KJV,by life or by death
12083,PHP,1,KJV,for to me to live
12084,PHP,1,KJV,is
12085,PHP,1,KJV,christ and to die
12086,PHP,1,KJV,is
12087,PHP,1,KJV,gain
12088,PHP,1,KJV,but if i live in the flesh this
12089,PHP,1,KJV,is
12090,PHP,1,KJV,the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not
12091,PHP,1,KJV,for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better
12092,PHP,1,KJV,nevertheless to abide in the flesh
12093,PHP,1,KJV,is
12094,PHP,1,KJV,more needful for you
12095,PHP,1,KJV,and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith
12096,PHP,1,KJV,that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again
12097,PHP,1,KJV,only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel
12098,PHP,1,KJV,and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god
12099,PHP,1,KJV,for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake
12100,PHP,1,KJV,having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear
12101,PHP,1,KJV,to be
12102,PHP,1,KJV,in me
12103,PHP,2,KJV,if
12104,PHP,2,KJV,there be
12105,PHP,2,KJV,therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies
12106,PHP,2,KJV,fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love
12107,PHP,2,KJV,being
12108,PHP,2,KJV,of one accord of one mind
12109,PHP,2,KJV,let
12110,PHP,2,KJV,nothing
12111,PHP,2,KJV,be done
12112,PHP,2,KJV,through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves
12113,PHP,2,KJV,look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others
12114,PHP,2,KJV,let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
12115,PHP,2,KJV,who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god
12116,PHP,2,KJV,but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men
12117,PHP,2,KJV,and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
12118,PHP,2,KJV,wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name
12119,PHP,2,KJV,that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of
12120,PHP,2,KJV,things
12121,PHP,2,KJV,in heaven and
12122,PHP,2,KJV,things
12123,PHP,2,KJV,in earth and
12124,PHP,2,KJV,things
12125,PHP,2,KJV,under the earth
12126,PHP,2,KJV,and
12127,PHP,2,KJV,that
12128,PHP,2,KJV,every tongue should confess that jesus christ
12129,PHP,2,KJV,is
12130,PHP,2,KJV,lord to the glory of god the father
12131,PHP,2,KJV,wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
12132,PHP,2,KJV,for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of
12133,PHP,2,KJV,his
12134,PHP,2,KJV,good pleasure
12135,PHP,2,KJV,do all things without murmurings and disputings
12136,PHP,2,KJV,that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world
12137,PHP,2,KJV,holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain
12138,PHP,2,KJV,yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all
12139,PHP,2,KJV,for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me
12140,PHP,2,KJV,but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state
12141,PHP,2,KJV,for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state
12142,PHP,2,KJV,for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christs
12143,PHP,2,KJV,but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served with me in the gospel
12144,PHP,2,KJV,him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me
12145,PHP,2,KJV,but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly
12146,PHP,2,KJV,yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants
12147,PHP,2,KJV,for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick
12148,PHP,2,KJV,for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow
12149,PHP,2,KJV,i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful
12150,PHP,2,KJV,receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation
12151,PHP,2,KJV,because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me
12152,PHP,3,KJV,finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed
12153,PHP,3,KJV,is
12154,PHP,3,KJV,not grievous but for you
12155,PHP,3,KJV,it is
12156,PHP,3,KJV,safe
12157,PHP,3,KJV,beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision
12158,PHP,3,KJV,for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
12159,PHP,3,KJV,though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more
12160,PHP,3,KJV,circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel
12161,PHP,3,KJV,of
12162,PHP,3,KJV,the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee
12163,PHP,3,KJV,concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless
12164,PHP,3,KJV,but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ
12165,PHP,3,KJV,yea doubtless and i count all things
12166,PHP,3,KJV,but
12167,PHP,3,KJV,loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them
12168,PHP,3,KJV,but
12169,PHP,3,KJV,dung that i may win christ
12170,PHP,3,KJV,and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
12171,PHP,3,KJV,that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death
12172,PHP,3,KJV,if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead

12178,PHP,3,KJV,forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before
12179,PHP,3,KJV,i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
12180,PHP,3,KJV,let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you

12185,PHP,3,KJV,the enemies of the cross of christ
12186,PHP,3,KJV,whose end
12187,PHP,3,KJV,is
12188,PHP,3,KJV,destruction whose god

12237,PHP,4,KJV,now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only
12238,PHP,4,KJV,for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity

12284,COL,1,KJV,the forgiveness of sins
12285,COL,1,KJV,who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature
12286,COL,1,KJV,for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether

12295,COL,1,KJV,i say
12296,COL,1,KJV,whether
12297,COL,1,KJV,they be
12298,COL,1,KJV,things in earth or things in heaven
12299,COL,1,KJV,and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in

12305,COL,1,KJV,not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard
12306,COL,1,KJV,and
12307,COL,1,KJV,which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister
12308,COL,1,KJV,who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which is the church
12309,COL,1,KJV,whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of god
12310,COL,1,KJV,even
12311,COL,1,KJV,the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints
12312,COL,1,KJV,to whom god would make known what
12313,COL,1,KJV,is
12314,COL,1,KJV,the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory
12315,COL,1,KJV,whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus
12316,COL,1,KJV,whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily
12317,COL,2,KJV,for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and
12318,COL,2,KJV,for
12319,COL,2,KJV,them at laodicea and
12320,COL,2,KJV,for
12321,COL,2,KJV,as many as have not seen my face in the flesh
12322,COL,2,KJV,that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ
12323,COL,2,KJV,in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
12324,COL,2,KJV,and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
12325,COL,2,KJV,for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ
12326,COL,2,KJV,as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord
12327,COL,2,KJV,so
12328,COL,2,KJV,walk ye in him
12329,COL,2,KJV,rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving
12330,COL,2,KJV,beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ
12331,COL,2,KJV,for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily
12332,COL,2,KJV,and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power
12333,COL,2,KJV,in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ
12334,COL,2,KJV,buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with
12335,COL,2,KJV,him
12336,COL,2,KJV,through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead
12337,COL,2,KJV,and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses
12338,COL,2,KJV,blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross
12339,COL,2,KJV,and
12340,COL,2,KJV,having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it
12341,COL,2,KJV,let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath
12342,COL,2,KJV,days
12343,COL,2,KJV,
12344,COL,2,KJV,which are a shadow of things to come but the body
12345,COL,2,KJV,is
12346,COL,2,KJV,of christ
12347,COL,2,KJV,let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
12348,COL,2,KJV,and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god
12349,COL,2,KJV,wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances
12350,COL,2,KJV,touch not taste not handle not
12351,COL,2,KJV,which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men
12352,COL,2,KJV,which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh
12353,COL,3,KJV,if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god
12354,COL,3,KJV,set your affection on things above not on things on the earth
12355,COL,3,KJV,for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god
12356,COL,3,KJV,when christ
12357,COL,3,KJV,who is
12358,COL,3,KJV,our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory
12359,COL,3,KJV,mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry
12360,COL,3,KJV,for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience
12361,COL,3,KJV,in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them
12362,COL,3,KJV,but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth
12363,COL,3,KJV,lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds
12364,COL,3,KJV,and have put on the new
12365,COL,3,KJV,man
12366,COL,3,KJV,which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
12367,COL,3,KJV,where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond
12368,COL,3,KJV,nor
12369,COL,3,KJV,free but christ
12370,COL,3,KJV,is
12371,COL,3,KJV,all and in all
12372,COL,3,KJV,put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering
12373,COL,3,KJV,forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also
12374,COL,3,KJV,do
12375,COL,3,KJV,ye
12376,COL,3,KJV,and above all these things
12377,COL,3,KJV,put on
12378,COL,3,KJV,charity which is the bond of perfectness
12379,COL,3,KJV,and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful
12380,COL,3,KJV,let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord

12400,COL,3,KJV,knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ

12448,1TH,1,KJV,we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers
12449,1TH,1,KJV,remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father
12450,1TH,1,KJV,knowing brethren beloved your election of god
12451,1TH,1,KJV,for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake
12452,1TH,1,KJV,and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost
12453,1TH,1,KJV,so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia
12454,1TH,1,KJV,for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to godward is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing
12455,1TH,1,KJV,for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god
12456,1TH,1,KJV,and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead
12457,1TH,1,KJV,even
12458,1TH,1,KJV,jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come
12459,1TH,2,KJV,for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain
12460,1TH,2,KJV,but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention
12461,1TH,2,KJV,for our exhortation
12462,1TH,2,KJV,was
12463,1TH,2,KJV,not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile
12464,1TH,2,KJV,but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which trieth our hearts
12465,1TH,2,KJV,for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness god
12466,1TH,2,KJV,is
12467,1TH,2,KJV,witness
12468,1TH,2,KJV,nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor
12469,1TH,2,KJV,yet
12470,1TH,2,KJV,of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ
12471,1TH,2,KJV,but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children
12472,1TH,2,KJV,so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also our own souls because ye were dear unto us
12473,1TH,2,KJV,for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god
12474,1TH,2,KJV,ye
12475,1TH,2,KJV,are
12476,1TH,2,KJV,witnesses and god
12477,1TH,2,KJV,also
12478,1TH,2,KJV,how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe
12479,1TH,2,KJV,as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father
12480,1TH,2,KJV,doth
12481,1TH,2,KJV,his children
12482,1TH,2,KJV,that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
12483,1TH,2,KJV,for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received
12484,1TH,2,KJV,it
12485,1TH,2,KJV,not
12486,1TH,2,KJV,as
12487,1TH,2,KJV,the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe
12488,1TH,2,KJV,for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they
12489,1TH,2,KJV,have
12490,1TH,2,KJV,of the jews
12491,1TH,2,KJV,who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not god and are contrary to all men
12492,1TH,2,KJV,forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost
12493,1TH,2,KJV,but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire
12494,1TH,2,KJV,wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again but satan hindered us
12495,1TH,2,KJV,for what
12496,1TH,2,KJV,is
12497,1TH,2,KJV,our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing
12498,1TH,2,KJV,are
12499,1TH,2,KJV,not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming
12500,1TH,2,KJV,for ye are our glory and joy
12501,1TH,3,KJV,wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone
12502,1TH,3,KJV,and sent timotheus our brother and minister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith
12503,1TH,3,KJV,that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto
12504,1TH,3,KJV,for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know
12505,1TH,3,KJV,for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in vain
12506,1TH,3,KJV,but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also
12507,1TH,3,KJV,to see
12508,1TH,3,KJV,you
12509,1TH,3,KJV,therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith
12510,1TH,3,KJV,for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord
12511,1TH,3,KJV,for what thanks can we render to god again for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god
12512,1TH,3,KJV,night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith
12513,1TH,3,KJV,now god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you
12514,1TH,3,KJV,and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all
12515,1TH,3,KJV,men
12516,1TH,3,KJV,even as we
12517,1TH,3,KJV,do
12518,1TH,3,KJV,toward you
12519,1TH,3,KJV,to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
12520,1TH,4,KJV,furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort
12521,1TH,4,KJV,you
12522,1TH,4,KJV,by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god
12523,1TH,4,KJV,so
12524,1TH,4,KJV,ye would abound more and more
12525,1TH,4,KJV,for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus
12526,1TH,4,KJV,for this is the will of god
12527,1TH,4,KJV,even
12528,1TH,4,KJV,your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication
12529,1TH,4,KJV,that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour
12530,1TH,4,KJV,not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god
12531,1TH,4,KJV,that no
12532,1TH,4,KJV,man
12533,1TH,4,KJV,go beyond and defraud his brother in
12534,1TH,4,KJV,any
12535,1TH,4,KJV,matter because that the lord
12536,1TH,4,KJV,is
12537,1TH,4,KJV,the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified
12538,1TH,4,KJV,for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness
12539,1TH,4,KJV,he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath also given unto us his holy spirit
12540,1TH,4,KJV,but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another
12541,1TH,4,KJV,and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more
12542,1TH,4,KJV,and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you
12543,1TH,4,KJV,that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and
12544,1TH,4,KJV,that
12545,1TH,4,KJV,ye may have lack of nothing
12546,1TH,4,KJV,but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope
12547,1TH,4,KJV,for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him
12548,1TH,4,KJV,for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive
12549,1TH,4,KJV,and
12550,1TH,4,KJV,remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep
12551,1TH,4,KJV,for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first
12552,1TH,4,KJV,then we which are alive
12553,1TH,4,KJV,and
12554,1TH,4,KJV,remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
12555,1TH,4,KJV,wherefore comfort one another with these words
12556,1TH,5,KJV,but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you
12557,1TH,5,KJV,for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night
12558,1TH,5,KJV,for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape
12559,1TH,5,KJV,but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief
12560,1TH,5,KJV,ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness
12561,1TH,5,KJV,therefore let us not sleep as
12562,1TH,5,KJV,do
12563,1TH,5,KJV,others but let us watch and be sober
12564,1TH,5,KJV,for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night
12565,1TH,5,KJV,but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation
12566,1TH,5,KJV,for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ
12567,1TH,5,KJV,who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him
12568,1TH,5,KJV,wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do
12569,1TH,5,KJV,and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you
12570,1TH,5,KJV,and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake
12571,1TH,5,KJV,and
12572,1TH,5,KJV,be at peace among yourselves
12573,1TH,5,KJV,now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all
12574,1TH,5,KJV,men
12575,1TH,5,KJV,
12576,1TH,5,KJV,see that none render evil for evil unto any
12577,1TH,5,KJV,man
12578,1TH,5,KJV,but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all
12579,1TH,5,KJV,men
12580,1TH,5,KJV,
12581,1TH,5,KJV,rejoice evermore
12582,1TH,5,KJV,pray without ceasing
12583,1TH,5,KJV,in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you
12584,1TH,5,KJV,quench not the spirit
12585,1TH,5,KJV,despise not prophesyings
12586,1TH,5,KJV,prove all things hold fast that which is good
12587,1TH,5,KJV,abstain from all appearance of evil
12588,1TH,5,KJV,and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and
12589,1TH,5,KJV,i pray god
12590,1TH,5,KJV,your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
12591,1TH,5,KJV,faithful
12592,1TH,5,KJV,is
12593,1TH,5,KJV,he that calleth you who also will do
12594,1TH,5,KJV,it
12595,1TH,5,KJV,brethren pray for us
12596,1TH,5,KJV,greet all the brethren with an holy kiss
12597,1TH,5,KJV,i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren
12598,1TH,5,KJV,the grace of our lord jesus christ
12599,1TH,5,KJV,be
12600,1TH,5,KJV,with you amen
12601,1TH,5,KJV,the first epistle unto the thessalonians was written from athens
12602,2TH,1,KJV,paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
12603,2TH,1,KJV,grace unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
12604,2TH,1,KJV,we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth
12605,2TH,1,KJV,so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure
12606,2TH,1,KJV,which is
12607,2TH,1,KJV,a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer
12608,2TH,1,KJV,seeing
12609,2TH,1,KJV,it is
12610,2TH,1,KJV,a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you
12611,2TH,1,KJV,and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
12612,2TH,1,KJV,in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
12613,2TH,1,KJV,who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power
12614,2TH,1,KJV,when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day
12615,2TH,1,KJV,wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of
12616,2TH,1,KJV,this
12617,2TH,1,KJV,calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of
12618,2TH,1,KJV,his
12619,2TH,1,KJV,goodness and the work of faith with power
12620,2TH,1,KJV,that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
12621,2TH,2,KJV,now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and
12622,2TH,2,KJV,by
12623,2TH,2,KJV,our gathering together unto him
12624,2TH,2,KJV,that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand
12625,2TH,2,KJV,let no man deceive you by any means for
12626,2TH,2,KJV,that day shall not come
12627,2TH,2,KJV,except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition
12628,2TH,2,KJV,who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god
12629,2TH,2,KJV,remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things
12630,2TH,2,KJV,and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time
12631,2TH,2,KJV,for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth
12632,2TH,2,KJV,will let
12633,2TH,2,KJV,until he be taken out of the way
12634,2TH,2,KJV,and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming
12635,2TH,2,KJV,even him
12636,2TH,2,KJV,whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders
12637,2TH,2,KJV,and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved
12638,2TH,2,KJV,and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie
12639,2TH,2,KJV,that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
12640,2TH,2,KJV,but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth
12641,2TH,2,KJV,whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ
12642,2TH,2,KJV,therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle
12643,2TH,2,KJV,now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given
12644,2TH,2,KJV,us
12645,2TH,2,KJV,everlasting consolation and good hope through grace
12646,2TH,2,KJV,comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work
12647,2TH,3,KJV,finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have
12648,2TH,3,KJV,free
12649,2TH,3,KJV,course and be glorified even as
12650,2TH,3,KJV,it is
12651,2TH,3,KJV,with you
12652,2TH,3,KJV,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all
12653,2TH,3,KJV,men
12654,2TH,3,KJV,have not faith
12655,2TH,3,KJV,but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep
12656,2TH,3,KJV,you
12657,2TH,3,KJV,from evil
12658,2TH,3,KJV,and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you
12659,2TH,3,KJV,and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ
12660,2TH,3,KJV,now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us
12661,2TH,3,KJV,for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you
12662,2TH,3,KJV,neither did we eat any mans bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you
12663,2TH,3,KJV,not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us
12664,2TH,3,KJV,for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat
12665,2TH,3,KJV,for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies
12666,2TH,3,KJV,now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread
12667,2TH,3,KJV,but ye brethren be not weary in well doing
12668,2TH,3,KJV,and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed
12669,2TH,3,KJV,yet count
12670,2TH,3,KJV,him
12671,2TH,3,KJV,not as an enemy but admonish
12672,2TH,3,KJV,him
12673,2TH,3,KJV,as a brother
12674,2TH,3,KJV,now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means the lord
12675,2TH,3,KJV,be
12676,2TH,3,KJV,with you all
12677,2TH,3,KJV,the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write
12678,2TH,3,KJV,the grace of our lord jesus christ
12679,2TH,3,KJV,be
12680,2TH,3,KJV,with you all amen
12681,2TH,3,KJV,the second epistle to the thessalonians was written from athens
12682,1TI,1,KJV,paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ
12683,1TI,1,KJV,which is
12684,1TI,1,KJV,our hope
12685,1TI,1,KJV,unto timothy
12686,1TI,1,KJV,my
12687,1TI,1,KJV,own son in the faith grace mercy
12688,1TI,1,KJV,and
12689,1TI,1,KJV,peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord
12690,1TI,1,KJV,as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine
12691,1TI,1,KJV,neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith
12692,1TI,1,KJV,so do
12693,1TI,1,KJV,
12694,1TI,1,KJV,now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and
12695,1TI,1,KJV,of
12696,1TI,1,KJV,a good conscience and
12697,1TI,1,KJV,of
12698,1TI,1,KJV,faith unfeigned
12699,1TI,1,KJV,from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling
12700,1TI,1,KJV,desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm
12701,1TI,1,KJV,but we know that the law
12702,1TI,1,KJV,is
12703,1TI,1,KJV,good if a man use it lawfully
12704,1TI,1,KJV,knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers
12705,1TI,1,KJV,for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
12706,1TI,1,KJV,according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was committed to my trust
12707,1TI,1,KJV,and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry
12708,1TI,1,KJV,who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did
12709,1TI,1,KJV,it
12710,1TI,1,KJV,ignorantly in unbelief
12711,1TI,1,KJV,and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus
12712,1TI,1,KJV,this
12713,1TI,1,KJV,is
12714,1TI,1,KJV,a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
12715,1TI,1,KJV,howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting
12716,1TI,1,KJV,now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god
12717,1TI,1,KJV,be
12718,1TI,1,KJV,honour and glory for ever and ever amen
12719,1TI,1,KJV,this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a good warfare
12720,1TI,1,KJV,holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck
12721,1TI,1,KJV,of whom is hymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme
12722,1TI,2,KJV,i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions
12723,1TI,2,KJV,and
12724,1TI,2,KJV,giving of thanks be made for all men
12725,1TI,2,KJV,for kings and
12726,1TI,2,KJV,for
12727,1TI,2,KJV,all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
12728,1TI,2,KJV,for this
12729,1TI,2,KJV,is
12730,1TI,2,KJV,good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour
12731,1TI,2,KJV,who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
12732,1TI,2,KJV,for
12733,1TI,2,KJV,there is
12734,1TI,2,KJV,one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
12735,1TI,2,KJV,who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time
12736,1TI,2,KJV,whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ
12737,1TI,2,KJV,and
12738,1TI,2,KJV,lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity
12739,1TI,2,KJV,i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting
12740,1TI,2,KJV,in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array
12741,1TI,2,KJV,but which becometh women professing godliness with good works
12742,1TI,2,KJV,let the woman learn in silence with all subjection
12743,1TI,2,KJV,but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
12744,1TI,2,KJV,for adam was first formed then eve
12745,1TI,2,KJV,and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
12746,1TI,2,KJV,notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety
12747,1TI,3,KJV,this
12748,1TI,3,KJV,is
12749,1TI,3,KJV,a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work
12750,1TI,3,KJV,a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teach
12751,1TI,3,KJV,not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetous
12752,1TI,3,KJV,one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity
12753,1TI,3,KJV,for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god
12754,1TI,3,KJV,not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
12755,1TI,3,KJV,moreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil
12756,1TI,3,KJV,likewise
12757,1TI,3,KJV,must
12758,1TI,3,KJV,the deacons
12759,1TI,3,KJV,be
12760,1TI,3,KJV,grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre
12761,1TI,3,KJV,holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
12762,1TI,3,KJV,and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being
12763,1TI,3,KJV,found
12764,1TI,3,KJV,blameless
12765,1TI,3,KJV,even so
12766,1TI,3,KJV,must their
12767,1TI,3,KJV,wives
12768,1TI,3,KJV,be
12769,1TI,3,KJV,grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things
12770,1TI,3,KJV,let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well
12771,1TI,3,KJV,for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus
12772,1TI,3,KJV,these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly
12773,1TI,3,KJV,but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth
12774,1TI,3,KJV,and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory
12775,1TI,4,KJV,now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
12776,1TI,4,KJV,speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron
12777,1TI,4,KJV,forbidding to marry
12778,1TI,4,KJV,and commanding
12779,1TI,4,KJV,to abstain from meats which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth
12780,1TI,4,KJV,for every creature of god
12781,1TI,4,KJV,is
12782,1TI,4,KJV,good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving
12783,1TI,4,KJV,for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer
12784,1TI,4,KJV,if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained
12785,1TI,4,KJV,but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself
12786,1TI,4,KJV,rather
12787,1TI,4,KJV,unto godliness
12788,1TI,4,KJV,for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come
12789,1TI,4,KJV,this
12790,1TI,4,KJV,is
12791,1TI,4,KJV,a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation
12792,1TI,4,KJV,for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe
12793,1TI,4,KJV,these things command and teach
12794,1TI,4,KJV,let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity
12795,1TI,4,KJV,till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine
12796,1TI,4,KJV,neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery
12797,1TI,4,KJV,meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to all
12798,1TI,4,KJV,take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee
12799,1TI,5,KJV,rebuke not an elder but intreat
12800,1TI,5,KJV,him
12801,1TI,5,KJV,as a father
12802,1TI,5,KJV,and
12803,1TI,5,KJV,the younger men as brethren
12804,1TI,5,KJV,the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity
12805,1TI,5,KJV,honour widows that are widows indeed
12806,1TI,5,KJV,but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before god
12807,1TI,5,KJV,now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day
12808,1TI,5,KJV,but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
12809,1TI,5,KJV,and these things give in charge that they may be blameless
12810,1TI,5,KJV,but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel
12811,1TI,5,KJV,let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man
12812,1TI,5,KJV,well reported of for good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good work
12813,1TI,5,KJV,but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry
12814,1TI,5,KJV,having damnation because they have cast off their first faith
12815,1TI,5,KJV,and withal they learn
12816,1TI,5,KJV,to be
12817,1TI,5,KJV,idle wandering about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought not
12818,1TI,5,KJV,i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully
12819,1TI,5,KJV,for some are already turned aside after satan
12820,1TI,5,KJV,if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed
12821,1TI,5,KJV,let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
12822,1TI,5,KJV,for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labourer
12823,1TI,5,KJV,is
12824,1TI,5,KJV,worthy of his reward
12825,1TI,5,KJV,against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses
12826,1TI,5,KJV,them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear
12827,1TI,5,KJV,i charge
12828,1TI,5,KJV,thee
12829,1TI,5,KJV,before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality
12830,1TI,5,KJV,lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins keep thyself pure
12831,1TI,5,KJV,drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities
12832,1TI,5,KJV,some mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some
12833,1TI,5,KJV,men
12834,1TI,5,KJV,they follow after
12835,1TI,5,KJV,likewise also the good works
12836,1TI,5,KJV,of some
12837,1TI,5,KJV,are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid
12838,1TI,6,KJV,let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour that the name of god and
12839,1TI,6,KJV,his
12840,1TI,6,KJV,doctrine be not blasphemed
12841,1TI,6,KJV,and they that have believing masters let them not despise
12842,1TI,6,KJV,them
12843,1TI,6,KJV,because they are brethren but rather do
12844,1TI,6,KJV,them
12845,1TI,6,KJV,service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort
12846,1TI,6,KJV,if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words
12847,1TI,6,KJV,even
12848,1TI,6,KJV,the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness
12849,1TI,6,KJV,he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings
12850,1TI,6,KJV,perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself
12851,1TI,6,KJV,but godliness with contentment is great gain
12852,1TI,6,KJV,for we brought nothing into
12853,1TI,6,KJV,this
12854,1TI,6,KJV,world
12855,1TI,6,KJV,and it is
12856,1TI,6,KJV,certain we can carry nothing out
12857,1TI,6,KJV,and having food and raiment let us be therewith content
12858,1TI,6,KJV,but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and
12859,1TI,6,KJV,into
12860,1TI,6,KJV,many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition
12861,1TI,6,KJV,for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
12862,1TI,6,KJV,but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness
12863,1TI,6,KJV,fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses
12864,1TI,6,KJV,i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and
12865,1TI,6,KJV,before
12866,1TI,6,KJV,christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession
12867,1TI,6,KJV,that thou keep
12868,1TI,6,KJV,this
12869,1TI,6,KJV,commandment without spot unrebukeable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ
12870,1TI,6,KJV,which in his times he shall shew
12871,1TI,6,KJV,who is
12872,1TI,6,KJV,the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords
12873,1TI,6,KJV,who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom
12874,1TI,6,KJV,be
12875,1TI,6,KJV,honour and power everlasting amen
12876,1TI,6,KJV,charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy
12877,1TI,6,KJV,that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate
12878,1TI,6,KJV,laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life
12879,1TI,6,KJV,o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane
12880,1TI,6,KJV,and
12881,1TI,6,KJV,vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called
12882,1TI,6,KJV,which some professing have erred concerning the faith grace
12883,1TI,6,KJV,be
12884,1TI,6,KJV,with thee amen
12885,1TI,6,KJV,the first to timothy was written from laodicea which is the chiefest city of phrygia pacatiana
12886,2TI,1,KJV,paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus

12888,2TI,1,KJV,my
12889,2TI,1,KJV,dearly beloved son grace mercy
12890,2TI,1,KJV,and
12891,2TI,1,KJV,peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
12892,2TI,1,KJV,i thank god whom i serve from
12893,2TI,1,KJV,my
12894,2TI,1,KJV,forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day
12895,2TI,1,KJV,greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy
12896,2TI,1,KJV,when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also
12897,2TI,1,KJV,wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands
12898,2TI,1,KJV,for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
12899,2TI,1,KJV,be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god
12900,2TI,1,KJV,who hath saved us and called
12901,2TI,1,KJV,us
12902,2TI,1,KJV,with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began
12903,2TI,1,KJV,but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
12904,2TI,1,KJV,whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles
12905,2TI,1,KJV,for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
12906,2TI,1,KJV,hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus
12907,2TI,1,KJV,that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us
12908,2TI,1,KJV,this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes
12909,2TI,1,KJV,the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain
12910,2TI,1,KJV,but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found
12911,2TI,1,KJV,me
12912,2TI,1,KJV,
12913,2TI,1,KJV,the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus thou knowest very well
12914,2TI,2,KJV,thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus
12915,2TI,2,KJV,and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also
12916,2TI,2,KJV,thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ
12917,2TI,2,KJV,no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
12918,2TI,2,KJV,this
12919,2TI,2,KJV,life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier
12920,2TI,2,KJV,and if a man also strive for masteries
12921,2TI,2,KJV,yet
12922,2TI,2,KJV,is he not crowned except he strive lawfully
12923,2TI,2,KJV,the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits
12924,2TI,2,KJV,consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things
12925,2TI,2,KJV,remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel
12926,2TI,2,KJV,wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer
12927,2TI,2,KJV,even
12928,2TI,2,KJV,unto bonds but the word of god is not bound
12929,2TI,2,KJV,therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory
12930,2TI,2,KJV,it is
12931,2TI,2,KJV,a faithful saying for if we be dead with
12932,2TI,2,KJV,him
12933,2TI,2,KJV,we shall also live with
12934,2TI,2,KJV,him
12935,2TI,2,KJV,
12936,2TI,2,KJV,if we suffer we shall also reign with
12937,2TI,2,KJV,him
12938,2TI,2,KJV,if we deny
12939,2TI,2,KJV,him
12940,2TI,2,KJV,he also will deny us
12941,2TI,2,KJV,if we believe not
12942,2TI,2,KJV,yet
12943,2TI,2,KJV,he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself
12944,2TI,2,KJV,of these things put
12945,2TI,2,KJV,them
12946,2TI,2,KJV,in remembrance charging
12947,2TI,2,KJV,them
12948,2TI,2,KJV,before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit
12949,2TI,2,KJV,but
12950,2TI,2,KJV,to the subverting of the hearers
12951,2TI,2,KJV,study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
12952,2TI,2,KJV,but shun profane
12953,2TI,2,KJV,and
12954,2TI,2,KJV,vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness
12955,2TI,2,KJV,and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus
12956,2TI,2,KJV,who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some
12957,2TI,2,KJV,nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity
12958,2TI,2,KJV,but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonour
12959,2TI,2,KJV,if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the masters use
12960,2TI,2,KJV,and
12961,2TI,2,KJV,prepared unto every good work
12962,2TI,2,KJV,flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart
12963,2TI,2,KJV,but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes
12964,2TI,2,KJV,and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all
12965,2TI,2,KJV,men
12966,2TI,2,KJV,apt to teach patient
12967,2TI,2,KJV,in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth
12968,2TI,2,KJV,and
12969,2TI,2,KJV,that
12970,2TI,2,KJV,they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will
12971,2TI,3,KJV,this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
12972,2TI,3,KJV,for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
12973,2TI,3,KJV,without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good
12974,2TI,3,KJV,traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god
12975,2TI,3,KJV,having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away
12976,2TI,3,KJV,for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts
12977,2TI,3,KJV,ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
12978,2TI,3,KJV,now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith
12979,2TI,3,KJV,but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all
12980,2TI,3,KJV,men
12981,2TI,3,KJV,as theirs also was

12986,2TI,3,KJV,yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
12987,2TI,3,KJV,but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
12988,2TI,3,KJV,but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned
12989,2TI,3,KJV,them
12990,2TI,3,KJV,
12991,2TI,3,KJV,and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus
12992,2TI,3,KJV,all scripture

12994,2TI,3,KJV,given by inspiration of god and
12995,2TI,3,KJV,is
12996,2TI,3,KJV,profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
12997,2TI,3,KJV,that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works
12998,2TI,4,KJV,i charge
12999,2TI,4,KJV,thee

13001,2TI,4,KJV,preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine
13002,2TI,4,KJV,for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears
13003,2TI,4,KJV,and they shall turn away
13004,2TI,4,KJV,their
13005,2TI,4,KJV,ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables
13006,2TI,4,KJV,but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry
13007,2TI,4,KJV,for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand
13008,2TI,4,KJV,i have fought a good fight i have finished
13009,2TI,4,KJV,my
13010,2TI,4,KJV,course i have kept the faith
13011,2TI,4,KJV,henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
13012,2TI,4,KJV,do thy diligence to come shortly unto me
13013,2TI,4,KJV,for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia

13058,TIT,1,KJV,holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers
13059,TIT,1,KJV,for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision
13060,TIT,1,KJV,whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucres sake
13061,TIT,1,KJV,one of themselves
13062,TIT,1,KJV,even
13063,TIT,1,KJV,a prophet of their own said the cretians
13064,TIT,1,KJV,are
13065,TIT,1,KJV,alway liars evil beasts slow bellies
13066,TIT,1,KJV,this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith
13067,TIT,1,KJV,not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth
13068,TIT,1,KJV,unto the pure all things
13069,TIT,1,KJV,are
13070,TIT,1,KJV,pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving
13071,TIT,1,KJV,is
13072,TIT,1,KJV,nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled
13073,TIT,1,KJV,they profess that they know god but in works they deny
13074,TIT,1,KJV,him
13075,TIT,1,KJV,being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate
13076,TIT,2,KJV,but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine
13077,TIT,2,KJV,that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience
13078,TIT,2,KJV,the aged women likewise that
13079,TIT,2,KJV,they be
13080,TIT,2,KJV,in behaviour as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things
13081,TIT,2,KJV,that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children
13082,TIT,2,KJV,to be
13083,TIT,2,KJV,discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed
13084,TIT,2,KJV,young men likewise exhort to be sober minded
13085,TIT,2,KJV,in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine
13086,TIT,2,KJV,shewing
13087,TIT,2,KJV,uncorruptness gravity sincerity
13088,TIT,2,KJV,sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you
13089,TIT,2,KJV,exhort
13090,TIT,2,KJV,servants to be obedient unto their own masters
13091,TIT,2,KJV,and
13092,TIT,2,KJV,to please
13093,TIT,2,KJV,them
13094,TIT,2,KJV,well in all things not answering again
13095,TIT,2,KJV,not purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things
13096,TIT,2,KJV,for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
13097,TIT,2,KJV,teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world
13098,TIT,2,KJV,looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ
13099,TIT,2,KJV,who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works
13100,TIT,2,KJV,these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee
13101,TIT,3,KJV,put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work
13102,TIT,3,KJV,to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers
13103,TIT,3,KJV,but
13104,TIT,3,KJV,gentle shewing all meekness unto all men
13105,TIT,3,KJV,for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful
13106,TIT,3,KJV,and
13107,TIT,3,KJV,hating one another
13108,TIT,3,KJV,but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared
13109,TIT,3,KJV,not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
13110,TIT,3,KJV,which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour
13111,TIT,3,KJV,that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
13112,TIT,3,KJV,this is
13113,TIT,3,KJV,a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men
13114,TIT,3,KJV,but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain
13115,TIT,3,KJV,a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject
13116,TIT,3,KJV,knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself
13117,TIT,3,KJV,when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter
13118,TIT,3,KJV,bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently that nothing be wanting unto them
13119,TIT,3,KJV,and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful
13120,TIT,3,KJV,all that are with me salute thee greet them that love us in the faith grace
13121,TIT,3,KJV,be
13122,TIT,3,KJV,with you all amen
13123,TIT,3,KJV,it was written to titus ordained the first bishop of the church of the cretians from nicopolis of macedonia

13129,PHM,1,KJV,beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house
13130,PHM,1,KJV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
13131,PHM,1,KJV,i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers
13132,PHM,1,KJV,hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all saints
13133,PHM,1,KJV,that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus
13134,PHM,1,KJV,for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother
13135,PHM,1,KJV,wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient
13136,PHM,1,KJV,yet for loves sake i rather beseech
13137,PHM,1,KJV,thee
13138,PHM,1,KJV,being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ
13139,PHM,1,KJV,i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds
13140,PHM,1,KJV,which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me
13141,PHM,1,KJV,whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels
13142,PHM,1,KJV,whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel
13143,PHM,1,KJV,but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly
13144,PHM,1,KJV,for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever
13145,PHM,1,KJV,not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord
13146,PHM,1,KJV,if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself
13147,PHM,1,KJV,if he hath wronged thee or oweth
13148,PHM,1,KJV,thee
13149,PHM,1,KJV,ought put that on mine account
13150,PHM,1,KJV,i paul have written

13152,PHM,1,KJV,with mine own hand i will repay
13153,PHM,1,KJV,it
13154,PHM,1,KJV,albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides
13155,PHM,1,KJV,yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord
13156,PHM,1,KJV,having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say
13157,PHM,1,KJV,but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you

13160,PHM,1,KJV,the grace of our lord jesus christ
13161,PHM,1,KJV,be
13162,PHM,1,KJV,with your spirit amen
13163,PHM,1,KJV,written from rome to philemon by onesimus a servant
13164,HEB,1,KJV,god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets
13165,HEB,1,KJV,hath in these last days spoken unto us by
13166,HEB,1,KJV,his
13167,HEB,1,KJV,son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds
13168,HEB,1,KJV,who being the brightness of
13169,HEB,1,KJV,his
13170,HEB,1,KJV,glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high
13171,HEB,1,KJV,being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they
13172,HEB,1,KJV,for unto which of the angels said he at any time
13173,HEB,1,KJV,thou art my son
13174,HEB,1,KJV,this day have i begotten thee
13175,HEB,1,KJV,and again
13176,HEB,1,KJV,i will be to him a father
13177,HEB,1,KJV,and he shall be to me a son
13178,HEB,1,KJV,and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him
13179,HEB,1,KJV,and of the angels he saith
13180,HEB,1,KJV,who maketh his angels spirits
13181,HEB,1,KJV,and his ministers a flame of fire
13182,HEB,1,KJV,but unto the son
13183,HEB,1,KJV,he saith
13184,HEB,1,KJV,thy throne o god
13185,HEB,1,KJV,is
13186,HEB,1,KJV,for ever and ever
13187,HEB,1,KJV,a sceptre of righteousness
13188,HEB,1,KJV,is
13189,HEB,1,KJV,the sceptre of thy kingdom
13190,HEB,1,KJV,thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity
13191,HEB,1,KJV,therefore god
13192,HEB,1,KJV,even
13193,HEB,1,KJV,thy god hath anointed thee
13194,HEB,1,KJV,with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
13195,HEB,1,KJV,and
13196,HEB,1,KJV,thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth
13197,HEB,1,KJV,and the heavens are the works of thine hands
13198,HEB,1,KJV,they shall perish but thou remainest
13199,HEB,1,KJV,and they all shall wax old as doth a garment
13200,HEB,1,KJV,and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up
13201,HEB,1,KJV,and they shall be changed
13202,HEB,1,KJV,but thou art the same
13203,HEB,1,KJV,and thy years shall not fail
13204,HEB,1,KJV,but to which of the angels said he at any time
13205,HEB,1,KJV,sit on my right hand
13206,HEB,1,KJV,until i make thine enemies thy footstool
13207,HEB,1,KJV,are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation
13208,HEB,2,KJV,therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let
13209,HEB,2,KJV,them
13210,HEB,2,KJV,slip
13211,HEB,2,KJV,for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward
13212,HEB,2,KJV,how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard
13213,HEB,2,KJV,him
13214,HEB,2,KJV,
13215,HEB,2,KJV,god also bearing
13216,HEB,2,KJV,them
13217,HEB,2,KJV,witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will
13218,HEB,2,KJV,for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak
13219,HEB,2,KJV,but one in a certain place testified saying
13220,HEB,2,KJV,what is man that thou art mindful of him
13221,HEB,2,KJV,or the son of man that thou visitest him
13222,HEB,2,KJV,thou madest him a little lower than the angels
13223,HEB,2,KJV,thou crownedst him with glory and honour
13224,HEB,2,KJV,and didst set him over the works of thy hands
13225,HEB,2,KJV,thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet
13226,HEB,2,KJV,for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing
13227,HEB,2,KJV,that is
13228,HEB,2,KJV,not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him
13229,HEB,2,KJV,but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
13230,HEB,2,KJV,for it became him for whom
13231,HEB,2,KJV,are
13232,HEB,2,KJV,all things and by whom
13233,HEB,2,KJV,are
13234,HEB,2,KJV,all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings
13235,HEB,2,KJV,for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
13236,HEB,2,KJV,are
13237,HEB,2,KJV,all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren
13238,HEB,2,KJV,saying
13239,HEB,2,KJV,i will declare thy name unto my brethren
13240,HEB,2,KJV,in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee
13241,HEB,2,KJV,and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me
13242,HEB,2,KJV,forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil
13243,HEB,2,KJV,and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage
13244,HEB,2,KJV,for verily he took not on
13245,HEB,2,KJV,him the nature of
13246,HEB,2,KJV,angels but he took on
13247,HEB,2,KJV,him
13248,HEB,2,KJV,the seed of abraham
13249,HEB,2,KJV,wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
13250,HEB,2,KJV,his
13251,HEB,2,KJV,brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things
13252,HEB,2,KJV,pertaining
13253,HEB,2,KJV,to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people
13254,HEB,2,KJV,for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted
13255,HEB,3,KJV,wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus
13256,HEB,3,KJV,who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses
13257,HEB,3,KJV,was faithful
13258,HEB,3,KJV,in all his house
13259,HEB,3,KJV,for this
13260,HEB,3,KJV,man
13261,HEB,3,KJV,was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house
13262,HEB,3,KJV,for every house is builded by some
13263,HEB,3,KJV,man
13264,HEB,3,KJV,but he that built all things
13265,HEB,3,KJV,is
13266,HEB,3,KJV,god
13267,HEB,3,KJV,and moses verily
13268,HEB,3,KJV,was
13269,HEB,3,KJV,faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after
13270,HEB,3,KJV,but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
13271,HEB,3,KJV,wherefore as the holy ghost saith
13272,HEB,3,KJV,to day if ye will hear his voice
13273,HEB,3,KJV,harden not your hearts as in the provocation
13274,HEB,3,KJV,in the day of temptation in the wilderness
13275,HEB,3,KJV,when your fathers tempted me proved me
13276,HEB,3,KJV,and saw my works forty years
13277,HEB,3,KJV,wherefore i was grieved with that generation
13278,HEB,3,KJV,and said they do alway err in
13279,HEB,3,KJV,their
13280,HEB,3,KJV,heart
13281,HEB,3,KJV,and they have not known my ways
13282,HEB,3,KJV,so i sware in my wrath
13283,HEB,3,KJV,they shall not enter into my rest
13284,HEB,3,KJV,take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god
13285,HEB,3,KJV,but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
13286,HEB,3,KJV,for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end
13287,HEB,3,KJV,while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation
13288,HEB,3,KJV,for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses
13289,HEB,3,KJV,but with whom was he grieved forty years
13290,HEB,3,KJV,was it
13291,HEB,3,KJV,not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness
13292,HEB,3,KJV,and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not
13293,HEB,3,KJV,so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief
13294,HEB,4,KJV,let us therefore fear lest a promise being left
13295,HEB,4,KJV,us
13296,HEB,4,KJV,of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it
13297,HEB,4,KJV,for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard
13298,HEB,4,KJV,it
13299,HEB,4,KJV,
13300,HEB,4,KJV,for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said
13301,HEB,4,KJV,as i have sworn in my wrath
13302,HEB,4,KJV,if they shall enter into my rest
13303,HEB,4,KJV,although the works were finished from the foundation of the world
13304,HEB,4,KJV,for he spake in a certain place of the seventh
13305,HEB,4,KJV,day
13306,HEB,4,KJV,on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works
13307,HEB,4,KJV,and in this
13308,HEB,4,KJV,place
13309,HEB,4,KJV,again
13310,HEB,4,KJV,if they shall enter into my rest
13311,HEB,4,KJV,seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
13312,HEB,4,KJV,again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said
13313,HEB,4,KJV,to day if ye will hear his voice
13314,HEB,4,KJV,harden not your hearts
13315,HEB,4,KJV,for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day
13316,HEB,4,KJV,there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god
13317,HEB,4,KJV,for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god
13318,HEB,4,KJV,did
13319,HEB,4,KJV,from his
13320,HEB,4,KJV,let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
13321,HEB,4,KJV,for the word of god
13322,HEB,4,KJV,is
13323,HEB,4,KJV,quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and
13324,HEB,4,KJV,is
13325,HEB,4,KJV,a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
13326,HEB,4,KJV,neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things
13327,HEB,4,KJV,are
13328,HEB,4,KJV,naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do
13329,HEB,4,KJV,seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast
13330,HEB,4,KJV,our
13331,HEB,4,KJV,profession
13332,HEB,4,KJV,for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as
13333,HEB,4,KJV,we are yet
13334,HEB,4,KJV,without sin
13335,HEB,4,KJV,let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
13336,HEB,5,KJV,for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things
13337,HEB,5,KJV,pertaining
13338,HEB,5,KJV,to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
13339,HEB,5,KJV,who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
13340,HEB,5,KJV,and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins
13341,HEB,5,KJV,and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as
13342,HEB,5,KJV,was
13343,HEB,5,KJV,aaron
13344,HEB,5,KJV,so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him
13345,HEB,5,KJV,thou art my son
13346,HEB,5,KJV,to day have i begotten thee
13347,HEB,5,KJV,as he saith also in another
13348,HEB,5,KJV,place
13349,HEB,5,KJV,thou
13350,HEB,5,KJV,art
13351,HEB,5,KJV,a priest for ever
13352,HEB,5,KJV,after the order of melchisedec
13353,HEB,5,KJV,who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared
13354,HEB,5,KJV,though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
13355,HEB,5,KJV,and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him
13356,HEB,5,KJV,called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec
13357,HEB,5,KJV,of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing
13358,HEB,5,KJV,for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which
13359,HEB,5,KJV,be
13360,HEB,5,KJV,the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat
13361,HEB,5,KJV,for every one that useth milk
13362,HEB,5,KJV,is
13363,HEB,5,KJV,unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe
13364,HEB,5,KJV,but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age
13365,HEB,5,KJV,even
13366,HEB,5,KJV,those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil
13367,HEB,6,KJV,therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god
13368,HEB,6,KJV,of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment
13369,HEB,6,KJV,and this will we do if god permit
13370,HEB,6,KJV,for
13371,HEB,6,KJV,it is
13372,HEB,6,KJV,impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost
13373,HEB,6,KJV,and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come
13374,HEB,6,KJV,if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put
13375,HEB,6,KJV,him
13376,HEB,6,KJV,to an open shame
13377,HEB,6,KJV,for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god
13378,HEB,6,KJV,but that which beareth thorns and briers
13379,HEB,6,KJV,is
13380,HEB,6,KJV,rejected and
13381,HEB,6,KJV,is
13382,HEB,6,KJV,nigh unto cursing whose end
13383,HEB,6,KJV,is
13384,HEB,6,KJV,to be burned
13385,HEB,6,KJV,but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak
13386,HEB,6,KJV,for god
13387,HEB,6,KJV,is
13388,HEB,6,KJV,not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister
13389,HEB,6,KJV,and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end
13390,HEB,6,KJV,that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises
13391,HEB,6,KJV,for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself
13392,HEB,6,KJV,saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee
13393,HEB,6,KJV,and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise
13394,HEB,6,KJV,for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation
13395,HEB,6,KJV,is
13396,HEB,6,KJV,to them an end of all strife
13397,HEB,6,KJV,wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed
13398,HEB,6,KJV,it
13399,HEB,6,KJV,by an oath
13400,HEB,6,KJV,that by two immutable things in which
13401,HEB,6,KJV,it was
13402,HEB,6,KJV,impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us
13403,HEB,6,KJV,which
13404,HEB,6,KJV,hope
13405,HEB,6,KJV,we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil
13406,HEB,6,KJV,whither the forerunner is for us entered
13407,HEB,6,KJV,even
13408,HEB,6,KJV,jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
13409,HEB,7,KJV,for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him
13410,HEB,7,KJV,to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace
13411,HEB,7,KJV,without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually
13412,HEB,7,KJV,now consider how great this man
13413,HEB,7,KJV,was
13414,HEB,7,KJV,unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils
13415,HEB,7,KJV,and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham
13416,HEB,7,KJV,but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises
13417,HEB,7,KJV,and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
13418,HEB,7,KJV,and here men that die receive tithes but there he
13419,HEB,7,KJV,receiveth them
13420,HEB,7,KJV,of whom it is witnessed that he liveth
13421,HEB,7,KJV,and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham
13422,HEB,7,KJV,for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him
13423,HEB,7,KJV,if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need
13424,HEB,7,KJV,was there
13425,HEB,7,KJV,that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron
13426,HEB,7,KJV,for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law
13427,HEB,7,KJV,for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar
13428,HEB,7,KJV,for
13429,HEB,7,KJV,it is
13430,HEB,7,KJV,evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood
13431,HEB,7,KJV,and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest
13432,HEB,7,KJV,who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life
13433,HEB,7,KJV,for he testifieth
13434,HEB,7,KJV,thou
13435,HEB,7,KJV,art
13436,HEB,7,KJV,a priest for ever
13437,HEB,7,KJV,after the order of melchisedec
13438,HEB,7,KJV,for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
13439,HEB,7,KJV,for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope
13440,HEB,7,KJV,did
13441,HEB,7,KJV,by the which we draw nigh unto god
13442,HEB,7,KJV,and inasmuch as not without an oath
13443,HEB,7,KJV,he was made priest
13444,HEB,7,KJV,
13445,HEB,7,KJV,for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him
13446,HEB,7,KJV,the lord sware and will not repent
13447,HEB,7,KJV,thou
13448,HEB,7,KJV,art
13449,HEB,7,KJV,a priest for ever
13450,HEB,7,KJV,after the order of melchisedec
13451,HEB,7,KJV,by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament
13452,HEB,7,KJV,and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death
13453,HEB,7,KJV,but this
13454,HEB,7,KJV,man
13455,HEB,7,KJV,because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood
13456,HEB,7,KJV,wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them
13457,HEB,7,KJV,for such an high priest became us
13458,HEB,7,KJV,who is
13459,HEB,7,KJV,holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens
13460,HEB,7,KJV,who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself
13461,HEB,7,KJV,for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law
13462,HEB,7,KJV,maketh
13463,HEB,7,KJV,the son who is consecrated for evermore
13464,HEB,8,KJV,now of the things which we have spoken
13465,HEB,8,KJV,this is
13466,HEB,8,KJV,the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens
13467,HEB,8,KJV,a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man
13468,HEB,8,KJV,for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore
13469,HEB,8,KJV,it is
13470,HEB,8,KJV,of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer
13471,HEB,8,KJV,for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law
13472,HEB,8,KJV,who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he
13473,HEB,8,KJV,that
13474,HEB,8,KJV,thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount
13475,HEB,8,KJV,but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises
13476,HEB,8,KJV,for if that first
13477,HEB,8,KJV,covenant
13478,HEB,8,KJV,had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second
13479,HEB,8,KJV,for finding fault with them he saith
13480,HEB,8,KJV,behold the days come saith the lord
13481,HEB,8,KJV,when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
13482,HEB,8,KJV,not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers
13483,HEB,8,KJV,in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt
13484,HEB,8,KJV,because they continued not in my covenant
13485,HEB,8,KJV,and i regarded them not saith the lord
13486,HEB,8,KJV,for this
13487,HEB,8,KJV,is
13488,HEB,8,KJV,the covenant that i will make with the house of israel
13489,HEB,8,KJV,after those days saith the lord
13490,HEB,8,KJV,i will put my laws into their mind
13491,HEB,8,KJV,and write them in their hearts
13492,HEB,8,KJV,and i will be to them a god
13493,HEB,8,KJV,and they shall be to me a people
13494,HEB,8,KJV,and they shall not teach every man his neighbour
13495,HEB,8,KJV,and every man his brother saying know the lord
13496,HEB,8,KJV,for all shall know me
13497,HEB,8,KJV,from the least to the greatest
13498,HEB,8,KJV,for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness
13499,HEB,8,KJV,and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more
13500,HEB,8,KJV,in that he saith a new
13501,HEB,8,KJV,covenant
13502,HEB,8,KJV,he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old
13503,HEB,8,KJV,is
13504,HEB,8,KJV,ready to vanish away
13505,HEB,9,KJV,then verily the first
13506,HEB,9,KJV,covenant
13507,HEB,9,KJV,had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary
13508,HEB,9,KJV,for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein
13509,HEB,9,KJV,was
13510,HEB,9,KJV,the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary
13511,HEB,9,KJV,and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all
13512,HEB,9,KJV,which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein
13513,HEB,9,KJV,was
13514,HEB,9,KJV,the golden pot that had manna and aarons rod that budded and the tables of the covenant
13515,HEB,9,KJV,and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly
13516,HEB,9,KJV,now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service
13517,HEB,9,KJV,of god
13518,HEB,9,KJV,
13519,HEB,9,KJV,but into the second
13520,HEB,9,KJV,went
13521,HEB,9,KJV,the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and
13522,HEB,9,KJV,for
13523,HEB,9,KJV,the errors of the people
13524,HEB,9,KJV,the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing
13525,HEB,9,KJV,which
13526,HEB,9,KJV,was
13527,HEB,9,KJV,a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience
13528,HEB,9,KJV,which stood
13529,HEB,9,KJV,only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed
13530,HEB,9,KJV,on them
13531,HEB,9,KJV,until the time of reformation
13532,HEB,9,KJV,but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building
13533,HEB,9,KJV,neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption
13534,HEB,9,KJV,for us
13535,HEB,9,KJV,
13536,HEB,9,KJV,for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh
13537,HEB,9,KJV,how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god
13538,HEB,9,KJV,and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions
13539,HEB,9,KJV,that were
13540,HEB,9,KJV,under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance
13541,HEB,9,KJV,for where a testament
13542,HEB,9,KJV,is
13543,HEB,9,KJV,there must also of necessity be the death of the testator
13544,HEB,9,KJV,for a testament
13545,HEB,9,KJV,is
13546,HEB,9,KJV,of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth
13547,HEB,9,KJV,whereupon neither the first
13548,HEB,9,KJV,testament
13549,HEB,9,KJV,was dedicated without blood
13550,HEB,9,KJV,for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people
13551,HEB,9,KJV,saying this
13552,HEB,9,KJV,is
13553,HEB,9,KJV,the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you
13554,HEB,9,KJV,moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry
13555,HEB,9,KJV,and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission
13556,HEB,9,KJV,it was
13557,HEB,9,KJV,therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
13558,HEB,9,KJV,for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands
13559,HEB,9,KJV,which are
13560,HEB,9,KJV,the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us
13561,HEB,9,KJV,nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others
13562,HEB,9,KJV,for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
13563,HEB,9,KJV,and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
13564,HEB,9,KJV,so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation
13565,HEB,10,KJV,for the law having a shadow of good things to come
13566,HEB,10,KJV,and
13567,HEB,10,KJV,not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect
13568,HEB,10,KJV,for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins
13569,HEB,10,KJV,but in those
13570,HEB,10,KJV,sacrifices there is
13571,HEB,10,KJV,a remembrance again
13572,HEB,10,KJV,made
13573,HEB,10,KJV,of sins every year
13574,HEB,10,KJV,for
13575,HEB,10,KJV,it is
13576,HEB,10,KJV,not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins
13577,HEB,10,KJV,wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith
13578,HEB,10,KJV,sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not
13579,HEB,10,KJV,but a body hast thou prepared me
13580,HEB,10,KJV,in burnt offerings and
13581,HEB,10,KJV,sacrifices
13582,HEB,10,KJV,for sin thou hast had no pleasure
13583,HEB,10,KJV,then said i lo i come
13584,HEB,10,KJV,in the volume of the book it is written of me
13585,HEB,10,KJV,to do thy will o god
13586,HEB,10,KJV,above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and
13587,HEB,10,KJV,offering
13588,HEB,10,KJV,for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure
13589,HEB,10,KJV,therein
13590,HEB,10,KJV,which are offered by the law
13591,HEB,10,KJV,then said he lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second
13592,HEB,10,KJV,by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once
13593,HEB,10,KJV,for all
13594,HEB,10,KJV,
13595,HEB,10,KJV,and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
13596,HEB,10,KJV,but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god
13597,HEB,10,KJV,from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool
13598,HEB,10,KJV,for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified
13599,HEB,10,KJV,whereof
13600,HEB,10,KJV,the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before
13601,HEB,10,KJV,this
13602,HEB,10,KJV,is
13603,HEB,10,KJV,the covenant that i will make with them
13604,HEB,10,KJV,after those days saith the lord
13605,HEB,10,KJV,i will put my laws into their hearts
13606,HEB,10,KJV,and in their minds will i write them
13607,HEB,10,KJV,and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more
13608,HEB,10,KJV,now where remission of these
13609,HEB,10,KJV,is there is
13610,HEB,10,KJV,no more offering for sin
13611,HEB,10,KJV,having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus
13612,HEB,10,KJV,by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
13613,HEB,10,KJV,and
13614,HEB,10,KJV,having
13615,HEB,10,KJV,an high priest over the house of god
13616,HEB,10,KJV,let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
13617,HEB,10,KJV,let us hold fast the profession of
13618,HEB,10,KJV,our
13619,HEB,10,KJV,faith without wavering for he
13620,HEB,10,KJV,is
13621,HEB,10,KJV,faithful that promised
13622,HEB,10,KJV,and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works
13623,HEB,10,KJV,not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some
13624,HEB,10,KJV,is
13625,HEB,10,KJV,but exhorting
13626,HEB,10,KJV,one another
13627,HEB,10,KJV,and so much the more as ye see the day approaching
13628,HEB,10,KJV,for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins
13629,HEB,10,KJV,but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries
13630,HEB,10,KJV,he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses
13631,HEB,10,KJV,of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
13632,HEB,10,KJV,for we know him that hath said vengeance
13633,HEB,10,KJV,belongeth
13634,HEB,10,KJV,unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people
13635,HEB,10,KJV,it is
13636,HEB,10,KJV,a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
13637,HEB,10,KJV,but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions
13638,HEB,10,KJV,partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used
13639,HEB,10,KJV,for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance
13640,HEB,10,KJV,cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward
13641,HEB,10,KJV,for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise
13642,HEB,10,KJV,for yet a little while
13643,HEB,10,KJV,and he that shall come will come and will not tarry
13644,HEB,10,KJV,now the just shall live by faith
13645,HEB,10,KJV,but if
13646,HEB,10,KJV,any man
13647,HEB,10,KJV,draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him
13648,HEB,10,KJV,but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
13649,HEB,11,KJV,now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
13650,HEB,11,KJV,for by it the elders obtained a good report
13651,HEB,11,KJV,through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
13652,HEB,11,KJV,by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh
13653,HEB,11,KJV,by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god
13654,HEB,11,KJV,but without faith
13655,HEB,11,KJV,it is
13656,HEB,11,KJV,impossible to please
13657,HEB,11,KJV,him
13658,HEB,11,KJV,for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and
13659,HEB,11,KJV,that
13660,HEB,11,KJV,he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
13661,HEB,11,KJV,by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith
13662,HEB,11,KJV,by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went
13663,HEB,11,KJV,by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as
13664,HEB,11,KJV,in
13665,HEB,11,KJV,a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise
13666,HEB,11,KJV,for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker
13667,HEB,11,KJV,is
13668,HEB,11,KJV,god
13669,HEB,11,KJV,through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised
13670,HEB,11,KJV,therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead
13671,HEB,11,KJV,so many
13672,HEB,11,KJV,as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable
13673,HEB,11,KJV,these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of
13674,HEB,11,KJV,them
13675,HEB,11,KJV,and embraced
13676,HEB,11,KJV,them
13677,HEB,11,KJV,and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
13678,HEB,11,KJV,for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country
13679,HEB,11,KJV,and truly if they had been mindful of that
13680,HEB,11,KJV,country
13681,HEB,11,KJV,from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned
13682,HEB,11,KJV,but now they desire a better
13683,HEB,11,KJV,country
13684,HEB,11,KJV,that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city
13685,HEB,11,KJV,by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
13686,HEB,11,KJV,son
13687,HEB,11,KJV,
13688,HEB,11,KJV,of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called
13689,HEB,11,KJV,accounting that god
13690,HEB,11,KJV,was
13691,HEB,11,KJV,able to raise
13692,HEB,11,KJV,him
13693,HEB,11,KJV,up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure
13694,HEB,11,KJV,by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come
13695,HEB,11,KJV,by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped
13696,HEB,11,KJV,leaning
13697,HEB,11,KJV,upon the top of his staff
13698,HEB,11,KJV,by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones
13699,HEB,11,KJV,by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw
13700,HEB,11,KJV,he was
13701,HEB,11,KJV,a proper child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment
13702,HEB,11,KJV,by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter
13703,HEB,11,KJV,choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
13704,HEB,11,KJV,esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward
13705,HEB,11,KJV,by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible
13706,HEB,11,KJV,through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them
13707,HEB,11,KJV,by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry
13708,HEB,11,KJV,land
13709,HEB,11,KJV,which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned
13710,HEB,11,KJV,by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days
13711,HEB,11,KJV,by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace
13712,HEB,11,KJV,and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and
13713,HEB,11,KJV,of
13714,HEB,11,KJV,barak and
13715,HEB,11,KJV,of
13716,HEB,11,KJV,samson and
13717,HEB,11,KJV,of
13718,HEB,11,KJV,jephthae
13719,HEB,11,KJV,of
13720,HEB,11,KJV,david also and samuel and
13721,HEB,11,KJV,of
13722,HEB,11,KJV,the prophets
13723,HEB,11,KJV,who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions
13724,HEB,11,KJV,quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens
13725,HEB,11,KJV,women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection
13726,HEB,11,KJV,and others had trial of
13727,HEB,11,KJV,cruel
13728,HEB,11,KJV,mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment
13729,HEB,11,KJV,they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented
13730,HEB,11,KJV,of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and
13731,HEB,11,KJV,in
13732,HEB,11,KJV,mountains and
13733,HEB,11,KJV,in
13734,HEB,11,KJV,dens and caves of the earth
13735,HEB,11,KJV,and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise
13736,HEB,11,KJV,god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect
13737,HEB,12,KJV,wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset
13738,HEB,12,KJV,us
13739,HEB,12,KJV,and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
13740,HEB,12,KJV,looking unto jesus the author and finisher of
13741,HEB,12,KJV,our
13742,HEB,12,KJV,faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god
13743,HEB,12,KJV,for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds
13744,HEB,12,KJV,ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin
13745,HEB,12,KJV,and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children
13746,HEB,12,KJV,my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord
13747,HEB,12,KJV,nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
13748,HEB,12,KJV,for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
13749,HEB,12,KJV,and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
13750,HEB,12,KJV,if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not
13751,HEB,12,KJV,but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons
13752,HEB,12,KJV,furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
13753,HEB,12,KJV,us
13754,HEB,12,KJV,and we gave
13755,HEB,12,KJV,them
13756,HEB,12,KJV,reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live
13757,HEB,12,KJV,for they verily for a few days chastened
13758,HEB,12,KJV,us
13759,HEB,12,KJV,after their own pleasure but he for
13760,HEB,12,KJV,our
13761,HEB,12,KJV,profit that
13762,HEB,12,KJV,we
13763,HEB,12,KJV,might be partakers of his holiness
13764,HEB,12,KJV,now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby
13765,HEB,12,KJV,wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees
13766,HEB,12,KJV,and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed
13767,HEB,12,KJV,follow peace with all
13768,HEB,12,KJV,men
13769,HEB,12,KJV,and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
13770,HEB,12,KJV,looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble
13771,HEB,12,KJV,you
13772,HEB,12,KJV,and thereby many be defiled
13773,HEB,12,KJV,lest there
13774,HEB,12,KJV,be
13775,HEB,12,KJV,any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright
13776,HEB,12,KJV,for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears
13777,HEB,12,KJV,for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest
13778,HEB,12,KJV,and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which
13779,HEB,12,KJV,voice
13780,HEB,12,KJV,they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more
13781,HEB,12,KJV,for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart
13782,HEB,12,KJV,and so terrible was the sight
13783,HEB,12,KJV,that
13784,HEB,12,KJV,moses said i exceedingly fear and quake
13785,HEB,12,KJV,but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels
13786,HEB,12,KJV,to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect
13787,HEB,12,KJV,and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than
13788,HEB,12,KJV,that of
13789,HEB,12,KJV,abel
13790,HEB,12,KJV,see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more
13791,HEB,12,KJV,shall not
13792,HEB,12,KJV,we
13793,HEB,12,KJV,escape
13794,HEB,12,KJV,if we turn away from him that
13795,HEB,12,KJV,speaketh
13796,HEB,12,KJV,from heaven
13797,HEB,12,KJV,whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven
13798,HEB,12,KJV,and this
13799,HEB,12,KJV,word
13800,HEB,12,KJV,yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain
13801,HEB,12,KJV,wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear
13802,HEB,12,KJV,for our god
13803,HEB,12,KJV,is
13804,HEB,12,KJV,a consuming fire
13805,HEB,13,KJV,let brotherly love continue
13806,HEB,13,KJV,be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares
13807,HEB,13,KJV,remember them that are in bonds as bound with them
13808,HEB,13,KJV,and
13809,HEB,13,KJV,them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body
13810,HEB,13,KJV,marriage
13811,HEB,13,KJV,is
13812,HEB,13,KJV,honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge
13813,HEB,13,KJV,let your
13814,HEB,13,KJV,conversation
13815,HEB,13,KJV,be
13816,HEB,13,KJV,without covetousness
13817,HEB,13,KJV,and be
13818,HEB,13,KJV,content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
13819,HEB,13,KJV,so that we may boldly say
13820,HEB,13,KJV,the lord
13821,HEB,13,KJV,is
13822,HEB,13,KJV,my helper and i will not fear
13823,HEB,13,KJV,what man shall do unto me
13824,HEB,13,KJV,remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of
13825,HEB,13,KJV,their
13826,HEB,13,KJV,conversation
13827,HEB,13,KJV,jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever
13828,HEB,13,KJV,be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for
13829,HEB,13,KJV,it is
13830,HEB,13,KJV,a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein
13831,HEB,13,KJV,we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle
13832,HEB,13,KJV,for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp
13833,HEB,13,KJV,wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate
13834,HEB,13,KJV,let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach
13835,HEB,13,KJV,for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come
13836,HEB,13,KJV,by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of
13837,HEB,13,KJV,our
13838,HEB,13,KJV,lips giving thanks to his name
13839,HEB,13,KJV,but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased
13840,HEB,13,KJV,obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that
13841,HEB,13,KJV,is
13842,HEB,13,KJV,unprofitable for you
13843,HEB,13,KJV,pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly
13844,HEB,13,KJV,but i beseech
13845,HEB,13,KJV,you
13846,HEB,13,KJV,the rather to do this that i may be restored to you the sooner
13847,HEB,13,KJV,now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant
13848,HEB,13,KJV,make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom
13849,HEB,13,KJV,be
13850,HEB,13,KJV,glory for ever and ever amen
13851,HEB,13,KJV,and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for i have written a letter unto you in few words
13852,HEB,13,KJV,know ye that
13853,HEB,13,KJV,our
13854,HEB,13,KJV,brother timothy is set at liberty with whom if he come shortly i will see you
13855,HEB,13,KJV,salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints they of italy salute you
13856,HEB,13,KJV,grace
13857,HEB,13,KJV,be
13858,HEB,13,KJV,with you all amen
13859,HEB,13,KJV,written to the hebrews from italy by timothy
13860,JAS,1,KJV,james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting
13861,JAS,1,KJV,my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations
13862,JAS,1,KJV,knowing
13863,JAS,1,KJV,this
13864,JAS,1,KJV,that the trying of your faith worketh patience
13865,JAS,1,KJV,but let patience have
13866,JAS,1,KJV,her
13867,JAS,1,KJV,perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing
13868,JAS,1,KJV,if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all
13869,JAS,1,KJV,men
13870,JAS,1,KJV,liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
13871,JAS,1,KJV,but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
13872,JAS,1,KJV,for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord
13873,JAS,1,KJV,a double minded man
13874,JAS,1,KJV,is
13875,JAS,1,KJV,unstable in all his ways
13876,JAS,1,KJV,let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
13877,JAS,1,KJV,but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away
13878,JAS,1,KJV,for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways
13879,JAS,1,KJV,blessed
13880,JAS,1,KJV,is
13881,JAS,1,KJV,the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him
13882,JAS,1,KJV,let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man
13883,JAS,1,KJV,but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed
13884,JAS,1,KJV,then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death
13885,JAS,1,KJV,do not err my beloved brethren
13886,JAS,1,KJV,every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning
13887,JAS,1,KJV,of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
13888,JAS,1,KJV,wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath
13889,JAS,1,KJV,for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god
13890,JAS,1,KJV,wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls
13891,JAS,1,KJV,but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves
13892,JAS,1,KJV,for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
13893,JAS,1,KJV,for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was
13894,JAS,1,KJV,but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth
13895,JAS,1,KJV,therein
13896,JAS,1,KJV,he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed
13897,JAS,1,KJV,if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion
13898,JAS,1,KJV,is
13899,JAS,1,KJV,vain
13900,JAS,1,KJV,pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction
13901,JAS,1,KJV,and
13902,JAS,1,KJV,to keep himself unspotted from the world
13903,JAS,2,KJV,my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ
13904,JAS,2,KJV,the lord
13905,JAS,2,KJV,of glory with respect of persons
13906,JAS,2,KJV,for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment
13907,JAS,2,KJV,and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool
13908,JAS,2,KJV,are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts
13909,JAS,2,KJV,hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
13910,JAS,2,KJV,but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats
13911,JAS,2,KJV,do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
13912,JAS,2,KJV,if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do well
13913,JAS,2,KJV,but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors
13914,JAS,2,KJV,for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one
13915,JAS,2,KJV,point
13916,JAS,2,KJV,he is guilty of all
13917,JAS,2,KJV,for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law
13918,JAS,2,KJV,so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty
13919,JAS,2,KJV,for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment
13920,JAS,2,KJV,what
13921,JAS,2,KJV,doth it
13922,JAS,2,KJV,profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him
13923,JAS,2,KJV,if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food
13924,JAS,2,KJV,and one of you say unto them depart in peace be
13925,JAS,2,KJV,ye
13926,JAS,2,KJV,warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what
13927,JAS,2,KJV,doth it
13928,JAS,2,KJV,profit
13929,JAS,2,KJV,even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
13930,JAS,2,KJV,yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
13931,JAS,2,KJV,thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
13932,JAS,2,KJV,but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
13933,JAS,2,KJV,was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar
13934,JAS,2,KJV,seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
13935,JAS,2,KJV,and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god
13936,JAS,2,KJV,ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
13937,JAS,2,KJV,likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent
13938,JAS,2,KJV,them
13939,JAS,2,KJV,out another way
13940,JAS,2,KJV,for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also
13941,JAS,3,KJV,my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation
13942,JAS,3,KJV,for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same
13943,JAS,3,KJV,is
13944,JAS,3,KJV,a perfect man
13945,JAS,3,KJV,and
13946,JAS,3,KJV,able also to bridle the whole body
13947,JAS,3,KJV,behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body
13948,JAS,3,KJV,behold also the ships which though
13949,JAS,3,KJV,they be
13950,JAS,3,KJV,so great and
13951,JAS,3,KJV,are
13952,JAS,3,KJV,driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth
13953,JAS,3,KJV,even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth
13954,JAS,3,KJV,and the tongue
13955,JAS,3,KJV,is
13956,JAS,3,KJV,a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell
13957,JAS,3,KJV,for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind

14092,1PE,1,KJV,as
14093,1PE,1,KJV,silver and gold from your vain conversation
14094,1PE,1,KJV,received
14095,1PE,1,KJV,by tradition from your fathers
14096,1PE,1,KJV,but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
14097,1PE,1,KJV,who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you

14102,1PE,1,KJV,being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
14103,1PE,1,KJV,for
14104,1PE,1,KJV,all flesh
14105,1PE,1,KJV,is
14106,1PE,1,KJV,as grass
14107,1PE,1,KJV,and all the glory of man as the flower of grass
14108,1PE,1,KJV,the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away
14109,1PE,1,KJV,but the word of the lord endureth for ever
14110,1PE,1,KJV,and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you
14111,1PE,2,KJV,wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings
14112,1PE,2,KJV,as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby
14113,1PE,2,KJV,if so be ye have tasted that the lord
14114,1PE,2,KJV,is
14115,1PE,2,KJV,gracious
14116,1PE,2,KJV,to whom coming
14117,1PE,2,KJV,as unto
14118,1PE,2,KJV,a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god
14119,1PE,2,KJV,and
14120,1PE,2,KJV,precious
14121,1PE,2,KJV,ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
14122,1PE,2,KJV,wherefore also it is contained in the scripture
14123,1PE,2,KJV,behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious
14124,1PE,2,KJV,and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded
14125,1PE,2,KJV,unto you therefore which believe
14126,1PE,2,KJV,he is
14127,1PE,2,KJV,precious but unto them which be disobedient
14128,1PE,2,KJV,the stone which the builders disallowed
14129,1PE,2,KJV,the same is made the head of the corner
14130,1PE,2,KJV,and
14131,1PE,2,KJV,a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence
14132,1PE,2,KJV,even to them
14133,1PE,2,KJV,which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
14134,1PE,2,KJV,but ye
14135,1PE,2,KJV,are
14136,1PE,2,KJV,a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
14137,1PE,2,KJV,which in time past
14138,1PE,2,KJV,were
14139,1PE,2,KJV,not a people but
14140,1PE,2,KJV,are
14141,1PE,2,KJV,now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy
14142,1PE,2,KJV,dearly beloved i beseech
14143,1PE,2,KJV,you
14144,1PE,2,KJV,as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul
14145,1PE,2,KJV,having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by
14146,1PE,2,KJV,your
14147,1PE,2,KJV,good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation
14148,1PE,2,KJV,submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king as supreme
14149,1PE,2,KJV,or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well
14150,1PE,2,KJV,for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
14151,1PE,2,KJV,as free and not using
14152,1PE,2,KJV,your
14153,1PE,2,KJV,liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god
14154,1PE,2,KJV,honour all
14155,1PE,2,KJV,men
14156,1PE,2,KJV,love the brotherhood fear god honour the king
14157,1PE,2,KJV,servants
14158,1PE,2,KJV,be
14159,1PE,2,KJV,subject to
14160,1PE,2,KJV,your
14161,1PE,2,KJV,masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward
14162,1PE,2,KJV,for this
14163,1PE,2,KJV,is
14164,1PE,2,KJV,thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully
14165,1PE,2,KJV,for what glory
14166,1PE,2,KJV,is it
14167,1PE,2,KJV,if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer
14168,1PE,2,KJV,for it
14169,1PE,2,KJV,ye take it patiently this
14170,1PE,2,KJV,is
14171,1PE,2,KJV,acceptable with god
14172,1PE,2,KJV,for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps
14173,1PE,2,KJV,who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
14174,1PE,2,KJV,who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed
14175,1PE,2,KJV,himself
14176,1PE,2,KJV,to him that judgeth righteously
14177,1PE,2,KJV,who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed
14178,1PE,2,KJV,for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls
14179,1PE,3,KJV,likewise ye wives
14180,1PE,3,KJV,be
14181,1PE,3,KJV,in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives
14182,1PE,3,KJV,while they behold your chaste conversation
14183,1PE,3,KJV,coupled
14184,1PE,3,KJV,with fear
14185,1PE,3,KJV,whose adorning let it not be that outward
14186,1PE,3,KJV,adorning
14187,1PE,3,KJV,of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel
14188,1PE,3,KJV,but
14189,1PE,3,KJV,let it be
14190,1PE,3,KJV,the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible
14191,1PE,3,KJV,even the ornament
14192,1PE,3,KJV,of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price
14193,1PE,3,KJV,for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands
14194,1PE,3,KJV,even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement
14195,1PE,3,KJV,likewise ye husbands dwell with
14196,1PE,3,KJV,them
14197,1PE,3,KJV,according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered
14198,1PE,3,KJV,finally
14199,1PE,3,KJV,be ye
14200,1PE,3,KJV,all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren
14201,1PE,3,KJV,be
14202,1PE,3,KJV,pitiful
14203,1PE,3,KJV,be
14204,1PE,3,KJV,courteous
14205,1PE,3,KJV,not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing
14206,1PE,3,KJV,for
14207,1PE,3,KJV,he that will love life
14208,1PE,3,KJV,and see good days
14209,1PE,3,KJV,let him refrain his tongue from evil
14210,1PE,3,KJV,and his lips that they speak no guile
14211,1PE,3,KJV,let him eschew evil and do good
14212,1PE,3,KJV,let him seek peace and ensue it
14213,1PE,3,KJV,for the eyes of the lord
14214,1PE,3,KJV,are
14215,1PE,3,KJV,over the righteous
14216,1PE,3,KJV,and his ears
14217,1PE,3,KJV,are open
14218,1PE,3,KJV,unto their prayers
14219,1PE,3,KJV,but the face of the lord
14220,1PE,3,KJV,is
14221,1PE,3,KJV,against them that do evil
14222,1PE,3,KJV,and who
14223,1PE,3,KJV,is
14224,1PE,3,KJV,he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good
14225,1PE,3,KJV,but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy
14226,1PE,3,KJV,are ye
14227,1PE,3,KJV,and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled
14228,1PE,3,KJV,but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and
14229,1PE,3,KJV,be
14230,1PE,3,KJV,ready always to
14231,1PE,3,KJV,give
14232,1PE,3,KJV,an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
14233,1PE,3,KJV,having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ
14234,1PE,3,KJV,for
14235,1PE,3,KJV,it is
14236,1PE,3,KJV,better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing
14237,1PE,3,KJV,for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
14238,1PE,3,KJV,by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison
14239,1PE,3,KJV,which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water
14240,1PE,3,KJV,the like figure whereunto
14241,1PE,3,KJV,even
14242,1PE,3,KJV,baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ
14243,1PE,3,KJV,who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
14244,1PE,4,KJV,forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin
14245,1PE,4,KJV,that he no longer should live the rest of
14246,1PE,4,KJV,his
14247,1PE,4,KJV,time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god
14248,1PE,4,KJV,for the time past of
14249,1PE,4,KJV,our
14250,1PE,4,KJV,life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries
14251,1PE,4,KJV,wherein they think it strange that ye run not with
14252,1PE,4,KJV,them
14253,1PE,4,KJV,to the same excess of riot speaking evil of
14254,1PE,4,KJV,you
14255,1PE,4,KJV,
14256,1PE,4,KJV,who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
14257,1PE,4,KJV,for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit
14258,1PE,4,KJV,but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer
14259,1PE,4,KJV,and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
14260,1PE,4,KJV,use hospitality one to another without grudging
14261,1PE,4,KJV,as every man hath received the gift
14262,1PE,4,KJV,even so
14263,1PE,4,KJV,minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
14264,1PE,4,KJV,if any man speak
14265,1PE,4,KJV,let him speak
14266,1PE,4,KJV,as the oracles of god if any man minister
14267,1PE,4,KJV,let him do it
14268,1PE,4,KJV,as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen
14269,1PE,4,KJV,beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you
14270,1PE,4,KJV,but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy
14271,1PE,4,KJV,if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy
14272,1PE,4,KJV,are ye
14273,1PE,4,KJV,for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified
14274,1PE,4,KJV,but let none of you suffer as a murderer or
14275,1PE,4,KJV,as
14276,1PE,4,KJV,a thief or
14277,1PE,4,KJV,as
14278,1PE,4,KJV,an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters
14279,1PE,4,KJV,yet if
14280,1PE,4,KJV,any man suffer
14281,1PE,4,KJV,as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf
14282,1PE,4,KJV,for the time
14283,1PE,4,KJV,is come
14284,1PE,4,KJV,that judgment must begin at the house of god and if
14285,1PE,4,KJV,it
14286,1PE,4,KJV,first
14287,1PE,4,KJV,begin
14288,1PE,4,KJV,at us what shall the end
14289,1PE,4,KJV,be
14290,1PE,4,KJV,of them that obey not the gospel of god
14291,1PE,4,KJV,and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear
14292,1PE,4,KJV,wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls
14293,1PE,4,KJV,to him
14294,1PE,4,KJV,in well doing as unto a faithful creator
14295,1PE,5,KJV,the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed
14296,1PE,5,KJV,feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight
14297,1PE,5,KJV,thereof
14298,1PE,5,KJV,not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind
14299,1PE,5,KJV,neither as being lords over
14300,1PE,5,KJV,gods
14301,1PE,5,KJV,heritage but being ensamples to the flock
14302,1PE,5,KJV,and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away
14303,1PE,5,KJV,likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all
14304,1PE,5,KJV,of you
14305,1PE,5,KJV,be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble
14306,1PE,5,KJV,humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time
14307,1PE,5,KJV,casting all your care upon him for he careth for you
14308,1PE,5,KJV,be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
14309,1PE,5,KJV,whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
14310,1PE,5,KJV,but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle
14311,1PE,5,KJV,you
14312,1PE,5,KJV,
14313,1PE,5,KJV,to him
14314,1PE,5,KJV,be
14315,1PE,5,KJV,glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
14316,1PE,5,KJV,by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand
14317,1PE,5,KJV,the
14318,1PE,5,KJV,church that is
14319,1PE,5,KJV,at babylon elected together with
14320,1PE,5,KJV,you
14321,1PE,5,KJV,saluteth you and
14322,1PE,5,KJV,so doth
14323,1PE,5,KJV,marcus my son
14324,1PE,5,KJV,greet ye one another with a kiss of charity
14325,1PE,5,KJV,peace
14326,1PE,5,KJV,be
14327,1PE,5,KJV,with you all that are in christ jesus amen
14328,2PE,1,KJV,simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ
14329,2PE,1,KJV,grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
14330,2PE,1,KJV,according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
14331,2PE,1,KJV,pertain
14332,2PE,1,KJV,unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue
14333,2PE,1,KJV,whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
14334,2PE,1,KJV,and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge
14335,2PE,1,KJV,and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness
14336,2PE,1,KJV,and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity
14337,2PE,1,KJV,for if these things be in you and abound they make
14338,2PE,1,KJV,you that ye shall
14339,2PE,1,KJV,neither
14340,2PE,1,KJV,be
14341,2PE,1,KJV,barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
14342,2PE,1,KJV,but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
14343,2PE,1,KJV,wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall
14344,2PE,1,KJV,for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
14345,2PE,1,KJV,wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know
14346,2PE,1,KJV,them
14347,2PE,1,KJV,and be established in the present truth
14348,2PE,1,KJV,yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting
14349,2PE,1,KJV,you
14350,2PE,1,KJV,in remembrance
14351,2PE,1,KJV,knowing that shortly i must put off
14352,2PE,1,KJV,this
14353,2PE,1,KJV,my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me
14354,2PE,1,KJV,moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance
14355,2PE,1,KJV,for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
14356,2PE,1,KJV,for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
14357,2PE,1,KJV,and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount
14358,2PE,1,KJV,we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts
14359,2PE,1,KJV,knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
14360,2PE,1,KJV,for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake
14361,2PE,1,KJV,as they were
14362,2PE,1,KJV,moved by the holy ghost
14363,2PE,2,KJV,but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
14364,2PE,2,KJV,and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
14365,2PE,2,KJV,and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not
14366,2PE,2,KJV,for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast
14367,2PE,2,KJV,them
14368,2PE,2,KJV,down to hell and delivered
14369,2PE,2,KJV,them
14370,2PE,2,KJV,into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment
14371,2PE,2,KJV,and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth
14372,2PE,2,KJV,person
14373,2PE,2,KJV,a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly
14374,2PE,2,KJV,and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned
14375,2PE,2,KJV,them
14376,2PE,2,KJV,with an overthrow making
14377,2PE,2,KJV,them
14378,2PE,2,KJV,an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly
14379,2PE,2,KJV,and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked
14380,2PE,2,KJV,for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed
14381,2PE,2,KJV,his
14382,2PE,2,KJV,righteous soul from day to day with
14383,2PE,2,KJV,their
14384,2PE,2,KJV,unlawful deeds
14385,2PE,2,KJV,the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
14386,2PE,2,KJV,but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous
14387,2PE,2,KJV,are they
14388,2PE,2,KJV,selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities
14389,2PE,2,KJV,whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord
14390,2PE,2,KJV,but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption
14391,2PE,2,KJV,and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness
14392,2PE,2,KJV,as
14393,2PE,2,KJV,they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime spots
14394,2PE,2,KJV,they are
14395,2PE,2,KJV,and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you
14396,2PE,2,KJV,having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children
14397,2PE,2,KJV,which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam
14398,2PE,2,KJV,the son
14399,2PE,2,KJV,of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness
14400,2PE,2,KJV,but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet
14401,2PE,2,KJV,these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
14402,2PE,2,KJV,for when they speak great swelling
14403,2PE,2,KJV,words
14404,2PE,2,KJV,of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh
14405,2PE,2,KJV,through much
14406,2PE,2,KJV,wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
14407,2PE,2,KJV,while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage
14408,2PE,2,KJV,for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
14409,2PE,2,KJV,for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known
14410,2PE,2,KJV,it
14411,2PE,2,KJV,to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them
14412,2PE,2,KJV,but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog
14413,2PE,2,KJV,is
14414,2PE,2,KJV,turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire
14415,2PE,3,KJV,this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in
14416,2PE,3,KJV,both
14417,2PE,3,KJV,which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance
14418,2PE,3,KJV,that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour
14419,2PE,3,KJV,knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts
14420,2PE,3,KJV,and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as
14421,2PE,3,KJV,they were
14422,2PE,3,KJV,from the beginning of the creation
14423,2PE,3,KJV,for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water
14424,2PE,3,KJV,whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished
14425,2PE,3,KJV,but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
14426,2PE,3,KJV,but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day
14427,2PE,3,KJV,is
14428,2PE,3,KJV,with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
14429,2PE,3,KJV,the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
14430,2PE,3,KJV,but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up
14431,2PE,3,KJV,seeing
14432,2PE,3,KJV,then
14433,2PE,3,KJV,that
14434,2PE,3,KJV,all these things shall be dissolved what manner
14435,2PE,3,KJV,of persons
14436,2PE,3,KJV,ought ye to be in
14437,2PE,3,KJV,all
14438,2PE,3,KJV,holy conversation and godliness
14439,2PE,3,KJV,looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat
14440,2PE,3,KJV,nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
14441,2PE,3,KJV,wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
14442,2PE,3,KJV,and account
14443,2PE,3,KJV,that
14444,2PE,3,KJV,the longsuffering of our lord
14445,2PE,3,KJV,is
14446,2PE,3,KJV,salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you
14447,2PE,3,KJV,as also in all
14448,2PE,3,KJV,his
14449,2PE,3,KJV,epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as
14450,2PE,3,KJV,they do
14451,2PE,3,KJV,also the other scriptures unto their own destruction
14452,2PE,3,KJV,ye therefore beloved seeing ye know
14453,2PE,3,KJV,these things
14454,2PE,3,KJV,before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness
14455,2PE,3,KJV,but grow in grace and
14456,2PE,3,KJV,in
14457,2PE,3,KJV,the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ to him
14458,2PE,3,KJV,be
14459,2PE,3,KJV,glory both now and for ever amen
14460,1JN,1,KJV,that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life
14461,1JN,1,KJV,for the life was manifested and we have seen
14462,1JN,1,KJV,it
14463,1JN,1,KJV,and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us
14464,1JN,1,KJV,that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship
14465,1JN,1,KJV,is
14466,1JN,1,KJV,with the father and with his son jesus christ
14467,1JN,1,KJV,and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full
14468,1JN,1,KJV,this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all
14469,1JN,1,KJV,if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth
14470,1JN,1,KJV,but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
14471,1JN,1,KJV,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
14472,1JN,1,KJV,if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us
14473,1JN,1,KJV,our
14474,1JN,1,KJV,sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
14475,1JN,1,KJV,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
14476,1JN,2,KJV,my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
14477,1JN,2,KJV,and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for
14478,1JN,2,KJV,the sins of
14479,1JN,2,KJV,the whole world
14480,1JN,2,KJV,and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments
14481,1JN,2,KJV,he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
14482,1JN,2,KJV,but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
14483,1JN,2,KJV,he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked
14484,1JN,2,KJV,brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning
14485,1JN,2,KJV,again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth
14486,1JN,2,KJV,he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now
14487,1JN,2,KJV,he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him
14488,1JN,2,KJV,but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes
14489,1JN,2,KJV,i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake
14490,1JN,2,KJV,i write unto you fathers because ye have known him
14491,1JN,2,KJV,that is
14492,1JN,2,KJV,from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father
14493,1JN,2,KJV,i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him
14494,1JN,2,KJV,that is
14495,1JN,2,KJV,from the beginning i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one
14496,1JN,2,KJV,love not the world neither the things
14497,1JN,2,KJV,that are
14498,1JN,2,KJV,in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
14499,1JN,2,KJV,for all that
14500,1JN,2,KJV,is
14501,1JN,2,KJV,in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world
14502,1JN,2,KJV,and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
14503,1JN,2,KJV,little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time
14504,1JN,2,KJV,they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would
14505,1JN,2,KJV,no doubt
14506,1JN,2,KJV,have continued with us but
14507,1JN,2,KJV,they went out
14508,1JN,2,KJV,that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
14509,1JN,2,KJV,but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things
14510,1JN,2,KJV,i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth
14511,1JN,2,KJV,who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son
14512,1JN,2,KJV,whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father
14513,1JN,2,KJV,but he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also
14514,1JN,2,KJV,
14515,1JN,2,KJV,let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father
14516,1JN,2,KJV,and this is the promise that he hath promised us
14517,1JN,2,KJV,even
14518,1JN,2,KJV,eternal life
14519,1JN,2,KJV,these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you
14520,1JN,2,KJV,but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him
14521,1JN,2,KJV,and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming
14522,1JN,2,KJV,if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him
14523,1JN,3,KJV,behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not
14524,1JN,3,KJV,beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
14525,1JN,3,KJV,and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure
14526,1JN,3,KJV,whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law
14527,1JN,3,KJV,and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin
14528,1JN,3,KJV,whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
14529,1JN,3,KJV,little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous
14530,1JN,3,KJV,he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
14531,1JN,3,KJV,whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
14532,1JN,3,KJV,in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother
14533,1JN,3,KJV,for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another
14534,1JN,3,KJV,not as cain
14535,1JN,3,KJV,who
14536,1JN,3,KJV,was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous
14537,1JN,3,KJV,marvel not my brethren if the world hate you
14538,1JN,3,KJV,we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not
14539,1JN,3,KJV,his
14540,1JN,3,KJV,brother abideth in death
14541,1JN,3,KJV,whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
14542,1JN,3,KJV,hereby perceive we the love
14543,1JN,3,KJV,of god
14544,1JN,3,KJV,because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down
14545,1JN,3,KJV,our
14546,1JN,3,KJV,lives for the brethren
14547,1JN,3,KJV,but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels
14548,1JN,3,KJV,of compassion
14549,1JN,3,KJV,from him how dwelleth the love of god in him
14550,1JN,3,KJV,my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth
14551,1JN,3,KJV,and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him
14552,1JN,3,KJV,for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things
14553,1JN,3,KJV,beloved if our heart condemn us not
14554,1JN,3,KJV,then
14555,1JN,3,KJV,have we confidence toward god
14556,1JN,3,KJV,and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
14557,1JN,3,KJV,and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment
14558,1JN,3,KJV,and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us
14559,1JN,4,KJV,beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
14560,1JN,4,KJV,hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
14561,1JN,4,KJV,and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that
14562,1JN,4,KJV,spirit
14563,1JN,4,KJV,of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world
14564,1JN,4,KJV,ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world
14565,1JN,4,KJV,they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them
14566,1JN,4,KJV,we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
14567,1JN,4,KJV,beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god
14568,1JN,4,KJV,he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
14569,1JN,4,KJV,in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him
14570,1JN,4,KJV,herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son
14571,1JN,4,KJV,to be
14572,1JN,4,KJV,the propitiation for our sins
14573,1JN,4,KJV,beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another
14574,1JN,4,KJV,no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us
14575,1JN,4,KJV,hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit
14576,1JN,4,KJV,and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son
14577,1JN,4,KJV,to be
14578,1JN,4,KJV,the saviour of the world
14579,1JN,4,KJV,whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god
14580,1JN,4,KJV,and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him
14581,1JN,4,KJV,herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
14582,1JN,4,KJV,there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love
14583,1JN,4,KJV,we love him because he first loved us
14584,1JN,4,KJV,if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen
14585,1JN,4,KJV,and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also
14586,1JN,5,KJV,whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him
14587,1JN,5,KJV,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments
14588,1JN,5,KJV,for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous
14589,1JN,5,KJV,for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world
14590,1JN,5,KJV,even
14591,1JN,5,KJV,our faith
14592,1JN,5,KJV,who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
14593,1JN,5,KJV,this is he that came by water and blood
14594,1JN,5,KJV,even
14595,1JN,5,KJV,jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth
14596,1JN,5,KJV,for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
14597,1JN,5,KJV,and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one
14598,1JN,5,KJV,if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son
14599,1JN,5,KJV,he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son
14600,1JN,5,KJV,and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son
14601,1JN,5,KJV,he that hath the son hath life
14602,1JN,5,KJV,and
14603,1JN,5,KJV,he that hath not the son of god hath not life
14604,1JN,5,KJV,these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god
14605,1JN,5,KJV,and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us
14606,1JN,5,KJV,and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him
14607,1JN,5,KJV,if any man see his brother sin a sin
14608,1JN,5,KJV,which is
14609,1JN,5,KJV,not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it
14610,1JN,5,KJV,all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death
14611,1JN,5,KJV,we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not
14612,1JN,5,KJV,and
14613,1JN,5,KJV,we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness
14614,1JN,5,KJV,and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true
14615,1JN,5,KJV,even
14616,1JN,5,KJV,in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life
14617,1JN,5,KJV,little children keep yourselves from idols amen
14618,2JN,1,KJV,the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth
14619,2JN,1,KJV,for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever
14620,2JN,1,KJV,grace be with you mercy
14621,2JN,1,KJV,and
14622,2JN,1,KJV,peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love
14623,2JN,1,KJV,i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father
14624,2JN,1,KJV,and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another
14625,2JN,1,KJV,and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it
14626,2JN,1,KJV,for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist
14627,2JN,1,KJV,look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward
14628,2JN,1,KJV,whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son
14629,2JN,1,KJV,if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into
14630,2JN,1,KJV,your
14631,2JN,1,KJV,house neither bid him god speed
14632,2JN,1,KJV,for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds
14633,2JN,1,KJV,having many things to write unto you i would not
14634,2JN,1,KJV,write
14635,2JN,1,KJV,with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full
14636,2JN,1,KJV,the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen
14637,3JN,1,KJV,the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth
14638,3JN,1,KJV,beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth
14639,3JN,1,KJV,for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth
14640,3JN,1,KJV,i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
14641,3JN,1,KJV,beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers
14642,3JN,1,KJV,which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well
14643,3JN,1,KJV,because that for his names sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles
14644,3JN,1,KJV,we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth
14645,3JN,1,KJV,i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not
14646,3JN,1,KJV,wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth
14647,3JN,1,KJV,them
14648,3JN,1,KJV,out of the church
14649,3JN,1,KJV,beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god
14650,3JN,1,KJV,demetrius hath good report of all
14651,3JN,1,KJV,men
14652,3JN,1,KJV,and of the truth itself yea and we
14653,3JN,1,KJV,also
14654,3JN,1,KJV,bear record and ye know that our record is true
14655,3JN,1,KJV,i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee
14656,3JN,1,KJV,but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face peace
14657,3JN,1,KJV,be
14658,3JN,1,KJV,to thee
14659,3JN,1,KJV,our
14660,3JN,1,KJV,friends salute thee greet the friends by name
14661,JUD,1,KJV,jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ
14662,JUD,1,KJV,and
14663,JUD,1,KJV,called
14664,JUD,1,KJV,mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied
14665,JUD,1,KJV,beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort
14666,JUD,1,KJV,you
14667,JUD,1,KJV,that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints
14668,JUD,1,KJV,for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ
14669,JUD,1,KJV,i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not
14670,JUD,1,KJV,and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
14671,JUD,1,KJV,even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
14672,JUD,1,KJV,likewise also these
14673,JUD,1,KJV,filthy
14674,JUD,1,KJV,dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities
14675,JUD,1,KJV,yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee
14676,JUD,1,KJV,but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves
14677,JUD,1,KJV,woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core
14678,JUD,1,KJV,these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds
14679,JUD,1,KJV,they are
14680,JUD,1,KJV,without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots
14681,JUD,1,KJV,raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever
14682,JUD,1,KJV,and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints
14683,JUD,1,KJV,to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard
14684,JUD,1,KJV,speeches
14685,JUD,1,KJV,which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
14686,JUD,1,KJV,these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling
14687,JUD,1,KJV,words
14688,JUD,1,KJV,having mens persons in admiration because of advantage
14689,JUD,1,KJV,but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ
14690,JUD,1,KJV,how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts
14691,JUD,1,KJV,these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit
14692,JUD,1,KJV,but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost
14693,JUD,1,KJV,keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life
14694,JUD,1,KJV,and of some have compassion making a difference
14695,JUD,1,KJV,and others save with fear pulling
14696,JUD,1,KJV,them
14697,JUD,1,KJV,out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh
14698,JUD,1,KJV,now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present
14699,JUD,1,KJV,you
14700,JUD,1,KJV,faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy
14701,JUD,1,KJV,to the only wise god our saviour
14702,JUD,1,KJV,be
14703,JUD,1,KJV,glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen
14704,REV,1,KJV,the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified
14705,REV,1,KJV,it
14706,REV,1,KJV,by his angel unto his servant john
14707,REV,1,KJV,who bare record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw
14708,REV,1,KJV,blessed
14709,REV,1,KJV,is
14710,REV,1,KJV,he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time
14711,REV,1,KJV,is
14712,REV,1,KJV,at hand
14713,REV,1,KJV,john to the seven churches which are in asia grace
14714,REV,1,KJV,be
14715,REV,1,KJV,unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne
14716,REV,1,KJV,and from jesus christ
14717,REV,1,KJV,who is
14718,REV,1,KJV,the faithful witness
14719,REV,1,KJV,and
14720,REV,1,KJV,the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
14721,REV,1,KJV,and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him
14722,REV,1,KJV,be
14723,REV,1,KJV,glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
14724,REV,1,KJV,behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they
14725,REV,1,KJV,also
14726,REV,1,KJV,which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen
14727,REV,1,KJV,i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending
14728,REV,1,KJV,saith the lord
14729,REV,1,KJV,which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
14730,REV,1,KJV,i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
14731,REV,1,KJV,i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
14732,REV,1,KJV,saying
14733,REV,1,KJV,i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send
14734,REV,1,KJV,it
14735,REV,1,KJV,unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea
14736,REV,1,KJV,and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks
14737,REV,1,KJV,and in the midst of the seven candlesticks
14738,REV,1,KJV,one
14739,REV,1,KJV,like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle
14740,REV,1,KJV,his head and
14741,REV,1,KJV,his
14742,REV,1,KJV,hairs
14743,REV,1,KJV,were
14744,REV,1,KJV,white like wool as white as snow and his eyes
14745,REV,1,KJV,were
14746,REV,1,KJV,as a flame of fire
14747,REV,1,KJV,and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters
14748,REV,1,KJV,and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance
14749,REV,1,KJV,was
14750,REV,1,KJV,as the sun shineth in his strength
14751,REV,1,KJV,and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me
14752,REV,1,KJV,fear not i am the first and the last
14753,REV,1,KJV,i am
14754,REV,1,KJV,he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death
14755,REV,1,KJV,write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter
14756,REV,1,KJV,the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches
14757,REV,2,KJV,unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks
14758,REV,2,KJV,i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars
14759,REV,2,KJV,and hast borne and hast patience and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted
14760,REV,2,KJV,nevertheless i have
14761,REV,2,KJV,somewhat
14762,REV,2,KJV,against thee because thou hast left thy first love
14763,REV,2,KJV,remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent
14764,REV,2,KJV,but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitanes which i also hate
14765,REV,2,KJV,he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god
14766,REV,2,KJV,and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive
14767,REV,2,KJV,i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and
14768,REV,2,KJV,i know
14769,REV,2,KJV,the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but
14770,REV,2,KJV,are
14771,REV,2,KJV,the synagogue of satan
14772,REV,2,KJV,fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
14773,REV,2,KJV,some
14774,REV,2,KJV,of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life
14775,REV,2,KJV,he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death
14776,REV,2,KJV,and to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges
14777,REV,2,KJV,i know thy works and where thou dwellest
14778,REV,2,KJV,even
14779,REV,2,KJV,where satans seat
14780,REV,2,KJV,is
14781,REV,2,KJV,and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas
14782,REV,2,KJV,was
14783,REV,2,KJV,my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth
14784,REV,2,KJV,but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication
14785,REV,2,KJV,so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which thing i hate
14786,REV,2,KJV,repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth
14787,REV,2,KJV,he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
14788,REV,2,KJV,it
14789,REV,2,KJV,and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet
14790,REV,2,KJV,are
14791,REV,2,KJV,like fine brass
14792,REV,2,KJV,i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last
14793,REV,2,KJV,to be
14794,REV,2,KJV,more than the first
14795,REV,2,KJV,notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
14796,REV,2,KJV,and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not
14797,REV,2,KJV,behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds
14798,REV,2,KJV,and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works
14799,REV,2,KJV,but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden
14800,REV,2,KJV,but that which ye have
14801,REV,2,KJV,already
14802,REV,2,KJV,hold fast till i come
14803,REV,2,KJV,and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations
14804,REV,2,KJV,and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father
14805,REV,2,KJV,and i will give him the morning star
14806,REV,2,KJV,he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
14807,REV,3,KJV,and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead

14822,REV,3,KJV,my new name
14823,REV,3,KJV,he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches

14825,REV,3,KJV,i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot
14826,REV,3,KJV,so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth
14827,REV,3,KJV,because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked
14828,REV,3,KJV,i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and
14829,REV,3,KJV,that

14834,REV,3,KJV,he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
14835,REV,4,KJV,after this i looked and behold a door
14836,REV,4,KJV,was
14837,REV,4,KJV,opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard
14838,REV,4,KJV,was
14839,REV,4,KJV,as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said
14840,REV,4,KJV,come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter
14841,REV,4,KJV,and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and
14842,REV,4,KJV,one
14843,REV,4,KJV,sat on the throne
14844,REV,4,KJV,and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and
14845,REV,4,KJV,there was
14846,REV,4,KJV,a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald
14847,REV,4,KJV,and round about the throne
14848,REV,4,KJV,were
14849,REV,4,KJV,four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold
14850,REV,4,KJV,and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and
14851,REV,4,KJV,there were
14852,REV,4,KJV,seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god
14853,REV,4,KJV,and before the throne
14854,REV,4,KJV,there was
14855,REV,4,KJV,a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne
14856,REV,4,KJV,were
14857,REV,4,KJV,four beasts full of eyes before and behind
14858,REV,4,KJV,and the first beast
14859,REV,4,KJV,was
14860,REV,4,KJV,like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast
14861,REV,4,KJV,was
14862,REV,4,KJV,like a flying eagle
14863,REV,4,KJV,and the four beasts had each of them six wings about
14864,REV,4,KJV,him
14865,REV,4,KJV,and
14866,REV,4,KJV,they were
14867,REV,4,KJV,full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come
14868,REV,4,KJV,and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever
14869,REV,4,KJV,the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying
14870,REV,4,KJV,thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created
14871,REV,5,KJV,and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals
14872,REV,5,KJV,and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof
14873,REV,5,KJV,and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon
14874,REV,5,KJV,and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon
14875,REV,5,KJV,and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof
14876,REV,5,KJV,and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth
14877,REV,5,KJV,and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne
14878,REV,5,KJV,and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four
14879,REV,5,KJV,and
14880,REV,5,KJV,twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints
14881,REV,5,KJV,and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation
14882,REV,5,KJV,and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth
14883,REV,5,KJV,and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
14884,REV,5,KJV,saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing
14885,REV,5,KJV,and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power
14886,REV,5,KJV,be
14887,REV,5,KJV,unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever
14888,REV,5,KJV,and the four beasts said amen and the four
14889,REV,5,KJV,and
14890,REV,5,KJV,twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever
14891,REV,6,KJV,and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see
14892,REV,6,KJV,and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer
14893,REV,6,KJV,and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see
14894,REV,6,KJV,and there went out another horse
14895,REV,6,KJV,that was
14896,REV,6,KJV,red and
14897,REV,6,KJV,power
14898,REV,6,KJV,was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword
14899,REV,6,KJV,and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand
14900,REV,6,KJV,and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and
14901,REV,6,KJV,see
14902,REV,6,KJV,thou hurt not the oil and the wine
14903,REV,6,KJV,and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see
14904,REV,6,KJV,and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth
14905,REV,6,KJV,and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held
14906,REV,6,KJV,and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth
14907,REV,6,KJV,and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they
14908,REV,6,KJV,were
14909,REV,6,KJV,should be fulfilled
14910,REV,6,KJV,and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood
14911,REV,6,KJV,and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind
14912,REV,6,KJV,and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places
14913,REV,6,KJV,and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains
14914,REV,6,KJV,and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb
14915,REV,6,KJV,for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand
14916,REV,7,KJV,and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree
14917,REV,7,KJV,and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea
14918,REV,7,KJV,saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads
14919,REV,7,KJV,and i heard the number of them which were sealed
14920,REV,7,KJV,and there were
14921,REV,7,KJV,sealed an hundred
14922,REV,7,KJV,and
14923,REV,7,KJV,forty
14924,REV,7,KJV,and
14925,REV,7,KJV,four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel
14926,REV,7,KJV,of the tribe of juda
14927,REV,7,KJV,were
14928,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben
14929,REV,7,KJV,were
14930,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad
14931,REV,7,KJV,were
14932,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand
14933,REV,7,KJV,of the tribe of aser
14934,REV,7,KJV,were
14935,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of nepthalim
14936,REV,7,KJV,were
14937,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses
14938,REV,7,KJV,were
14939,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand
14940,REV,7,KJV,of the tribe of simeon
14941,REV,7,KJV,were
14942,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of levi
14943,REV,7,KJV,were
14944,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar
14945,REV,7,KJV,were
14946,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand
14947,REV,7,KJV,of the tribe of zabulon
14948,REV,7,KJV,were
14949,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph
14950,REV,7,KJV,were
14951,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin
14952,REV,7,KJV,were
14953,REV,7,KJV,sealed twelve thousand
14954,REV,7,KJV,after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands
14955,REV,7,KJV,and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb
14956,REV,7,KJV,and all the angels stood round about the throne and
14957,REV,7,KJV,about
14958,REV,7,KJV,the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god
14959,REV,7,KJV,saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might
14960,REV,7,KJV,be
14961,REV,7,KJV,unto our god for ever and ever amen
14962,REV,7,KJV,and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they
14963,REV,7,KJV,and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
14964,REV,7,KJV,therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them
14965,REV,7,KJV,they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat
14966,REV,7,KJV,for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
14967,REV,8,KJV,and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour
14968,REV,8,KJV,and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets
14969,REV,8,KJV,and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer
14970,REV,8,KJV,it
14971,REV,8,KJV,with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne
14972,REV,8,KJV,and the smoke of the incense
14973,REV,8,KJV,which came
14974,REV,8,KJV,with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angels hand
14975,REV,8,KJV,and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast
14976,REV,8,KJV,it
14977,REV,8,KJV,into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake
14978,REV,8,KJV,and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound
14979,REV,8,KJV,the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up
14980,REV,8,KJV,and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood
14981,REV,8,KJV,and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed
14982,REV,8,KJV,and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters
14983,REV,8,KJV,and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter
14984,REV,8,KJV,and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise
14985,REV,8,KJV,and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound
14986,REV,9,KJV,and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit
14987,REV,9,KJV,and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
14988,REV,9,KJV,and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power
14989,REV,9,KJV,and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads
14990,REV,9,KJV,and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment
14991,REV,9,KJV,was
14992,REV,9,KJV,as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man
14993,REV,9,KJV,and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them
14994,REV,9,KJV,and the shapes of the locusts
14995,REV,9,KJV,were
14996,REV,9,KJV,like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads
14997,REV,9,KJV,were
14998,REV,9,KJV,as it were crowns like gold and their faces
14999,REV,9,KJV,were
15000,REV,9,KJV,as the faces of men
15001,REV,9,KJV,and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as
15002,REV,9,KJV,the teeth
15003,REV,9,KJV,of lions
15004,REV,9,KJV,and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings
15005,REV,9,KJV,was
15006,REV,9,KJV,as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle
15007,REV,9,KJV,and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power
15008,REV,9,KJV,was
15009,REV,9,KJV,to hurt men five months
15010,REV,9,KJV,and they had a king over them
15011,REV,9,KJV,which is
15012,REV,9,KJV,the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue
15013,REV,9,KJV,is
15014,REV,9,KJV,abaddon but in the greek tongue hath
15015,REV,9,KJV,his
15016,REV,9,KJV,name apollyon
15017,REV,9,KJV,one woe is past
15018,REV,9,KJV,and
15019,REV,9,KJV,behold there come two woes more hereafter
15020,REV,9,KJV,and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god
15021,REV,9,KJV,saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates
15022,REV,9,KJV,and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men
15023,REV,9,KJV,and the number of the army of the horsemen
15024,REV,9,KJV,were
15025,REV,9,KJV,two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them
15026,REV,9,KJV,and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses
15027,REV,9,KJV,were
15028,REV,9,KJV,as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone
15029,REV,9,KJV,by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths
15030,REV,9,KJV,for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails
15031,REV,9,KJV,were
15032,REV,9,KJV,like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt
15033,REV,9,KJV,and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk
15034,REV,9,KJV,neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts
15035,REV,10,KJV,and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow
15036,REV,10,KJV,was
15037,REV,10,KJV,upon his head and his face
15038,REV,10,KJV,was
15039,REV,10,KJV,as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire
15040,REV,10,KJV,and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and
15041,REV,10,KJV,his
15042,REV,10,KJV,left
15043,REV,10,KJV,foot
15044,REV,10,KJV,on the earth
15045,REV,10,KJV,and cried with a loud voice as
15046,REV,10,KJV,when
15047,REV,10,KJV,a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices
15048,REV,10,KJV,and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not
15049,REV,10,KJV,and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven
15050,REV,10,KJV,and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer
15051,REV,10,KJV,but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
15052,REV,10,KJV,and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go
15053,REV,10,KJV,and
15054,REV,10,KJV,take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
15055,REV,10,KJV,and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take
15056,REV,10,KJV,it
15057,REV,10,KJV,and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
15058,REV,10,KJV,and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter
15059,REV,10,KJV,and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings
15060,REV,11,KJV,and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein
15061,REV,11,KJV,but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty
15062,REV,11,KJV,and
15063,REV,11,KJV,two months
15064,REV,11,KJV,and i will give
15065,REV,11,KJV,power
15066,REV,11,KJV,unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred
15067,REV,11,KJV,and
15068,REV,11,KJV,threescore days clothed in sackcloth
15069,REV,11,KJV,these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth
15070,REV,11,KJV,and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed
15071,REV,11,KJV,these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will
15072,REV,11,KJV,and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them
15073,REV,11,KJV,and their dead bodies

15181,REV,14,KJV,it
15182,REV,14,KJV,into the great winepress of the wrath of god
15183,REV,14,KJV,and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand
15184,REV,14,KJV,and
15185,REV,14,KJV,six hundred furlongs
15186,REV,15,KJV,and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god
15187,REV,15,KJV,and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark

15198,REV,15,KJV,art
15199,REV,15,KJV,holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest
15200,REV,15,KJV,and after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
15201,REV,15,KJV,and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles
15202,REV,15,KJV,and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever
15203,REV,15,KJV,and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled
15204,REV,16,KJV,and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth
15205,REV,16,KJV,and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and
15206,REV,16,KJV,upon
15207,REV,16,KJV,them which worshipped his image
15208,REV,16,KJV,and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead
15209,REV,16,KJV,man
15210,REV,16,KJV,and every living soul died in the sea
15211,REV,16,KJV,and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood
15212,REV,16,KJV,and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus
15213,REV,16,KJV,for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy
15214,REV,16,KJV,and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous
15215,REV,16,KJV,are
15216,REV,16,KJV,thy judgments
15217,REV,16,KJV,and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire
15218,REV,16,KJV,and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory
15219,REV,16,KJV,and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain
15220,REV,16,KJV,and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds
15221,REV,16,KJV,and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared
15222,REV,16,KJV,and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs
15223,REV,16,KJV,come
15224,REV,16,KJV,out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet
15225,REV,16,KJV,for they are the spirits of devils working miracles
15226,REV,16,KJV,which
15227,REV,16,KJV,go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
15228,REV,16,KJV,behold i come as a thief blessed
15229,REV,16,KJV,is
15230,REV,16,KJV,he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame
15231,REV,16,KJV,and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon
15232,REV,16,KJV,and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done
15233,REV,16,KJV,and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake
15234,REV,16,KJV,and
15235,REV,16,KJV,so great
15236,REV,16,KJV,and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath
15237,REV,16,KJV,and every island fled away and the mountains were not found
15238,REV,16,KJV,and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven
15239,REV,16,KJV,every stone
15240,REV,16,KJV,about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great
15241,REV,17,KJV,and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
15242,REV,17,KJV,with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication
15243,REV,17,KJV,so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
15244,REV,17,KJV,and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
15245,REV,17,KJV,and upon her forehead
15246,REV,17,KJV,was
15247,REV,17,KJV,a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth
15248,REV,17,KJV,and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration
15249,REV,17,KJV,and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns
15250,REV,17,KJV,the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is
15251,REV,17,KJV,and here
15252,REV,17,KJV,is
15253,REV,17,KJV,the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth
15254,REV,17,KJV,and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is
15255,REV,17,KJV,and
15256,REV,17,KJV,the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space
15257,REV,17,KJV,and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition
15258,REV,17,KJV,and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beast
15259,REV,17,KJV,these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast
15260,REV,17,KJV,these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him
15261,REV,17,KJV,are
15262,REV,17,KJV,called and chosen and faithful
15263,REV,17,KJV,and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues
15264,REV,17,KJV,and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire
15265,REV,17,KJV,for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled
15266,REV,17,KJV,and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth
15267,REV,18,KJV,and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory
15268,REV,18,KJV,and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird
15269,REV,18,KJV,for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies
15270,REV,18,KJV,and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues
15271,REV,18,KJV,for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities
15272,REV,18,KJV,reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double
15273,REV,18,KJV,how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow
15274,REV,18,KJV,therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong
15275,REV,18,KJV,is
15276,REV,18,KJV,the lord god who judgeth her
15277,REV,18,KJV,and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning
15278,REV,18,KJV,standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come
15279,REV,18,KJV,and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any more
15280,REV,18,KJV,the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble
15281,REV,18,KJV,and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men
15282,REV,18,KJV,and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all
15283,REV,18,KJV,the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing
15284,REV,18,KJV,and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls
15285,REV,18,KJV,for in one hour so great riches is come to nought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off
15286,REV,18,KJV,and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what
15287,REV,18,KJV,city is
15288,REV,18,KJV,like unto this great city
15289,REV,18,KJV,and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate
15290,REV,18,KJV,rejoice over her
15291,REV,18,KJV,thou
15292,REV,18,KJV,heaven and
15293,REV,18,KJV,ye
15294,REV,18,KJV,holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged you on her
15295,REV,18,KJV,and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast
15296,REV,18,KJV,it
15297,REV,18,KJV,into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all
15298,REV,18,KJV,and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft
15299,REV,18,KJV,he be
15300,REV,18,KJV,shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee
15301,REV,18,KJV,and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived
15302,REV,18,KJV,and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth
15303,REV,19,KJV,and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god
15304,REV,19,KJV,for true and righteous
15305,REV,19,KJV,are
15306,REV,19,KJV,his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand
15307,REV,19,KJV,and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever
