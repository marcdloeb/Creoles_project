4,MAT,1,NRSV,so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david to the deportation to babylon fourteen generations and from the deportation to babylon to the messiah fourteen generations
5,MAT,1,NRSV,now the birth of jesus the messiah took place in this way
6,MAT,1,NRSV,when his mother mary had been engaged to joseph but before they lived together she was found to be with child from the holy spirit
7,MAT,1,NRSV,her husband joseph being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace planned to dismiss her quietly
8,MAT,1,NRSV,but just when he had resolved to do this an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream and said joseph son of david do not be afraid to take mary as your wife for the child conceived in her is from the holy spirit
9,MAT,1,NRSV,she will bear a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins
10,MAT,1,NRSV,all this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet look the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall name him emmanuel which means god is with us
11,MAT,1,NRSV,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son and he named him jesus
12,MAT,2,NRSV,in the time of king herod after jesus was born in bethlehem of judea wise men from the east came to jerusalem asking where is the child who has been born king of the jews
13,MAT,2,NRSV,for we observed his star at its rising and have come to pay him homage
14,MAT,2,NRSV,when king herod heard this he was frightened and all jerusalem with him and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the messiah was to be born
15,MAT,2,NRSV,they told him in bethlehem of judea for so it has been written by the prophet and you bethlehem in the land of judah are by no means least among the rulers of judah for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people israel
16,MAT,2,NRSV,then herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared
17,MAT,2,NRSV,then he sent them to bethlehem saying go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word so that i may also go and pay him homage
18,MAT,2,NRSV,when they had heard the king they set out and there ahead of them went the star that they had seen at its rising until it stopped over the place where the child was
19,MAT,2,NRSV,when they saw that the star had stopped they were overwhelmed with joy
20,MAT,2,NRSV,on entering the house they saw the child with mary his mother and they knelt down and paid him homage
21,MAT,2,NRSV,then opening their treasure chests they offered him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
22,MAT,2,NRSV,and having been warned in a dream not to return to herod they left for their own country by another road
23,MAT,2,NRSV,now after they had left an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream and said get up take the child and his mother and flee to egypt and remain there until i tell you for herod is about to search for the child to destroy him
24,MAT,2,NRSV,then joseph got up took the child and his mother by night and went to egypt and remained there until the death of herod
25,MAT,2,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet out of egypt i have called my son
26,MAT,2,NRSV,when herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men he was infuriated and he sent and killed all the children in and around bethlehem who were two years old or under according to the time that he had learned from the wise men
27,MAT,2,NRSV,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they are no more
28,MAT,2,NRSV,when herod died an angel of the lord suddenly appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt and said get up take the child and his mother and go to the land of israel for those who were seeking the childs life are dead
29,MAT,2,NRSV,then joseph got up took the child and his mother and went to the land of israel
30,MAT,2,NRSV,but when he heard that archelaus was ruling over judea in place of his father herod he was afraid to go there
31,MAT,2,NRSV,and after being warned in a dream he went away to the district of galilee
32,MAT,2,NRSV,there he made his home in a town called nazareth so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled he will be called a nazorean
33,MAT,3,NRSV,in those days john the baptist appeared in the wilderness of judea proclaiming repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near
34,MAT,3,NRSV,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight
35,MAT,3,NRSV,now john wore clothing of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and his food was locusts and wild honey
36,MAT,3,NRSV,then the people of jerusalem and all judea were going out to him and all the region along the jordan and they were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins
37,MAT,3,NRSV,but when he saw many pharisees and sadducees coming for baptism he said to them you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come
38,MAT,3,NRSV,bear fruit worthy of repentance
39,MAT,3,NRSV,do not presume to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham
40,MAT,3,NRSV,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
41,MAT,3,NRSV,i baptize you with water for repentance but one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to carry his sandals
42,MAT,3,NRSV,he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire
43,MAT,3,NRSV,his winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire
44,MAT,3,NRSV,then jesus came from galilee to john at the jordan to be baptized by him
45,MAT,3,NRSV,john would have prevented him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me
46,MAT,3,NRSV,but jesus answered him let it be so now for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness
47,MAT,3,NRSV,then he consented
48,MAT,3,NRSV,and when jesus had been baptized just as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him
49,MAT,3,NRSV,and a voice from heaven said this is my son the beloved with whom i am well pleased
50,MAT,4,NRSV,then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
51,MAT,4,NRSV,he fasted forty days and forty nights and afterwards he was famished
52,MAT,4,NRSV,the tempter came and said to him if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread
53,MAT,4,NRSV,but he answered it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god
54,MAT,4,NRSV,then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels concerning you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone
55,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus said to him again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test
56,MAT,4,NRSV,again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor and he said to him all these i will give you if you will fall down and worship me
57,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus said to him away with you satan for it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him
58,MAT,4,NRSV,then the devil left him and suddenly angels came and waited on him
59,MAT,4,NRSV,now when jesus heard that john had been arrested he withdrew to galilee
60,MAT,4,NRSV,he left nazareth and made his home in capernaum by the sea in the territory of zebulun and naphtali so that what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah might be fulfilled land of zebulun land of naphtali on the road by the sea across the jordan galilee of the gentiles the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned
61,MAT,4,NRSV,from that time jesus began to proclaim repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near
62,MAT,4,NRSV,as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the seafor they were fishermen
63,MAT,4,NRSV,and he said to them follow me and i will make you fish for people
64,MAT,4,NRSV,immediately they left their nets and followed him
65,MAT,4,NRSV,as he went from there he saw two other brothers james son of zebedee and his brother john in the boat with their father zebedee mending their nets and he called them
66,MAT,4,NRSV,immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him
67,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people
68,MAT,4,NRSV,so his fame spread throughout all syria and they brought to him all the sick those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains demoniacs epileptics and paralytics and he cured them
69,MAT,4,NRSV,and great crowds followed him from galilee the decapolis jerusalem judea and from beyond the jordan
70,MAT,5,NRSV,when jesus saw the crowds he went up the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him
71,MAT,5,NRSV,then he began to speak and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
72,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted
73,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth
74,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
75,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the merciful for they will receive mercy
76,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the pure in heart for they will see god
77,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god
78,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
79,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account
80,MAT,5,NRSV,rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you
81,MAT,5,NRSV,you are the salt of the earth but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored
82,MAT,5,NRSV,it is no longer good for anything but is thrown out and trampled under foot
83,MAT,5,NRSV,you are the light of the world
84,MAT,5,NRSV,a city built on a hill cannot be hid
85,MAT,5,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket but on the lampstand and it gives light to all in the house
86,MAT,5,NRSV,in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven
87,MAT,5,NRSV,do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have come not to abolish but to fulfill
88,MAT,5,NRSV,for truly i tell you until heaven and earth pass away not one letter not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished
89,MAT,5,NRSV,therefore whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven
90,MAT,5,NRSV,for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
91,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment
92,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister you will be liable to judgment and if you insult a brother or sister you will be liable to the council and if you say you fool you will be liable to the hell of fire
93,MAT,5,NRSV,so when you are offering your gift at the altar if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you leave your gift there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother or sister and then come and offer your gift
94,MAT,5,NRSV,come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him or your accuser may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you will be thrown into prison
95,MAT,5,NRSV,truly i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the last penny
96,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery
97,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart
98,MAT,5,NRSV,if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell
99,MAT,5,NRSV,and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell
100,MAT,5,NRSV,it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce
101,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
102,MAT,5,NRSV,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord
103,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
104,MAT,5,NRSV,and do not swear by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black
105,MAT,5,NRSV,let your word be yes yes or no no anything more than this comes from the evil one
106,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
107,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you do not resist an evildoer
108,MAT,5,NRSV,but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat give your cloak as well and if anyone forces you to go one mile go also the second mile
109,MAT,5,NRSV,give to everyone who begs from you and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you
110,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy
111,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be children of your father in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous
112,MAT,5,NRSV,for if you love those who love you what reward do you have
113,MAT,5,NRSV,do not even the tax collectors do the same
114,MAT,5,NRSV,and if you greet only your brothers and sisters what more are you doing than others
115,MAT,5,NRSV,do not even the gentiles do the same
116,MAT,5,NRSV,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect
117,MAT,6,NRSV,beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them for then you have no reward from your father in heaven
118,MAT,6,NRSV,so whenever you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be praised by others
119,MAT,6,NRSV,truly i tell you they have received their reward
120,MAT,6,NRSV,but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your alms may be done in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
121,MAT,6,NRSV,and whenever you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners so that they may be seen by others
122,MAT,6,NRSV,truly i tell you they have received their reward
123,MAT,6,NRSV,but whenever you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
124,MAT,6,NRSV,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words
125,MAT,6,NRSV,do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him
126,MAT,6,NRSV,pray then in this way our father in heaven hallowed be your name
127,MAT,6,NRSV,your kingdom come
128,MAT,6,NRSV,your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
129,MAT,6,NRSV,give us this day our daily bread
130,MAT,6,NRSV,and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
131,MAT,6,NRSV,and do not bring us to the time of trial but rescue us from the evil one
132,MAT,6,NRSV,for if you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive others neither will your father forgive your trespasses
133,MAT,6,NRSV,and whenever you fast do not look dismal like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting
134,MAT,6,NRSV,truly i tell you they have received their reward
135,MAT,6,NRSV,but when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
136,MAT,6,NRSV,do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal
137,MAT,6,NRSV,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
138,MAT,6,NRSV,the eye is the lamp of the body
139,MAT,6,NRSV,so if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light but if your eye is unhealthy your whole body will be full of darkness
140,MAT,6,NRSV,if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other
141,MAT,6,NRSV,you cannot serve god and wealth
142,MAT,6,NRSV,therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will wear
143,MAT,6,NRSV,is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
144,MAT,6,NRSV,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them
145,MAT,6,NRSV,are you not of more value than they
146,MAT,6,NRSV,and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life
147,MAT,6,NRSV,and why do you worry about clothing
148,MAT,6,NRSV,consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
149,MAT,6,NRSV,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe youyou of little faith
150,MAT,6,NRSV,therefore do not worry saying what will we eat
151,MAT,6,NRSV,or what will we drink
152,MAT,6,NRSV,or what will we wear
153,MAT,6,NRSV,for it is the gentiles who strive for all these things and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things
154,MAT,6,NRSV,but strive first for the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well
155,MAT,6,NRSV,so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring worries of its own
156,MAT,6,NRSV,todays trouble is enough for today
157,MAT,7,NRSV,do not judge so that you may not be judged
158,MAT,7,NRSV,for with the judgment you make you will be judged and the measure you give will be the measure you get
159,MAT,7,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye
160,MAT,7,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor let me take the speck out of your eye while the log is in your own eye
161,MAT,7,NRSV,you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors eye
162,MAT,7,NRSV,do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you
163,MAT,7,NRSV,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you
164,MAT,7,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened
165,MAT,7,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone
166,MAT,7,NRSV,or if the child asks for a fish will give a snake
167,MAT,7,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him in everything do to others as you would have them do to you for this is the law and the prophets
168,MAT,7,NRSV,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction and there are many who take it
169,MAT,7,NRSV,for the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life and there are few who find it
170,MAT,7,NRSV,beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
171,MAT,7,NRSV,you will know them by their fruits
172,MAT,7,NRSV,are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles
173,MAT,7,NRSV,in the same way every good tree bears good fruit but the bad tree bears bad fruit
174,MAT,7,NRSV,a good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit
175,MAT,7,NRSV,every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
176,MAT,7,NRSV,thus you will know them by their fruits
177,MAT,7,NRSV,not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will of my father in heaven
178,MAT,7,NRSV,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name
179,MAT,7,NRSV,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers
180,MAT,7,NRSV,everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock
181,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on rock
182,MAT,7,NRSV,and everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand
183,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it felland great was its fall now when jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as their scribes
184,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him saying lord if you choose you can make me clean
185,MAT,8,NRSV,he stretched out his hand and touched him saying i do choose
186,MAT,8,NRSV,be made clean immediately his leprosy was cleansed
187,MAT,8,NRSV,then jesus said to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded as a testimony to them
188,MAT,8,NRSV,when he entered capernaum a centurion came to him appealing to him and saying lord my servant is lying at home paralyzed in terrible distress
189,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to him i will come and cure him
190,MAT,8,NRSV,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed
191,MAT,8,NRSV,for i also am a man under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it
192,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus heard him he was amazed and said to those who followed him truly i tell you in no one in israel have i found such faith
193,MAT,8,NRSV,i tell you many will come from east and west and will eat with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
194,MAT,8,NRSV,and to the centurion jesus said go let it be done for you according to your faith
195,MAT,8,NRSV,and the servant was healed in that hour
196,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus entered peters house he saw his motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to serve him
197,MAT,8,NRSV,that evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and cured all who were sick
198,MAT,8,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases
199,MAT,8,NRSV,now when jesus saw great crowds around him he gave orders to go over to the other side
200,MAT,8,NRSV,a scribe then approached and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go
201,MAT,8,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
202,MAT,8,NRSV,another of his disciples said to him lord first let me go and bury my father
203,MAT,8,NRSV,but jesus said to him follow me and let the dead bury their own dead
204,MAT,8,NRSV,and when he got into the boat his disciples followed him
205,MAT,8,NRSV,a windstorm arose on the sea so great that the boat was being swamped by the waves but he was asleep
206,MAT,8,NRSV,and they went and woke him up saying lord save us we are perishing and he said to them why are you afraid you of little faith
207,MAT,8,NRSV,then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a dead calm
208,MAT,8,NRSV,they were amazed saying what sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him
209,MAT,8,NRSV,when he came to the other side to the country of the gadarenes two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him
210,MAT,8,NRSV,they were so fierce that no one could pass that way
211,MAT,8,NRSV,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god
212,MAT,8,NRSV,have you come here to torment us before the time
213,MAT,8,NRSV,now a large herd of swine was feeding at some distance from them
214,MAT,8,NRSV,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine
215,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to them go so they came out and entered the swine and suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water
216,MAT,8,NRSV,the swineherds ran off and on going into the town they told the whole story about what had happened to the demoniacs
217,MAT,8,NRSV,then the whole town came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they begged him to leave their neighborhood
218,MAT,9,NRSV,and after getting into a boat he crossed the sea and came to his own town
219,MAT,9,NRSV,and just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed
220,MAT,9,NRSV,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic take heart son your sins are forgiven
221,MAT,9,NRSV,then some of the scribes said to themselves this man is blaspheming
222,MAT,9,NRSV,but jesus perceiving their thoughts said why do you think evil in your hearts
223,MAT,9,NRSV,for which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and walk
224,MAT,9,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe then said to the paralyticstand up take your bed and go to your home
225,MAT,9,NRSV,and he stood up and went to his home
226,MAT,9,NRSV,when the crowds saw it they were filled with awe and they glorified god who had given such authority to human beings
227,MAT,9,NRSV,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me
228,MAT,9,NRSV,and he got up and followed him
229,MAT,9,NRSV,and as he sat at dinner in the house many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples
230,MAT,9,NRSV,when the pharisees saw this they said to his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
231,MAT,9,NRSV,but when he heard this he said those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick
232,MAT,9,NRSV,go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice
233,MAT,9,NRSV,for i have come to call not the righteous but sinners
234,MAT,9,NRSV,then the disciples of john came to him saying why do we and the pharisees fast often but your disciples do not fast
235,MAT,9,NRSV,and jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them can they
236,MAT,9,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast
237,MAT,9,NRSV,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak for the patch pulls away from the cloak and a worse tear is made
238,MAT,9,NRSV,neither is new wine put into old wineskins otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed but new wine is put into fresh wineskins and so both are preserved
239,MAT,9,NRSV,while he was saying these things to them suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him saying my daughter has just died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live
240,MAT,9,NRSV,and jesus got up and followed him with his disciples
241,MAT,9,NRSV,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well
242,MAT,9,NRSV,jesus turned and seeing her he said take heart daughter your faith has made you well
243,MAT,9,NRSV,and instantly the woman was made well
244,MAT,9,NRSV,when jesus came to the leaders house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion he said go away for the girl is not dead but sleeping
245,MAT,9,NRSV,and they laughed at him
246,MAT,9,NRSV,but when the crowd had been put outside he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up
247,MAT,9,NRSV,and the report of this spread throughout that district
248,MAT,9,NRSV,as jesus went on from there two blind men followed him crying loudly have mercy on us son of david when he entered the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them do you believe that i am able to do this
249,MAT,9,NRSV,they said to him yes lord
250,MAT,9,NRSV,then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done to you
251,MAT,9,NRSV,and their eyes were opened
252,MAT,9,NRSV,then jesus sternly ordered them see that no one knows of this
253,MAT,9,NRSV,but they went away and spread the news about him throughout that district
254,MAT,9,NRSV,after they had gone away a demoniac who was mute was brought to him
255,MAT,9,NRSV,and when the demon had been cast out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed and said never has anything like this been seen in israel
256,MAT,9,NRSV,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons
257,MAT,9,NRSV,then jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness
258,MAT,9,NRSV,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
259,MAT,9,NRSV,then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
260,MAT,10,NRSV,then jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to cure every disease and every sickness
261,MAT,10,NRSV,these are the names of the twelve apostles first simon also known as peter and his brother andrew james son of zebedee and his brother john philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus simon the cananaean and judas iscariot the one who betrayed him
262,MAT,10,NRSV,these twelve jesus sent out with the following instructions go nowhere among the gentiles and enter no town of the samaritans but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
263,MAT,10,NRSV,as you go proclaim the good news the kingdom of heaven has come near
264,MAT,10,NRSV,cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out demons
265,MAT,10,NRSV,you received without payment give without payment
266,MAT,10,NRSV,take no gold or silver or copper in your belts no bag for your journey or two tunics or sandals or a staff for laborers deserve their food
267,MAT,10,NRSV,whatever town or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave
268,MAT,10,NRSV,as you enter the house greet it
269,MAT,10,NRSV,if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you
270,MAT,10,NRSV,if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town
271,MAT,10,NRSV,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town
272,MAT,10,NRSV,see i am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves
273,MAT,10,NRSV,beware of them for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them and the gentiles
274,MAT,10,NRSV,when they hand you over do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say for what you are to say will be given to you at that time for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you
275,MAT,10,NRSV,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name
276,MAT,10,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved
277,MAT,10,NRSV,when they persecute you in one town flee to the next for truly i tell you you will not have gone through all the towns of israel before the son of man comes
278,MAT,10,NRSV,a disciple is not above the teacher nor a slave above the master it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher and the slave like the master
279,MAT,10,NRSV,if they have called the master of the house beelzebul how much more will they malign those of his household so have no fear of them for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
280,MAT,10,NRSV,what i say to you in the dark tell in the light and what you hear whispered proclaim from the housetops
281,MAT,10,NRSV,do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell
282,MAT,10,NRSV,are not two sparrows sold for a penny
283,MAT,10,NRSV,yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father
284,MAT,10,NRSV,and even the hairs of your head are all counted
285,MAT,10,NRSV,so do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows
286,MAT,10,NRSV,everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others i also will acknowledge before my father in heaven but whoever denies me before others i also will deny before my father in heaven
287,MAT,10,NRSV,do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth i have not come to bring peace but a sword
288,MAT,10,NRSV,for i have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw and ones foes will be members of ones own household
289,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me
290,MAT,10,NRSV,those who find their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it
291,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me
292,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a discipletruly i tell you none of these will lose their reward
293,MAT,11,NRSV,now when jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and proclaim his message in their cities
294,MAT,11,NRSV,when john heard in prison what the messiah was doing he sent word by his disciples and said to him are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another
295,MAT,11,NRSV,jesus answered them go and tell john what you hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have good news brought to them
296,MAT,11,NRSV,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me
297,MAT,11,NRSV,as they went away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at
298,MAT,11,NRSV,a reed shaken by the wind
299,MAT,11,NRSV,what then did you go out to see
300,MAT,11,NRSV,someone dressed in soft robes
301,MAT,11,NRSV,look those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces
302,MAT,11,NRSV,what then did you go out to see
303,MAT,11,NRSV,a prophet
304,MAT,11,NRSV,yes i tell you and more than a prophet
305,MAT,11,NRSV,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you
306,MAT,11,NRSV,truly i tell you among those born of women no one has arisen greater than john the baptist yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
307,MAT,11,NRSV,from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force
308,MAT,11,NRSV,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john came and if you are willing to accept it he is elijah who is to come
309,MAT,11,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen but to what will i compare this generation
310,MAT,11,NRSV,it is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not mourn
311,MAT,11,NRSV,for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and they say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds
312,MAT,11,NRSV,then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done because they did not repent
313,MAT,11,NRSV,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
314,MAT,11,NRSV,but i tell you on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you
315,MAT,11,NRSV,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven
316,MAT,11,NRSV,no you will be brought down to hades
317,MAT,11,NRSV,for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day
318,MAT,11,NRSV,but i tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom than for you
319,MAT,11,NRSV,at that time jesus said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will
320,MAT,11,NRSV,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him
321,MAT,11,NRSV,come to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens and i will give you rest
322,MAT,11,NRSV,take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls
323,MAT,11,NRSV,for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
324,MAT,12,NRSV,at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples were hungry and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat
325,MAT,12,NRSV,when the pharisees saw it they said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath
326,MAT,12,NRSV,he said to them have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry
327,MAT,12,NRSV,he entered the house of god and ate the bread of the presence which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat but only for the priests
328,MAT,12,NRSV,or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless
329,MAT,12,NRSV,i tell you something greater than the temple is here
330,MAT,12,NRSV,but if you had known what this means i desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless
331,MAT,12,NRSV,for the son of man is lord of the sabbath
332,MAT,12,NRSV,he left that place and entered their synagogue a man was there with a withered hand and they asked him is it lawful to cure on the sabbath
333,MAT,12,NRSV,so that they might accuse him
334,MAT,12,NRSV,he said to them suppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath will you not lay hold of it and lift it out
335,MAT,12,NRSV,how much more valuable is a human being than a sheep so it is lawful to do good on the sabbath
336,MAT,12,NRSV,then he said to the man stretch out your hand
337,MAT,12,NRSV,he stretched it out and it was restored as sound as the other
338,MAT,12,NRSV,but the pharisees went out and conspired against him how to destroy him
339,MAT,12,NRSV,when jesus became aware of this he departed
340,MAT,12,NRSV,many crowds followed him and he cured all of them and he ordered them not to make him known
341,MAT,12,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah here is my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased
342,MAT,12,NRSV,i will put my spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles
343,MAT,12,NRSV,he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets
344,MAT,12,NRSV,he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory
345,MAT,12,NRSV,and in his name the gentiles will hope
346,MAT,12,NRSV,then they brought to him a demoniac who was blind and mute and he cured him so that the one who had been mute could speak and see
347,MAT,12,NRSV,all the crowds were amazed and said can this be the son of david
348,MAT,12,NRSV,but when the pharisees heard it they said it is only by beelzebul the ruler of the demons that this fellow casts out the demons
349,MAT,12,NRSV,he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will stand
350,MAT,12,NRSV,if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand
351,MAT,12,NRSV,if i cast out demons by beelzebul by whom do your own exorcists cast them out
352,MAT,12,NRSV,therefore they will be your judges
353,MAT,12,NRSV,but if it is by the spirit of god that i cast out demons then the kingdom of god has come to you
354,MAT,12,NRSV,or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man
355,MAT,12,NRSV,then indeed the house can be plundered
356,MAT,12,NRSV,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
357,MAT,12,NRSV,therefore i tell you people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven
358,MAT,12,NRSV,whoever speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come
359,MAT,12,NRSV,either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for the tree is known by its fruit
360,MAT,12,NRSV,you brood of vipers how can you speak good things when you are evil
361,MAT,12,NRSV,for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
362,MAT,12,NRSV,the good person brings good things out of a good treasure and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure
363,MAT,12,NRSV,i tell you on the day of judgment you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned
364,MAT,12,NRSV,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you
365,MAT,12,NRSV,but he answered them an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet jonah
366,MAT,12,NRSV,for just as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster so for three days and three nights the son of man will be in the heart of the earth
367,MAT,12,NRSV,the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here the queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but it finds none
368,MAT,12,NRSV,then it says i will return to my house from which i came
369,MAT,12,NRSV,when it comes it finds it empty swept and put in order
370,MAT,12,NRSV,then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first
371,MAT,12,NRSV,so will it be also with this evil generation
372,MAT,12,NRSV,while he was still speaking to the crowds his mother and his brothers were standing outside wanting to speak to him
373,MAT,12,NRSV,someone told him look your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you
374,MAT,12,NRSV,but to the one who had told him this jesus replied who is my mother and who are my brothers
375,MAT,12,NRSV,and pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
376,MAT,13,NRSV,that same day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea
377,MAT,13,NRSV,such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the whole crowd stood on the beach
378,MAT,13,NRSV,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow
379,MAT,13,NRSV,and as he sowed some seeds fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up
380,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and they sprang up quickly since they had no depth of soil
381,MAT,13,NRSV,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away
382,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them
383,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty
384,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen then the disciples came and asked him why do you speak to them in parables
385,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given
386,MAT,13,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
387,MAT,13,NRSV,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand
388,MAT,13,NRSV,with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah that says you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive
389,MAT,13,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them
390,MAT,13,NRSV,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
391,MAT,13,NRSV,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it
392,MAT,13,NRSV,hear then the parable of the sower
393,MAT,13,NRSV,when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path
394,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away
395,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing
396,MAT,13,NRSV,but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty
397,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away
398,MAT,13,NRSV,so when the plants came up and bore grain then the weeds appeared as well
399,MAT,13,NRSV,and the slaves of the householder came and said to him master did you not sow good seed in your field
400,MAT,13,NRSV,where then did these weeds come from
401,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered an enemy has done this
402,MAT,13,NRSV,the slaves said to him then do you want us to go and gather them
403,MAT,13,NRSV,but he replied no for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them
404,MAT,13,NRSV,let both of them grow together until the harvest and at harvest time i will tell the reapers collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn
405,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches
406,MAT,13,NRSV,he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened
407,MAT,13,NRSV,jesus told the crowds all these things in parables without a parable he told them nothing
408,MAT,13,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet i will open my mouth to speak in parables i will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world
409,MAT,13,NRSV,then he left the crowds and went into the house
410,MAT,13,NRSV,and his disciples approached him saying explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field
411,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered the one who sows the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels
412,MAT,13,NRSV,just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age
413,MAT,13,NRSV,the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers and they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
414,MAT,13,NRSV,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father
415,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears listen the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
416,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it
417,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind when it was full they drew it ashore sat down and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad
418,MAT,13,NRSV,so it will be at the end of the age
419,MAT,13,NRSV,the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
420,MAT,13,NRSV,have you understood all this
421,MAT,13,NRSV,they answered yes
422,MAT,13,NRSV,and he said to them therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old
423,MAT,13,NRSV,when jesus had finished these parables he left that place
424,MAT,13,NRSV,he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power
425,MAT,13,NRSV,is not this the carpenters son
426,MAT,13,NRSV,is not his mother called mary
427,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas
428,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not all his sisters with us
429,MAT,13,NRSV,where then did this man get all this
430,MAT,13,NRSV,and they took offense at him
431,MAT,13,NRSV,but jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house
432,MAT,13,NRSV,and he did not do many deeds of power there because of their unbelief
433,MAT,14,NRSV,at that time herod the ruler heard reports about jesus and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him
434,MAT,14,NRSV,for herod had arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because john had been telling him it is not lawful for you to have her
435,MAT,14,NRSV,though herod wanted to put him to death he feared the crowd because they regarded him as a prophet
436,MAT,14,NRSV,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask
437,MAT,14,NRSV,prompted by her mother she said give me the head of john the baptist here on a platter
438,MAT,14,NRSV,the king was grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he commanded it to be given he sent and had john beheaded in the prison
439,MAT,14,NRSV,the head was brought on a platter and given to the girl who brought it to her mother
440,MAT,14,NRSV,his disciples came and took the body and buried it then they went and told jesus
441,MAT,14,NRSV,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself
442,MAT,14,NRSV,but when the crowds heard it they followed him on foot from the towns
443,MAT,14,NRSV,when he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them and cured their sick
444,MAT,14,NRSV,when it was evening the disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves
445,MAT,14,NRSV,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat
446,MAT,14,NRSV,they replied we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish
447,MAT,14,NRSV,and he said bring them here to me
448,MAT,14,NRSV,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass
449,MAT,14,NRSV,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
450,MAT,14,NRSV,and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full
451,MAT,14,NRSV,and those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children
452,MAT,14,NRSV,immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he dismissed the crowds
453,MAT,14,NRSV,and after he had dismissed the crowds he went up the mountain by himself to pray
454,MAT,14,NRSV,when evening came he was there alone but by this time the boat battered by the waves was far from the land for the wind was against them
455,MAT,14,NRSV,and early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea
456,MAT,14,NRSV,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear
457,MAT,14,NRSV,but immediately jesus spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid
458,MAT,14,NRSV,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
459,MAT,14,NRSV,he said come
460,MAT,14,NRSV,so peter got out of the boat started walking on the water and came toward jesus
461,MAT,14,NRSV,but when he noticed the strong wind he became frightened and beginning to sink he cried out lord save me jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him saying to him you of little faith why did you doubt
462,MAT,14,NRSV,when they got into the boat the wind ceased
463,MAT,14,NRSV,and those in the boat worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god
464,MAT,14,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret
465,MAT,14,NRSV,after the people of that place recognized him they sent word throughout the region and brought all who were sick to him and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed
466,MAT,15,NRSV,then pharisees and scribes came to jesus from jerusalem and said why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders
467,MAT,15,NRSV,for they do not wash their hands before they eat
468,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered them and why do you break the commandment of god for the sake of your tradition
469,MAT,15,NRSV,for god said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die
470,MAT,15,NRSV,but you say that whoever tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is given to god then that person need not honor the father
471,MAT,15,NRSV,so for the sake of your tradition you make void the word of god
472,MAT,15,NRSV,you hypocrites isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said this people honors me with their lips but their hearts are far from me in vain do they worship me teaching human precepts as doctrines
473,MAT,15,NRSV,then he called the crowd to him and said to them listen and understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles
474,MAT,15,NRSV,then the disciples approached and said to him do you know that the pharisees took offense when they heard what you said
475,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be uprooted
476,MAT,15,NRSV,let them alone they are blind guides of the blind
477,MAT,15,NRSV,and if one blind person guides another both will fall into a pit
478,MAT,15,NRSV,but peter said to him explain this parable to us
479,MAT,15,NRSV,then he said are you also still without understanding
480,MAT,15,NRSV,do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer
481,MAT,15,NRSV,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles
482,MAT,15,NRSV,for out of the heart come evil intentions murder adultery fornication theft false witness slander
483,MAT,15,NRSV,these are what defile a person but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile
484,MAT,15,NRSV,jesus left that place and went away to the district of tyre and sidon
485,MAT,15,NRSV,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon
486,MAT,15,NRSV,but he did not answer her at all
487,MAT,15,NRSV,and his disciples came and urged him saying send her away for she keeps shouting after us
488,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
489,MAT,15,NRSV,but she came and knelt before him saying lord help me
490,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
491,MAT,15,NRSV,she said yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
492,MAT,15,NRSV,then jesus answered her woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish
493,MAT,15,NRSV,and her daughter was healed instantly
494,MAT,15,NRSV,after jesus had left that place he passed along the sea of galilee and he went up the mountain where he sat down
495,MAT,15,NRSV,great crowds came to him bringing with them the lame the maimed the blind the mute and many others
496,MAT,15,NRSV,they put them at his feet and he cured them so that the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking the maimed whole the lame walking and the blind seeing
497,MAT,15,NRSV,and they praised the god of israel
498,MAT,15,NRSV,then jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat and i do not want to send them away hungry for they might faint on the way
499,MAT,15,NRSV,the disciples said to him where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd
500,MAT,15,NRSV,jesus asked them how many loaves have you
501,MAT,15,NRSV,they said seven and a few small fish
502,MAT,15,NRSV,then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground he took the seven loaves and the fish and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
503,MAT,15,NRSV,and all of them ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full
504,MAT,15,NRSV,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children
505,MAT,15,NRSV,after sending away the crowds he got into the boat and went to the region of magadan
506,MAT,16,NRSV,the pharisees and sadducees came and to test jesus they asked him to show them a sign from heaven
507,MAT,16,NRSV,he answered them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red
508,MAT,16,NRSV,and in the morning it will be stormy today for the sky is red and threatening
509,MAT,16,NRSV,you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times
510,MAT,16,NRSV,an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah
511,MAT,16,NRSV,then he left them and went away
512,MAT,16,NRSV,when the disciples reached the other side they had forgotten to bring any bread
513,MAT,16,NRSV,jesus said to them watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
514,MAT,16,NRSV,they said to one another it is because we have brought no bread
515,MAT,16,NRSV,and becoming aware of it jesus said you of little faith why are you talking about having no bread
516,MAT,16,NRSV,do you still not perceive
517,MAT,16,NRSV,do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered
518,MAT,16,NRSV,or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered
519,MAT,16,NRSV,how could you fail to perceive that i was not speaking about bread
520,MAT,16,NRSV,beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of bread but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
521,MAT,16,NRSV,now when jesus came into the district of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples who do people say that the son of man is
522,MAT,16,NRSV,and they said some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
523,MAT,16,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am
524,MAT,16,NRSV,simon peter answered you are the messiah the son of the living god
525,MAT,16,NRSV,and jesus answered him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven
526,MAT,16,NRSV,and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it
527,MAT,16,NRSV,i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
528,MAT,16,NRSV,then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah
529,MAT,16,NRSV,from that time on jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised
530,MAT,16,NRSV,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying god forbid it lord this must never happen to you
531,MAT,16,NRSV,but he turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things
532,MAT,16,NRSV,then jesus told his disciples if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me
533,MAT,16,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it
534,MAT,16,NRSV,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life
535,MAT,16,NRSV,or what will they give in return for their life
536,MAT,16,NRSV,for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay everyone for what has been done
537,MAT,16,NRSV,truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
538,MAT,17,NRSV,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and his brother john and led them up a high mountain by themselves
539,MAT,17,NRSV,and he was transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became dazzling white
540,MAT,17,NRSV,suddenly there appeared to them moses and elijah talking with him
541,MAT,17,NRSV,then peter said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you wish i will make three dwellings here one for you one for moses and one for elijah
542,MAT,17,NRSV,while he was still speaking suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud a voice said this is my son the beloved with him i am well pleased listen to him when the disciples heard this they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear
543,MAT,17,NRSV,but jesus came and touched them saying get up and do not be afraid
544,MAT,17,NRSV,and when they looked up they saw no one except jesus himself alone
545,MAT,17,NRSV,as they were coming down the mountain jesus ordered them tell no one about the vision until after the son of man has been raised from the dead
546,MAT,17,NRSV,and the disciples asked him why then do the scribes say that elijah must come first
547,MAT,17,NRSV,he replied elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things but i tell you that elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but they did to him whatever they pleased
548,MAT,17,NRSV,so also the son of man is about to suffer at their hands
549,MAT,17,NRSV,then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about john the baptist
550,MAT,17,NRSV,when they came to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him and said lord have mercy on my son for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly he often falls into the fire and often into the water
551,MAT,17,NRSV,and i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
552,MAT,17,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you
553,MAT,17,NRSV,how much longer must i put up with you
554,MAT,17,NRSV,bring him here to me
555,MAT,17,NRSV,and jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was cured instantly
556,MAT,17,NRSV,then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why could we not cast it out
557,MAT,17,NRSV,he said to them because of your little faith
558,MAT,17,NRSV,for truly i tell you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you
559,MAT,17,NRSV,as they were gathering in galilee jesus said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised
560,MAT,17,NRSV,and they were greatly distressed
561,MAT,17,NRSV,when they reached capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to peter and said does your teacher not pay the temple tax
562,MAT,17,NRSV,he said yes he does
563,MAT,17,NRSV,and when he came home jesus spoke of it first asking what do you think simon
564,MAT,17,NRSV,from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute
565,MAT,17,NRSV,from their children or from others
566,MAT,17,NRSV,when peter said from others jesus said to him then the children are free
567,MAT,17,NRSV,however so that we do not give offense to them go to the sea and cast a hook take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a coin take that and give it to them for you and me
568,MAT,18,NRSV,at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
569,MAT,18,NRSV,he called a child whom he put among them and said truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
570,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
571,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me
572,MAT,18,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea
573,MAT,18,NRSV,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire
574,MAT,18,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire
575,MAT,18,NRSV,take care that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you in heaven their angels continually see the face of my father in heaven
576,MAT,18,NRSV,what do you think
577,MAT,18,NRSV,if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray
578,MAT,18,NRSV,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray
579,MAT,18,NRSV,so it is not the will of your father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost
580,MAT,18,NRSV,if another member of the church sins against you go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone
581,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member listens to you you have regained that one
582,MAT,18,NRSV,but if you are not listened to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses
583,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church let such a one be to you as a gentile and a tax collector
584,MAT,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
585,MAT,18,NRSV,again truly i tell you if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven
586,MAT,18,NRSV,for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them
587,MAT,18,NRSV,then peter came and said to him lord if another member of the church sins against me how often should i forgive
588,MAT,18,NRSV,as many as seven times
589,MAT,18,NRSV,jesus said to him not seven times but i tell you seventyseven times
590,MAT,18,NRSV,for this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves
591,MAT,18,NRSV,when he began the reckoning one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him and as he could not pay his lord ordered him to be sold together with his wife and children and all his possessions and payment to be made
592,MAT,18,NRSV,so the slave fell on his knees before him saying have patience with me and i will pay you everything
593,MAT,18,NRSV,and out of pity for him the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt
594,MAT,18,NRSV,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe
595,MAT,18,NRSV,then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him have patience with me and i will pay you
596,MAT,18,NRSV,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt
597,MAT,18,NRSV,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place
598,MAT,18,NRSV,then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me
599,MAT,18,NRSV,should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave as i had mercy on you
600,MAT,18,NRSV,and in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt
601,MAT,18,NRSV,so my heavenly father will also do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart
602,MAT,19,NRSV,when jesus had finished saying these things he left galilee and went to the region of judea beyond the jordan
603,MAT,19,NRSV,large crowds followed him and he cured them there
604,MAT,19,NRSV,some pharisees came to him and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause
605,MAT,19,NRSV,he answered have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
606,MAT,19,NRSV,so they are no longer two but one flesh
607,MAT,19,NRSV,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate
608,MAT,19,NRSV,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her
609,MAT,19,NRSV,he said to them it was because you were so hardhearted that moses allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so
610,MAT,19,NRSV,and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for unchastity and marries another commits adultery
611,MAT,19,NRSV,his disciples said to him if such is the case of a man with his wife it is better not to marry
612,MAT,19,NRSV,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given
613,MAT,19,NRSV,for there are eunuchs who have been so from birth and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven
614,MAT,19,NRSV,let anyone accept this who can
615,MAT,19,NRSV,then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray
616,MAT,19,NRSV,the disciples spoke sternly to those who brought them but jesus said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs
617,MAT,19,NRSV,and he laid his hands on them and went on his way
618,MAT,19,NRSV,then someone came to him and said teacher what good deed must i do to have eternal life
619,MAT,19,NRSV,and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good
620,MAT,19,NRSV,there is only one who is good
621,MAT,19,NRSV,if you wish to enter into life keep the commandments
622,MAT,19,NRSV,he said to him which ones
623,MAT,19,NRSV,and jesus said you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother also you shall love your neighbor as yourself
624,MAT,19,NRSV,the young man said to him i have kept all these what do i still lack
625,MAT,19,NRSV,jesus said to him if you wish to be perfect go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
626,MAT,19,NRSV,when the young man heard this word he went away grieving for he had many possessions
627,MAT,19,NRSV,then jesus said to his disciples truly i tell you it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven
628,MAT,19,NRSV,again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
629,MAT,19,NRSV,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved
630,MAT,19,NRSV,but jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but for god all things are possible
631,MAT,19,NRSV,then peter said in reply look we have left everything and followed you
632,MAT,19,NRSV,what then will we have
633,MAT,19,NRSV,jesus said to them truly i tell you at the renewal of all things when the son of man is seated on the throne of his glory you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
634,MAT,19,NRSV,and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my names sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life
635,MAT,19,NRSV,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first
636,MAT,20,NRSV,for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard
637,MAT,20,NRSV,after agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard
638,MAT,20,NRSV,when he went out about nine oclock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and he said to them you also go into the vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right
639,MAT,20,NRSV,so they went
640,MAT,20,NRSV,when he went out again about noon and about three oclock he did the same
641,MAT,20,NRSV,and about five oclock he went out and found others standing around and he said to them why are you standing here idle all day
642,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him because no one has hired us
643,MAT,20,NRSV,he said to them you also go into the vineyard
644,MAT,20,NRSV,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first
645,MAT,20,NRSV,when those hired about five oclock came each of them received the usual daily wage
646,MAT,20,NRSV,now when the first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received the usual daily wage
647,MAT,20,NRSV,and when they received it they grumbled against the landowner saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat
648,MAT,20,NRSV,but he replied to one of them friend i am doing you no wrong did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage
649,MAT,20,NRSV,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you
650,MAT,20,NRSV,am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me
651,MAT,20,NRSV,or are you envious because i am generous
652,MAT,20,NRSV,so the last will be first and the first will be last
653,MAT,20,NRSV,while jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them on the way see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified and on the third day he will be raised
654,MAT,20,NRSV,then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to him with her sons and kneeling before him she asked a favor of him
655,MAT,20,NRSV,and he said to her what do you want
656,MAT,20,NRSV,she said to him declare that these two sons of mine will sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom
657,MAT,20,NRSV,but jesus answered you do not know what you are asking
658,MAT,20,NRSV,are you able to drink the cup that i am about to drink
659,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him we are able
660,MAT,20,NRSV,he said to them you will indeed drink my cup but to sit at my right hand and at my left this is not mine to grant but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my father
661,MAT,20,NRSV,when the ten heard it they were angry with the two brothers
662,MAT,20,NRSV,but jesus called them to him and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them
663,MAT,20,NRSV,it will not be so among you but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave just as the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
664,MAT,20,NRSV,as they were leaving jericho a large crowd followed him
665,MAT,20,NRSV,there were two blind men sitting by the roadside
666,MAT,20,NRSV,when they heard that jesus was passing by they shouted lord have mercy on us son of david the crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet but they shouted even more loudly have mercy on us lord son of david jesus stood still and called them saying what do you want me to do for you
667,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him lord let our eyes be opened
668,MAT,20,NRSV,moved with compassion jesus touched their eyes
669,MAT,20,NRSV,immediately they regained their sight and followed him
670,MAT,21,NRSV,when they had come near jerusalem and had reached bethphage at the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples saying to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me
671,MAT,21,NRSV,if anyone says anything to you just say this the lord needs them
672,MAT,21,NRSV,and he will send them immediately
673,MAT,21,NRSV,this took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion look your king is coming to you humble and mounted on a donkey and on a colt the foal of a donkey
674,MAT,21,NRSV,the disciples went and did as jesus had directed them they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and he sat on them
675,MAT,21,NRSV,a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road
676,MAT,21,NRSV,the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in turmoil asking who is this
677,MAT,21,NRSV,the crowds were saying this is the prophet jesus from nazareth in galilee
678,MAT,21,NRSV,then jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves
679,MAT,21,NRSV,he said to them it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of robbers
680,MAT,21,NRSV,the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he cured them
681,MAT,21,NRSV,but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did and heard the children crying out in the temple hosanna to the son of david they became angry and said to him do you hear what these are saying
682,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them yes have you never read out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself
683,MAT,21,NRSV,he left them went out of the city to bethany and spent the night there
684,MAT,21,NRSV,in the morning when he returned to the city he was hungry
685,MAT,21,NRSV,and seeing a fig tree by the side of the road he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves
686,MAT,21,NRSV,then he said to it may no fruit ever come from you again and the fig tree withered at once
687,MAT,21,NRSV,when the disciples saw it they were amazed saying how did the fig tree wither at once
688,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus answered them truly i tell you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will be done
689,MAT,21,NRSV,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive
690,MAT,21,NRSV,when he entered the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said by what authority are you doing these things and who gave you this authority
691,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them i will also ask you one question if you tell me the answer then i will also tell you by what authority i do these things
692,MAT,21,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin
693,MAT,21,NRSV,and they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not believe him
694,MAT,21,NRSV,but if we say of human origin we are afraid of the crowd for all regard john as a prophet
695,MAT,21,NRSV,so they answered jesus we do not know
696,MAT,21,NRSV,and he said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things
697,MAT,21,NRSV,what do you think
698,MAT,21,NRSV,a man had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work in the vineyard today
699,MAT,21,NRSV,he answered i will not but later he changed his mind and went
700,MAT,21,NRSV,the father went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go
701,MAT,21,NRSV,which of the two did the will of his father
702,MAT,21,NRSV,they said the first
703,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them truly i tell you the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of god ahead of you
704,MAT,21,NRSV,for john came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him and even after you saw it you did not change your minds and believe him
705,MAT,21,NRSV,listen to another parable
706,MAT,21,NRSV,there was a landowner who planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a wine press in it and built a watchtower
707,MAT,21,NRSV,then he leased it to tenants and went to another country
708,MAT,21,NRSV,when the harvest time had come he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce
709,MAT,21,NRSV,but the tenants seized his slaves and beat one killed another and stoned another
710,MAT,21,NRSV,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way
711,MAT,21,NRSV,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son
712,MAT,21,NRSV,but when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and get his inheritance
713,MAT,21,NRSV,so they seized him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
714,MAT,21,NRSV,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants
715,MAT,21,NRSV,they said to him he will put those wretches to a miserable death and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time
716,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them have you never read in the scriptures the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the lords doing and it is amazing in our eyes
717,MAT,21,NRSV,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom
718,MAT,21,NRSV,the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces and it will crush anyone on whom it falls
719,MAT,21,NRSV,when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they realized that he was speaking about them
720,MAT,21,NRSV,they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet
721,MAT,22,NRSV,once more jesus spoke to them in parables saying the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son
722,MAT,22,NRSV,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come
723,MAT,22,NRSV,again he sent other slaves saying tell those who have been invited look i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet
724,MAT,22,NRSV,but they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his business while the rest seized his slaves mistreated them and killed them
725,MAT,22,NRSV,the king was enraged
726,MAT,22,NRSV,he sent his troops destroyed those murderers and burned their city
727,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to his slaves the wedding is ready but those invited were not worthy
728,MAT,22,NRSV,go therefore into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet
729,MAT,22,NRSV,those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found both good and bad so the wedding hall was filled with guests
730,MAT,22,NRSV,but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding robe
731,MAT,22,NRSV,and he was speechless
732,MAT,22,NRSV,then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
733,MAT,22,NRSV,for many are called but few are chosen
734,MAT,22,NRSV,then the pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said
735,MAT,22,NRSV,so they sent their disciples to him along with the herodians saying teacher we know that you are sincere and teach the way of god in accordance with truth and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality
736,MAT,22,NRSV,tell us then what you think
737,MAT,22,NRSV,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not
738,MAT,22,NRSV,but jesus aware of their malice said why are you putting me to the test you hypocrites
739,MAT,22,NRSV,show me the coin used for the tax
740,MAT,22,NRSV,and they brought him a denarius
741,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title
742,MAT,22,NRSV,they answered the emperors
743,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to them give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods
744,MAT,22,NRSV,when they heard this they were amazed and they left him and went away
745,MAT,22,NRSV,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection and they asked him a question saying teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
746,MAT,22,NRSV,now there were seven brothers among us the first married and died childless leaving the widow to his brother
747,MAT,22,NRSV,the second did the same so also the third down to the seventh
748,MAT,22,NRSV,last of all the woman herself died
749,MAT,22,NRSV,in the resurrection then whose wife of the seven will she be
750,MAT,22,NRSV,for all of them had married her
751,MAT,22,NRSV,jesus answered them you are wrong because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god
752,MAT,22,NRSV,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven
753,MAT,22,NRSV,and as for the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was said to you by god i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
754,MAT,22,NRSV,he is god not of the dead but of the living
755,MAT,22,NRSV,and when the crowd heard it they were astounded at his teaching
756,MAT,22,NRSV,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him
757,MAT,22,NRSV,teacher which commandment in the law is the greatest
758,MAT,22,NRSV,he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
759,MAT,22,NRSV,this is the greatest and first commandment
760,MAT,22,NRSV,and a second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself
761,MAT,22,NRSV,on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
762,MAT,22,NRSV,now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them this question what do you think of the messiah
763,MAT,22,NRSV,whose son is he
764,MAT,22,NRSV,they said to him the son of david
765,MAT,22,NRSV,he said to them how is it then that david by the spirit calls him lord saying the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet 
766,MAT,22,NRSV,if david thus calls him lord how can he be his son
767,MAT,22,NRSV,no one was able to give him an answer nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions
768,MAT,23,NRSV,then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach
769,MAT,23,NRSV,they tie up heavy burdens hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of others but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them
770,MAT,23,NRSV,they do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long
771,MAT,23,NRSV,they love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi
772,MAT,23,NRSV,but you are not to be called rabbi for you have one teacher and you are all students
773,MAT,23,NRSV,and call no one your father on earth for you have one fatherthe one in heaven
774,MAT,23,NRSV,nor are you to be called instructors for you have one instructor the messiah
775,MAT,23,NRSV,the greatest among you will be your servant
776,MAT,23,NRSV,all who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves will be exalted
777,MAT,23,NRSV,but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven
778,MAT,23,NRSV,for you do not go in yourselves and when others are going in you stop them
779,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you cross sea and land to make a single convert and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves
780,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you blind guides who say whoever swears by the sanctuary is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath
781,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind fools for which is greater the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred
782,MAT,23,NRSV,and you say whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath
783,MAT,23,NRSV,how blind you are for which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred
784,MAT,23,NRSV,so whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it and whoever swears by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who dwells in it and whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of god and by the one who is seated upon it
785,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith
786,MAT,23,NRSV,it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others
787,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind guides you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence
788,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup so that the outside also may become clean
789,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside look beautiful but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth
790,MAT,23,NRSV,so you also on the outside look righteous to others but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness
791,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets
792,MAT,23,NRSV,thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets
793,MAT,23,NRSV,fill up then the measure of your ancestors
794,MAT,23,NRSV,you snakes you brood of vipers how can you escape being sentenced to hell
795,MAT,23,NRSV,therefore i send you prophets sages and scribes some of whom you will kill and crucify and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah son of barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar
796,MAT,23,NRSV,truly i tell you all this will come upon this generation
797,MAT,23,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing see your house is left to you desolate
798,MAT,23,NRSV,for i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
799,MAT,23,NRSV,
800,MAT,24,NRSV,as jesus came out of the temple and was going away his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple
801,MAT,24,NRSV,then he asked them you see all these do you not
802,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down
803,MAT,24,NRSV,when he was sitting on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when will this be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age
804,MAT,24,NRSV,jesus answered them beware that no one leads you astray
805,MAT,24,NRSV,for many will come in my name saying i am the messiah and they will lead many astray
806,MAT,24,NRSV,and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not alarmed for this must take place but the end is not yet
807,MAT,24,NRSV,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs
808,MAT,24,NRSV,then they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name
809,MAT,24,NRSV,then many will fall away and they will betray one another and hate one another
810,MAT,24,NRSV,and many false prophets will arise and lead many astray
811,MAT,24,NRSV,and because of the increase of lawlessness the love of many will grow cold
812,MAT,24,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved
813,MAT,24,NRSV,and this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come
814,MAT,24,NRSV,so when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place as was spoken of by the prophet daniel let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat
815,MAT,24,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath
816,MAT,24,NRSV,for at that time there will be great suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no and never will be
817,MAT,24,NRSV,and if those days had not been cut short no one would be saved but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short
818,MAT,24,NRSV,then if anyone says to you look here is the messiah or there he isdo not believe it
819,MAT,24,NRSV,for false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens to lead astray if possible even the elect
820,MAT,24,NRSV,take note i have told you beforehand
821,MAT,24,NRSV,so if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out
822,MAT,24,NRSV,if they say look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
823,MAT,24,NRSV,for as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west so will be the coming of the son of man
824,MAT,24,NRSV,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather
825,MAT,24,NRSV,immediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of heaven will be shaken
826,MAT,24,NRSV,then the sign of the son of man will appear in heaven and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
827,MAT,24,NRSV,and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
828,MAT,24,NRSV,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near
829,MAT,24,NRSV,so also when you see all these things you know that he is near at the very gates
830,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place
831,MAT,24,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
832,MAT,24,NRSV,but about that day and hour no one knows neither the angels of heaven nor the son but only the father
833,MAT,24,NRSV,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man
834,MAT,24,NRSV,for as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away so too will be the coming of the son of man
835,MAT,24,NRSV,then two will be in the field one will be taken and one will be left
836,MAT,24,NRSV,two women will be grinding meal together one will be taken and one will be left
837,MAT,24,NRSV,keep awake therefore for you do not know on what day your lord is coming
838,MAT,24,NRSV,but understand this if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into
839,MAT,24,NRSV,therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour
840,MAT,24,NRSV,who then is the faithful and wise slave whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time
841,MAT,24,NRSV,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives
842,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions
843,MAT,24,NRSV,but if that wicked slave says to himself my master is delayed and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know
844,MAT,24,NRSV,he will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
845,MAT,25,NRSV,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this
846,MAT,25,NRSV,ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom
847,MAT,25,NRSV,five of them were foolish and five were wise
848,MAT,25,NRSV,when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps
849,MAT,25,NRSV,as the bridegroom was delayed all of them became drowsy and slept
850,MAT,25,NRSV,but at midnight there was a shout look here is the bridegroom come out to meet him
851,MAT,25,NRSV,then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps
852,MAT,25,NRSV,the foolish said to the wise give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out
853,MAT,25,NRSV,but the wise replied no there will not be enough for you and for us you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves
854,MAT,25,NRSV,and while they went to buy it the bridegroom came and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet and the door was shut
855,MAT,25,NRSV,later the other bridesmaids came also saying lord lord open to us
856,MAT,25,NRSV,but he replied truly i tell you i do not know you
857,MAT,25,NRSV,keep awake therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour
858,MAT,25,NRSV,for it is as if a man going on a journey summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them to one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his ability
859,MAT,25,NRSV,then he went away
860,MAT,25,NRSV,the one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them and made five more talents
861,MAT,25,NRSV,in the same way the one who had the two talents made two more talents
862,MAT,25,NRSV,but the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money
863,MAT,25,NRSV,after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them
864,MAT,25,NRSV,then the one who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more talents saying master you handed over to me five talents see i have made five more talents
865,MAT,25,NRSV,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master
866,MAT,25,NRSV,and the one with the two talents also came forward saying master you handed over to me two talents see i have made two more talents
867,MAT,25,NRSV,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master
868,MAT,25,NRSV,then the one who had received the one talent also came forward saying master i knew that you were a harsh man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed so i was afraid and i went and hid your talent in the ground
869,MAT,25,NRSV,here you have what is yours
870,MAT,25,NRSV,but his master replied you wicked and lazy slave you knew did you that i reap where i did not sow and gather where i did not scatter
871,MAT,25,NRSV,then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and on my return i would have received what was my own with interest
872,MAT,25,NRSV,so take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents
873,MAT,25,NRSV,for to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
874,MAT,25,NRSV,as for this worthless slave throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
875,MAT,25,NRSV,when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory
876,MAT,25,NRSV,all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left
877,MAT,25,NRSV,then the king will say to those at his right hand come you that are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you welcomed me i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you took care of me i was in prison and you visited me
878,MAT,25,NRSV,then the righteous will answer him lord when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food or thirsty and gave you something to drink
879,MAT,25,NRSV,and when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you or naked and gave you clothing
880,MAT,25,NRSV,and when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you
881,MAT,25,NRSV,and the king will answer them truly i tell you just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family you did it to me
882,MAT,25,NRSV,then he will say to those at his left hand you that are accursed depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink i was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not give me clothing sick and in prison and you did not visit me
883,MAT,25,NRSV,then they also will answer lord when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not take care of you
884,MAT,25,NRSV,then he will answer them truly i tell you just as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me
885,MAT,25,NRSV,and these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life
886,MAT,26,NRSV,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified
887,MAT,26,NRSV,then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas and they conspired to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him
888,MAT,26,NRSV,but they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people
889,MAT,26,NRSV,now while jesus was at bethany in the house of simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table
890,MAT,26,NRSV,but when the disciples saw it they were angry and said why this waste
891,MAT,26,NRSV,for this ointment could have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor
892,MAT,26,NRSV,but jesus aware of this said to them why do you trouble the woman
893,MAT,26,NRSV,she has performed a good service for me
894,MAT,26,NRSV,for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
895,MAT,26,NRSV,by pouring this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial
896,MAT,26,NRSV,truly i tell you wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her
897,MAT,26,NRSV,then one of the twelve who was called judas iscariot went to the chief priests and said what will you give me if i betray him to you
898,MAT,26,NRSV,they paid him thirty pieces of silver
899,MAT,26,NRSV,and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him
900,MAT,26,NRSV,on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the passover
901,MAT,26,NRSV,he said go into the city to a certain man and say to him the teacher says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples
902,MAT,26,NRSV,so the disciples did as jesus had directed them and they prepared the passover meal
903,MAT,26,NRSV,when it was evening he took his place with the twelve and while they were eating he said truly i tell you one of you will betray me
904,MAT,26,NRSV,and they became greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another surely not i lord
905,MAT,26,NRSV,he answered the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me
906,MAT,26,NRSV,the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born
907,MAT,26,NRSV,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi
908,MAT,26,NRSV,he replied you have said so
909,MAT,26,NRSV,while they were eating jesus took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body
910,MAT,26,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
911,MAT,26,NRSV,i tell you i will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom
912,MAT,26,NRSV,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives
913,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus said to them you will all become deserters because of me this night for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
914,MAT,26,NRSV,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee
915,MAT,26,NRSV,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you
916,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him truly i tell you this very night before the cock crows you will deny me three times
917,MAT,26,NRSV,peter said to him even though i must die with you i will not deny you
918,MAT,26,NRSV,and so said all the disciples
919,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus went with them to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i go over there and pray
920,MAT,26,NRSV,he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be grieved and agitated
921,MAT,26,NRSV,then he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and stay awake with me
922,MAT,26,NRSV,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed my father if it is possible let this cup pass from me yet not what i want but what you want
923,MAT,26,NRSV,then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping and he said to peter so could you not stay awake with me one hour
924,MAT,26,NRSV,stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
925,MAT,26,NRSV,again he went away for the second time and prayed my father if this cannot pass unless i drink it your will be done
926,MAT,26,NRSV,again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy
927,MAT,26,NRSV,so leaving them again he went away and prayed for the third time saying the same words
928,MAT,26,NRSV,then he came to the disciples and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest
929,MAT,26,NRSV,see the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
930,MAT,26,NRSV,get up let us be going
931,MAT,26,NRSV,see my betrayer is at hand
932,MAT,26,NRSV,while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the elders of the people
933,MAT,26,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him
934,MAT,26,NRSV,at once he came up to jesus and said greetings rabbi and kissed him
935,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him friend do what you are here to do
936,MAT,26,NRSV,then they came and laid hands on jesus and arrested him
937,MAT,26,NRSV,suddenly one of those with jesus put his hand on his sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear
938,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus said to him put your sword back into its place for all who take the sword will perish by the sword
939,MAT,26,NRSV,do you think that i cannot appeal to my father and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels
940,MAT,26,NRSV,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way
941,MAT,26,NRSV,at that hour jesus said to the crowds have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though i were a bandit
942,MAT,26,NRSV,day after day i sat in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me
943,MAT,26,NRSV,but all this has taken place so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled
944,MAT,26,NRSV,then all the disciples deserted him and fled
945,MAT,26,NRSV,those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered
946,MAT,26,NRSV,but peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and going inside he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end
947,MAT,26,NRSV,now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against jesus so that they might put him to death but they found none though many false witnesses came forward
948,MAT,26,NRSV,at last two came forward and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
949,MAT,26,NRSV,the high priest stood up and said have you no answer
950,MAT,26,NRSV,what is it that they testify against you
951,MAT,26,NRSV,but jesus was silent
952,MAT,26,NRSV,then the high priest said to him i put you under oath before the living god tell us if you are the messiah the son of god
953,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him you have said so
954,MAT,26,NRSV,but i tell you from now on you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven
955,MAT,26,NRSV,then the high priest tore his clothes and said he has blasphemed why do we still need witnesses
956,MAT,26,NRSV,you have now heard his blasphemy
957,MAT,26,NRSV,what is your verdict
958,MAT,26,NRSV,they answered he deserves death
959,MAT,26,NRSV,then they spat in his face and struck him and some slapped him saying prophesy to us you messiah who is it that struck you
960,MAT,26,NRSV,now peter was sitting outside in the courtyard
961,MAT,26,NRSV,a servantgirl came to him and said you also were with jesus the galilean
962,MAT,26,NRSV,but he denied it before all of them saying i do not know what you are talking about
963,MAT,26,NRSV,when he went out to the porch another servantgirl saw him and she said to the bystanders this man was with jesus of nazareth
964,MAT,26,NRSV,again he denied it with an oath i do not know the man
965,MAT,26,NRSV,after a little while the bystanders came up and said to peter certainly you are also one of them for your accent betrays you
966,MAT,26,NRSV,then he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know the man at that moment the cock crowed
967,MAT,26,NRSV,then peter remembered what jesus had said before the cock crows you will deny me three times
968,MAT,26,NRSV,and he went out and wept bitterly
969,MAT,27,NRSV,when morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against jesus in order to bring about his death
970,MAT,27,NRSV,they bound him led him away and handed him over to pilate the governor
971,MAT,27,NRSV,when judas his betrayer saw that jesus was condemned he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders
972,MAT,27,NRSV,he said i have sinned by betraying innocent blood
973,MAT,27,NRSV,but they said what is that to us
974,MAT,27,NRSV,see to it yourself
975,MAT,27,NRSV,throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple he departed and he went and hanged himself
976,MAT,27,NRSV,but the chief priests taking the pieces of silver said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury since they are blood money
977,MAT,27,NRSV,after conferring together they used them to buy the potters field as a place to bury foreigners
978,MAT,27,NRSV,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day
979,MAT,27,NRSV,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of the one on whom a price had been set on whom some of the people of israel had set a price and they gave them for the potters field as the lord commanded me
980,MAT,27,NRSV,now jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him are you the king of the jews
981,MAT,27,NRSV,jesus said you say so
982,MAT,27,NRSV,but when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he did not answer
983,MAT,27,NRSV,then pilate said to him do you not hear how many accusations they make against you
984,MAT,27,NRSV,but he gave him no answer not even to a single charge so that the governor was greatly amazed
985,MAT,27,NRSV,now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd anyone whom they wanted
986,MAT,27,NRSV,at that time they had a notorious prisoner called jesus barabbas
987,MAT,27,NRSV,so after they had gathered pilate said to them whom do you want me to release for you jesus barabbas or jesus who is called the messiah
988,MAT,27,NRSV,for he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over
989,MAT,27,NRSV,while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent word to him have nothing to do with that innocent man for today i have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him
990,MAT,27,NRSV,now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for barabbas and to have jesus killed
991,MAT,27,NRSV,the governor again said to them which of the two do you want me to release for you
992,MAT,27,NRSV,and they said barabbas
993,MAT,27,NRSV,pilate said to them then what should i do with jesus who is called the messiah
994,MAT,27,NRSV,all of them said let him be crucified then he asked why what evil has he done
995,MAT,27,NRSV,but they shouted all the more let him be crucified so when pilate saw that he could do nothing but rather that a riot was beginning he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd saying i am innocent of this mans blood see to it yourselves
996,MAT,27,NRSV,then the people as a whole answered his blood be on us and on our children so he released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified
997,MAT,27,NRSV,then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the governors headquarters and they gathered the whole cohort around him
998,MAT,27,NRSV,they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on his head
999,MAT,27,NRSV,they put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head
1000,MAT,27,NRSV,after mocking him they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him
1001,MAT,27,NRSV,then they led him away to crucify him
1002,MAT,27,NRSV,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross
1003,MAT,27,NRSV,and when they came to a place called golgotha which means place of a skull they offered him wine to drink mixed with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it
1004,MAT,27,NRSV,and when they had crucified him they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots then they sat down there and kept watch over him
1005,MAT,27,NRSV,over his head they put the charge against him which read this is jesus the king of the jews
1006,MAT,27,NRSV,then two bandits were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left
1007,MAT,27,NRSV,those who passed by derided him shaking their heads and saying you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself if you are the son of god come down from the cross
1008,MAT,27,NRSV,in the same way the chief priests also along with the scribes and elders were mocking him saying he saved others he cannot save himself
1009,MAT,27,NRSV,he is the king of israel let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him
1010,MAT,27,NRSV,he trusts in god let god deliver him now if he wants to for he said i am gods son
1011,MAT,27,NRSV,the bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way
1012,MAT,27,NRSV,from noon on darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon
1013,MAT,27,NRSV,and about three oclock jesus cried with a loud voice eli eli lema sabachthani
1014,MAT,27,NRSV,that is my god my god why have you forsaken me
1015,MAT,27,NRSV,when some of the bystanders heard it they said this man is calling for elijah
1016,MAT,27,NRSV,at once one of them ran and got a sponge filled it with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink
1017,MAT,27,NRSV,but the others said wait let us see whether elijah will come to save him
1018,MAT,27,NRSV,then jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last
1019,MAT,27,NRSV,at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
1020,MAT,27,NRSV,the earth shook and the rocks were split
1021,MAT,27,NRSV,the tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised
1022,MAT,27,NRSV,after his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many
1023,MAT,27,NRSV,now when the centurion and those with him who were keeping watch over jesus saw the earthquake and what took place they were terrified and said truly this man was gods son many women were also there looking on from a distance they had followed jesus from galilee and had provided for him
1024,MAT,27,NRSV,among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joseph and the mother of the sons of zebedee
1025,MAT,27,NRSV,when it was evening there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who was also a disciple of jesus
1026,MAT,27,NRSV,he went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus then pilate ordered it to be given to him
1027,MAT,27,NRSV,so joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn in the rock
1028,MAT,27,NRSV,he then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away
1029,MAT,27,NRSV,mary magdalene and the other mary were there sitting opposite the tomb
1030,MAT,27,NRSV,the next day that is after the day of preparation the chief priests and the pharisees gathered before pilate and said sir we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive after three days i will rise again
1031,MAT,27,NRSV,therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away and tell the people he has been raised from the dead and the last deception would be worse than the first
1032,MAT,27,NRSV,pilate said to them you have a guard of soldiers go make it as secure as you can
1033,MAT,27,NRSV,so they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone
1034,MAT,28,NRSV,after the sabbath as the first day of the week was dawning mary magdalene and the other mary went to see the tomb
1035,MAT,28,NRSV,and suddenly there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descending from heaven came and rolled back the stone and sat on it
1036,MAT,28,NRSV,his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow
1037,MAT,28,NRSV,for fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men
1038,MAT,28,NRSV,but the angel said to the women do not be afraid i know that you are looking for jesus who was crucified
1039,MAT,28,NRSV,he is not here for he has been raised as he said
1040,MAT,28,NRSV,come see the place where he lay
1041,MAT,28,NRSV,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him
1042,MAT,28,NRSV,this is my message for you
1043,MAT,28,NRSV,so they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples
1044,MAT,28,NRSV,suddenly jesus met them and said greetings and they came to him took hold of his feet and worshiped him
1045,MAT,28,NRSV,then jesus said to them do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to galilee there they will see me
1046,MAT,28,NRSV,while they were going some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened
1047,MAT,28,NRSV,after the priests had assembled with the elders they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers telling them you must say his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep
1048,MAT,28,NRSV,if this comes to the governors ears we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble
1049,MAT,28,NRSV,so they took the money and did as they were directed
1050,MAT,28,NRSV,and this story is still told among the jews to this day
1051,MAT,28,NRSV,now the eleven disciples went to galilee to the mountain to which jesus had directed them
1052,MAT,28,NRSV,when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted
1053,MAT,28,NRSV,and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
1054,MAT,28,NRSV,go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything that i have commanded you
1055,MAT,28,NRSV,and remember i am with you always to the end of the age
1056,MRK,1,NRSV,the beginning of the good news of jesus christ the son of god
1057,MRK,1,NRSV,as it is written in the prophet isaiah see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight john the baptizer appeared in the wilderness proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins
1058,MRK,1,NRSV,and people from the whole judean countryside and all the people of jerusalem were going out to him and were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins
1059,MRK,1,NRSV,now john was clothed with camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey
1060,MRK,1,NRSV,he proclaimed the one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals
1061,MRK,1,NRSV,i have baptized you with water but he will baptize you with the holy spirit
1062,MRK,1,NRSV,in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan
1063,MRK,1,NRSV,and just as he was coming up out of the water he saw the heavens torn apart and the spirit descending like a dove on him
1064,MRK,1,NRSV,and a voice came from heaven you are my son the beloved with you i am well pleased
1065,MRK,1,NRSV,and the spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness
1066,MRK,1,NRSV,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him
1067,MRK,1,NRSV,now after john was arrested jesus came to galilee proclaiming the good news of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe in the good news
1068,MRK,1,NRSV,as jesus passed along the sea of galilee he saw simon and his brother andrew casting a net into the seafor they were fishermen
1069,MRK,1,NRSV,and jesus said to them follow me and i will make you fish for people
1070,MRK,1,NRSV,and immediately they left their nets and followed him
1071,MRK,1,NRSV,as he went a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john who were in their boat mending the nets
1072,MRK,1,NRSV,immediately he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him
1073,MRK,1,NRSV,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught
1074,MRK,1,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes
1075,MRK,1,NRSV,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth
1076,MRK,1,NRSV,have you come to destroy us
1077,MRK,1,NRSV,i know who you are the holy one of god
1078,MRK,1,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him and the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him
1079,MRK,1,NRSV,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this
1080,MRK,1,NRSV,a new teachingwith authority he commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him
1081,MRK,1,NRSV,at once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of galilee
1082,MRK,1,NRSV,as soon as they left the synagogue they entered the house of simon and andrew with james and john
1083,MRK,1,NRSV,now simons motherinlaw was in bed with a fever and they told him about her at once
1084,MRK,1,NRSV,he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up
1085,MRK,1,NRSV,then the fever left her and she began to serve them
1086,MRK,1,NRSV,that evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons
1087,MRK,1,NRSV,and the whole city was gathered around the door
1088,MRK,1,NRSV,and he cured many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons and he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him
1089,MRK,1,NRSV,in the morning while it was still very dark he got up and went out to a deserted place and there he prayed
1090,MRK,1,NRSV,and simon and his companions hunted for him
1091,MRK,1,NRSV,when they found him they said to him everyone is searching for you
1092,MRK,1,NRSV,he answered let us go on to the neighboring towns so that i may proclaim the message there also for that is what i came out to do
1093,MRK,1,NRSV,and he went throughout galilee proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons
1094,MRK,1,NRSV,a leper came to him begging him and kneeling he said to him if you choose you can make me clean
1095,MRK,1,NRSV,moved with pity jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him i do choose
1096,MRK,1,NRSV,be made clean immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean
1097,MRK,1,NRSV,after sternly warning him he sent him away at once saying to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what moses commanded as a testimony to them
1098,MRK,1,NRSV,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter
1099,MRK,2,NRSV,when he returned to capernaum after some days it was reported that he was at home
1100,MRK,2,NRSV,so many gathered around that there was no longer room for them not even in front of the door and he was speaking the word to them
1101,MRK,2,NRSV,then some people came bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four of them
1102,MRK,2,NRSV,and when they could not bring him to jesus because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and after having dug through it they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay
1103,MRK,2,NRSV,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven
1104,MRK,2,NRSV,now some of the scribes were sitting there questioning in their hearts why does this fellow speak in this way
1105,MRK,2,NRSV,it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone
1106,MRK,2,NRSV,at once jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves and he said to them why do you raise such questions in your hearts
1107,MRK,2,NRSV,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk
1108,MRK,2,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralytic i say to you stand up take your mat and go to your home
1109,MRK,2,NRSV,and he stood up and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them so that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we have never seen anything like this jesus went out again beside the sea the whole crowd gathered around him and he taught them
1110,MRK,2,NRSV,as he was walking along he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me
1111,MRK,2,NRSV,and he got up and followed him
1112,MRK,2,NRSV,and as he sat at dinner in levis house many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting with jesus and his disciplesfor there were many who followed him
1113,MRK,2,NRSV,when the scribes of the pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors they said to his disciples why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners
1114,MRK,2,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to them those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners
1115,MRK,2,NRSV,now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting and people came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast
1116,MRK,2,NRSV,jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them can they
1117,MRK,2,NRSV,as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
1118,MRK,2,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast on that day
1119,MRK,2,NRSV,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak otherwise the patch pulls away from it the new from the old and a worse tear is made
1120,MRK,2,NRSV,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost and so are the skins but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins
1121,MRK,2,NRSV,one sabbath he was going through the grainfields and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain
1122,MRK,2,NRSV,the pharisees said to him look why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath
1123,MRK,2,NRSV,and he said to them have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food
1124,MRK,2,NRSV,he entered the house of god when abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the presence which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and he gave some to his companions
1125,MRK,2,NRSV,then he said to them the sabbath was made for humankind and not humankind for the sabbath so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
1126,MRK,3,NRSV,again he entered the synagogue and a man was there who had a withered hand
1127,MRK,3,NRSV,they watched him to see whether he would cure him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him
1128,MRK,3,NRSV,and he said to the man who had the withered hand come forward
1129,MRK,3,NRSV,then he said to them is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to kill
1130,MRK,3,NRSV,but they were silent
1131,MRK,3,NRSV,he looked around at them with anger he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man stretch out your hand
1132,MRK,3,NRSV,he stretched it out and his hand was restored
1133,MRK,3,NRSV,the pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the herodians against him how to destroy him
1134,MRK,3,NRSV,jesus departed with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him hearing all that he was doing they came to him in great numbers from judea jerusalem idumea beyond the jordan and the region around tyre and sidon
1135,MRK,3,NRSV,he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd so that they would not crush him for he had cured many so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him
1136,MRK,3,NRSV,whenever the unclean spirits saw him they fell down before him and shouted you are the son of god but he sternly ordered them not to make him known
1137,MRK,3,NRSV,he went up the mountain and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him
1138,MRK,3,NRSV,and he appointed twelve whom he also named apostles to be with him and to be sent out to proclaim the message and to have authority to cast out demons
1139,MRK,3,NRSV,so he appointed the twelve simon to whom he gave the name peter james son of zebedee and john the brother of james to whom he gave the name boanerges that is sons of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the cananaean and judas iscariot who betrayed him
1140,MRK,3,NRSV,then he went home and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat
1141,MRK,3,NRSV,when his family heard it they went out to restrain him for people were saying he has gone out of his mind
1142,MRK,3,NRSV,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons
1143,MRK,3,NRSV,and he called them to him and spoke to them in parables how can satan cast out satan
1144,MRK,3,NRSV,if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
1145,MRK,3,NRSV,and if a house is divided against itself that house will not be able to stand
1146,MRK,3,NRSV,and if satan has risen up against himself and is divided he cannot stand but his end has come
1147,MRK,3,NRSV,but no one can enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man then indeed the house can be plundered
1148,MRK,3,NRSV,truly i tell you people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit can never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin for they had said he has an unclean spirit
1149,MRK,3,NRSV,then his mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent to him and called him
1150,MRK,3,NRSV,a crowd was sitting around him and they said to him your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside asking for you
1151,MRK,3,NRSV,and he replied who are my mother and my brothers
1152,MRK,3,NRSV,and looking at those who sat around him he said here are my mother and my brothers whoever does the will of god is my brother and sister and mother
1153,MRK,4,NRSV,again he began to teach beside the sea
1154,MRK,4,NRSV,such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land
1155,MRK,4,NRSV,he began to teach them many things in parables and in his teaching he said to them listen a sower went out to sow
1156,MRK,4,NRSV,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up
1157,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and it sprang up quickly since it had no depth of soil
1158,MRK,4,NRSV,and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away
1159,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain
1160,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold
1161,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said let anyone with ears to hear listen when he was alone those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables
1162,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them to you has been given the secret of the kingdom of god but for those outside everything comes in parables in order that they may indeed look but not perceive and may indeed listen but not understand so that they may not turn again and be forgiven
1163,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them do you not understand this parable
1164,MRK,4,NRSV,then how will you understand all the parables
1165,MRK,4,NRSV,the sower sows the word
1166,MRK,4,NRSV,these are the ones on the path where the word is sown when they hear satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them
1167,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on rocky ground when they hear the word they immediately receive it with joy
1168,MRK,4,NRSV,but they have no root and endure only for a while then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word immediately they fall away
1169,MRK,4,NRSV,and others are those sown among the thorns these are the ones who hear the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word and it yields nothing
1170,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on the good soil they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold
1171,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket or under the bed and not on the lampstand
1172,MRK,4,NRSV,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light
1173,MRK,4,NRSV,let anyone with ears to hear listen and he said to them pay attention to what you hear the measure you give will be the measure you get and still more will be given you
1174,MRK,4,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
1175,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how
1176,MRK,4,NRSV,the earth produces of itself first the stalk then the head then the full grain in the head
1177,MRK,4,NRSV,but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come
1178,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it
1179,MRK,4,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade
1180,MRK,4,NRSV,with many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it he did not speak to them except in parables but he explained everything in private to his disciples
1181,MRK,4,NRSV,on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go across to the other side
1182,MRK,4,NRSV,and leaving the crowd behind they took him with them in the boat just as he was
1183,MRK,4,NRSV,other boats were with him
1184,MRK,4,NRSV,a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was already being swamped
1185,MRK,4,NRSV,but he was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are perishing
1186,MRK,4,NRSV,he woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be still then the wind ceased and there was a dead calm
1187,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them why are you afraid
1188,MRK,4,NRSV,have you still no faith
1189,MRK,4,NRSV,and they were filled with great awe and said to one another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
1190,MRK,5,NRSV,they came to the other side of the sea to the country of the gerasenes
1191,MRK,5,NRSV,and when he had stepped out of the boat immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him
1192,MRK,5,NRSV,he lived among the tombs and no one could restrain him any more even with a chain for he had often been restrained with shackles and chains but the chains he wrenched apart and the shackles he broke in pieces and no one had the strength to subdue him
1193,MRK,5,NRSV,night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always howling and bruising himself with stones
1194,MRK,5,NRSV,when he saw jesus from a distance he ran and bowed down before him and he shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god
1195,MRK,5,NRSV,i adjure you by god do not torment me
1196,MRK,5,NRSV,for he had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit then jesus asked him what is your name
1197,MRK,5,NRSV,he replied my name is legion for we are many
1198,MRK,5,NRSV,he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country
1199,MRK,5,NRSV,now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding and the unclean spirits begged him send us into the swine let us enter them
1200,MRK,5,NRSV,so he gave them permission
1201,MRK,5,NRSV,and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine and the herd numbering about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea
1202,MRK,5,NRSV,the swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country
1203,MRK,5,NRSV,then people came to see what it was that had happened
1204,MRK,5,NRSV,they came to jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind the very man who had had the legion and they were afraid
1205,MRK,5,NRSV,those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it
1206,MRK,5,NRSV,then they began to beg jesus to leave their neighborhood
1207,MRK,5,NRSV,as he was getting into the boat the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him
1208,MRK,5,NRSV,but jesus refused and said to him go home to your friends and tell them how much the lord has done for you and what mercy he has shown you
1209,MRK,5,NRSV,and he went away and began to proclaim in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed
1210,MRK,5,NRSV,when jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side a great crowd gathered around him and he was by the sea
1211,MRK,5,NRSV,then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly my little daughter is at the point of death
1212,MRK,5,NRSV,come and lay your hands on her so that she may be made well and live
1213,MRK,5,NRSV,so he went with him
1214,MRK,5,NRSV,and a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him
1215,MRK,5,NRSV,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years
1216,MRK,5,NRSV,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse
1217,MRK,5,NRSV,she had heard about jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak for she said if i but touch his clothes i will be made well
1218,MRK,5,NRSV,immediately her hemorrhage stopped and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease
1219,MRK,5,NRSV,immediately aware that power had gone forth from him jesus turned about in the crowd and said who touched my clothes
1220,MRK,5,NRSV,and his disciples said to him you see the crowd pressing in on you how can you say who touched me
1221,MRK,5,NRSV,he looked all around to see who had done it
1222,MRK,5,NRSV,but the woman knowing what had happened to her came in fear and trembling fell down before him and told him the whole truth
1223,MRK,5,NRSV,he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be healed of your disease
1224,MRK,5,NRSV,while he was still speaking some people came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead
1225,MRK,5,NRSV,why trouble the teacher any further
1226,MRK,5,NRSV,but overhearing what they said jesus said to the leader of the synagogue do not fear only believe
1227,MRK,5,NRSV,he allowed no one to follow him except peter james and john the brother of james
1228,MRK,5,NRSV,when they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue he saw a commotion people weeping and wailing loudly
1229,MRK,5,NRSV,when he had entered he said to them why do you make a commotion and weep
1230,MRK,5,NRSV,the child is not dead but sleeping
1231,MRK,5,NRSV,and they laughed at him
1232,MRK,5,NRSV,then he put them all outside and took the childs father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was
1233,MRK,5,NRSV,he took her by the hand and said to her talitha cum which means little girl get up and immediately the girl got up and began to walk about she was twelve years of age
1234,MRK,5,NRSV,at this they were overcome with amazement
1235,MRK,5,NRSV,he strictly ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat
1236,MRK,6,NRSV,he left that place and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him
1237,MRK,6,NRSV,on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astounded
1238,MRK,6,NRSV,they said where did this man get all this
1239,MRK,6,NRSV,what is this wisdom that has been given to him
1240,MRK,6,NRSV,what deeds of power are being done by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us
1241,MRK,6,NRSV,and they took offense at him
1242,MRK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house
1243,MRK,6,NRSV,and he could do no deed of power there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them
1244,MRK,6,NRSV,and he was amazed at their unbelief
1245,MRK,6,NRSV,then he went about among the villages teaching
1246,MRK,6,NRSV,he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits
1247,MRK,6,NRSV,he ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics
1248,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place
1249,MRK,6,NRSV,if any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you as you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them
1250,MRK,6,NRSV,so they went out and proclaimed that all should repent
1251,MRK,6,NRSV,they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them
1252,MRK,6,NRSV,king herod heard of it for jesus name had become known
1253,MRK,6,NRSV,some were saying john the baptizer has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him
1254,MRK,6,NRSV,but others said it is elijah
1255,MRK,6,NRSV,and others said it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old
1256,MRK,6,NRSV,but when herod heard of it he said john whom i beheaded has been raised
1257,MRK,6,NRSV,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod had married her
1258,MRK,6,NRSV,for john had been telling herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
1259,MRK,6,NRSV,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him
1260,MRK,6,NRSV,but she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and he protected him
1261,MRK,6,NRSV,when he heard him he was greatly perplexed and yet he liked to listen to him
1262,MRK,6,NRSV,but an opportunity came when herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of galilee
1263,MRK,6,NRSV,when his daughter herodias came in and danced she pleased herod and his guests and the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you wish and i will give it
1264,MRK,6,NRSV,and he solemnly swore to her whatever you ask me i will give you even half of my kingdom
1265,MRK,6,NRSV,she went out and said to her mother what should i ask for
1266,MRK,6,NRSV,she replied the head of john the baptizer
1267,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately she rushed back to the king and requested i want you to give me at once the head of john the baptist on a platter
1268,MRK,6,NRSV,the king was deeply grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he did not want to refuse her
1269,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring johns head
1270,MRK,6,NRSV,he went and beheaded him in the prison brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl
1271,MRK,6,NRSV,then the girl gave it to her mother
1272,MRK,6,NRSV,when his disciples heard about it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb
1273,MRK,6,NRSV,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught
1274,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while
1275,MRK,6,NRSV,for many were coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat
1276,MRK,6,NRSV,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves
1277,MRK,6,NRSV,now many saw them going and recognized them and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them
1278,MRK,6,NRSV,as he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things
1279,MRK,6,NRSV,when it grew late his disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now very late send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy something for themselves to eat
1280,MRK,6,NRSV,but he answered them you give them something to eat
1281,MRK,6,NRSV,they said to him are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat
1282,MRK,6,NRSV,and he said to them how many loaves have you
1283,MRK,6,NRSV,go and see
1284,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had found out they said five and two fish
1285,MRK,6,NRSV,then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass
1286,MRK,6,NRSV,so they sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties
1287,MRK,6,NRSV,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and he divided the two fish among them all
1288,MRK,6,NRSV,and all ate and were filled and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish
1289,MRK,6,NRSV,those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men
1290,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd
1291,MRK,6,NRSV,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray
1292,MRK,6,NRSV,when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land
1293,MRK,6,NRSV,when he saw that they were straining at the oars against an adverse wind he came towards them early in the morning walking on the sea
1294,MRK,6,NRSV,he intended to pass them by
1295,MRK,6,NRSV,but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and cried out for they all saw him and were terrified
1296,MRK,6,NRSV,but immediately he spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid
1297,MRK,6,NRSV,then he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased
1298,MRK,6,NRSV,and they were utterly astounded for they did not understand about the loaves but their hearts were hardened
1299,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret and moored the boat
1300,MRK,6,NRSV,when they got out of the boat people at once recognized him and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was
1301,MRK,6,NRSV,and wherever he went into villages or cities or farms they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed
1302,MRK,7,NRSV,now when the pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from jerusalem gathered around him they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands that is without washing them
1303,MRK,7,NRSV,for the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands thus observing the tradition of the elders and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it and there are also many other traditions that they observe the washing of cups pots and bronze kettles
1304,MRK,7,NRSV, so the pharisees and the scribes asked him why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders but eat with defiled hands
1305,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to them isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their hearts are far from me in vain do they worship me teaching human precepts as doctrines
1306,MRK,7,NRSV,you abandon the commandment of god and hold to human tradition
1307,MRK,7,NRSV,then he said to them you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition for moses said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die
1308,MRK,7,NRSV,but you say that if anyone tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is corban that is an offering to god then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother thus making void the word of god through your tradition that you have handed on
1309,MRK,7,NRSV,and you do many things like this
1310,MRK,7,NRSV,then he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile
1311,MRK,7,NRSV,when he had left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about the parable
1312,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to them then do you also fail to understand
1313,MRK,7,NRSV,do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile since it enters not the heart but the stomach and goes out into the sewer
1314,MRK,7,NRSV,thus he declared all foods clean and he said it is what comes out of a person that defiles
1315,MRK,7,NRSV,for it is from within from the human heart that evil intentions come fornication theft murder adultery avarice wickedness deceit licentiousness envy slander pride folly
1316,MRK,7,NRSV,all these evil things come from within and they defile a person
1317,MRK,7,NRSV,from there he set out and went away to the region of tyre
1318,MRK,7,NRSV,he entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there
1319,MRK,7,NRSV,yet he could not escape notice but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and she came and bowed down at his feet
1320,MRK,7,NRSV,now the woman was a gentile of syrophoenician origin
1321,MRK,7,NRSV,she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter
1322,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to her let the children be fed first for it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
1323,MRK,7,NRSV,but she answered him sir even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs
1324,MRK,7,NRSV,then he said to her for saying that you may gothe demon has left your daughter
1325,MRK,7,NRSV,so she went home found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone
1326,MRK,7,NRSV,then he returned from the region of tyre and went by way of sidon towards the sea of galilee in the region of the decapolis
1327,MRK,7,NRSV,they brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech and they begged him to lay his hand on him
1328,MRK,7,NRSV,he took him aside in private away from the crowd and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue
1329,MRK,7,NRSV,then looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him ephphatha that is be opened
1330,MRK,7,NRSV,and immediately his ears were opened his tongue was released and he spoke plainly
1331,MRK,7,NRSV,then jesus ordered them to tell no one but the more he ordered them the more zealously they proclaimed it
1332,MRK,7,NRSV,they were astounded beyond measure saying he has done everything well he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak
1333,MRK,8,NRSV,in those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat he called his disciples and said to them i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat
1334,MRK,8,NRSV,if i send them away hungry to their homes they will faint on the wayand some of them have come from a great distance
1335,MRK,8,NRSV,his disciples replied how can one feed these people with bread here in the desert
1336,MRK,8,NRSV,he asked them how many loaves do you have
1337,MRK,8,NRSV,they said seven
1338,MRK,8,NRSV,then he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute and they distributed them to the crowd
1339,MRK,8,NRSV,they had also a few small fish and after blessing them he ordered that these too should be distributed
1340,MRK,8,NRSV,they ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full
1341,MRK,8,NRSV,now there were about four thousand people
1342,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sent them away
1343,MRK,8,NRSV,and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of dalmanutha
1344,MRK,8,NRSV,the pharisees came and began to argue with him asking him for a sign from heaven to test him
1345,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sighed deeply in his spirit and said why does this generation ask for a sign
1346,MRK,8,NRSV,truly i tell you no sign will be given to this generation
1347,MRK,8,NRSV,and he left them and getting into the boat again he went across to the other side
1348,MRK,8,NRSV,now the disciples had forgotten to bring any bread and they had only one loaf with them in the boat
1349,MRK,8,NRSV,and he cautioned them saying watch outbeware of the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod
1350,MRK,8,NRSV,they said to one another it is because we have no bread
1351,MRK,8,NRSV,and becoming aware of it jesus said to them why are you talking about having no bread
1352,MRK,8,NRSV,do you still not perceive or understand
1353,MRK,8,NRSV,are your hearts hardened
1354,MRK,8,NRSV,do you have eyes and fail to see
1355,MRK,8,NRSV,do you have ears and fail to hear
1356,MRK,8,NRSV,and do you not remember
1357,MRK,8,NRSV,when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect
1358,MRK,8,NRSV,they said to him twelve
1359,MRK,8,NRSV,and the seven for the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect
1360,MRK,8,NRSV,and they said to him seven
1361,MRK,8,NRSV,then he said to them do you not yet understand
1362,MRK,8,NRSV,they came to bethsaida
1363,MRK,8,NRSV,some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him
1364,MRK,8,NRSV,he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him can you see anything
1365,MRK,8,NRSV,and the man looked up and said i can see people but they look like trees walking
1366,MRK,8,NRSV,then jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and he looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly
1367,MRK,8,NRSV,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village
1368,MRK,8,NRSV,jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of caesarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples who do people say that i am
1369,MRK,8,NRSV,and they answered him john the baptist and others elijah and still others one of the prophets
1370,MRK,8,NRSV,he asked them but who do you say that i am
1371,MRK,8,NRSV,peter answered him you are the messiah
1372,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him
1373,MRK,8,NRSV,then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
1374,MRK,8,NRSV,he said all this quite openly
1375,MRK,8,NRSV,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him
1376,MRK,8,NRSV,but turning and looking at his disciples he rebuked peter and said get behind me satan for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things
1377,MRK,8,NRSV,he called the crowd with his disciples and said to them if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me
1378,MRK,8,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel will save it
1379,MRK,8,NRSV,for what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life
1380,MRK,8,NRSV,indeed what can they give in return for their life
1381,MRK,8,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of them the son of man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
1382,MRK,9,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of god has come with power
1383,MRK,9,NRSV,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and john and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves
1384,MRK,9,NRSV,and he was transfigured before them and his clothes became dazzling white such as no one on earth could bleach them
1385,MRK,9,NRSV,and there appeared to them elijah with moses who were talking with jesus
1386,MRK,9,NRSV,then peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijah
1387,MRK,9,NRSV,he did not know what to say for they were terrified
1388,MRK,9,NRSV,then a cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud there came a voice this is my son the beloved listen to him suddenly when they looked around they saw no one with them any more but only jesus
1389,MRK,9,NRSV,as they were coming down the mountain he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen until after the son of man had risen from the dead
1390,MRK,9,NRSV,so they kept the matter to themselves questioning what this rising from the dead could mean
1391,MRK,9,NRSV,then they asked him why do the scribes say that elijah must come first
1392,MRK,9,NRSV,he said to them elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things
1393,MRK,9,NRSV,how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt
1394,MRK,9,NRSV,but i tell you that elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased as it is written about him
1395,MRK,9,NRSV,when they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them
1396,MRK,9,NRSV,when the whole crowd saw him they were immediately overcome with awe and they ran forward to greet him
1397,MRK,9,NRSV,he asked them what are you arguing about with them
1398,MRK,9,NRSV,someone from the crowd answered him teacher i brought you my son he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak and whenever it seizes him it dashes him down and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid and i asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do so
1399,MRK,9,NRSV,he answered them you faithless generation how much longer must i be among you
1400,MRK,9,NRSV,how much longer must i put up with you
1401,MRK,9,NRSV,bring him to me
1402,MRK,9,NRSV,and they brought the boy to him
1403,MRK,9,NRSV,when the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy and he fell on the ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth
1404,MRK,9,NRSV,jesus asked the father how long has this been happening to him
1405,MRK,9,NRSV,and he said from childhood
1406,MRK,9,NRSV,it has often cast him into the fire and into the water to destroy him but if you are able to do anything have pity on us and help us
1407,MRK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him if you are ableall things can be done for the one who believes
1408,MRK,9,NRSV,immediately the father of the child cried out i believe help my unbelief when jesus saw that a crowd came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it you spirit that keeps this boy from speaking and hearing i command you come out of him and never enter him again after crying out and convulsing him terribly it came out and the boy was like a corpse so that most of them said he is dead
1409,MRK,9,NRSV,but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he was able to stand
1410,MRK,9,NRSV,when he had entered the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast it out
1411,MRK,9,NRSV,he said to them this kind can come out only through prayer
1412,MRK,9,NRSV,they went on from there and passed through galilee
1413,MRK,9,NRSV,he did not want anyone to know it for he was teaching his disciples saying to them the son of man is to be betrayed into human hands and they will kill him and three days after being killed he will rise again
1414,MRK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him
1415,MRK,9,NRSV,then they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them what were you arguing about on the way
1416,MRK,9,NRSV,but they were silent for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest
1417,MRK,9,NRSV,he sat down called the twelve and said to them whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all
1418,MRK,9,NRSV,then he took a little child and put it among them and taking it in his arms he said to them whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me
1419,MRK,9,NRSV,john said to him teacher we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he was not following us
1420,MRK,9,NRSV,but jesus said do not stop him for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me
1421,MRK,9,NRSV,whoever is not against us is for us
1422,MRK,9,NRSV,for truly i tell you whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of christ will by no means lose the reward
1423,MRK,9,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea
1424,MRK,9,NRSV,if your hand causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell to the unquenchable fire
1425,MRK,9,NRSV,and if your foot causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell
1426,MRK,9,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched
1427,MRK,9,NRSV,for everyone will be salted with fire
1428,MRK,9,NRSV,salt is good but if salt has lost its saltiness how can you season it
1429,MRK,9,NRSV,have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another
1430,MRK,10,NRSV,he left that place and went to the region of judea and beyond the jordan
1431,MRK,10,NRSV,and crowds again gathered around him and as was his custom he again taught them
1432,MRK,10,NRSV,some pharisees came and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife
1433,MRK,10,NRSV,he answered them what did moses command you
1434,MRK,10,NRSV,they said moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her
1435,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you
1436,MRK,10,NRSV,but from the beginning of creation god made them male and female
1437,MRK,10,NRSV,for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
1438,MRK,10,NRSV,so they are no longer two but one flesh
1439,MRK,10,NRSV,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate
1440,MRK,10,NRSV,then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter
1441,MRK,10,NRSV,he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery
1442,MRK,10,NRSV,people were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them and the disciples spoke sternly to them
1443,MRK,10,NRSV,but when jesus saw this he was indignant and said to them let the little children come to me do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs
1444,MRK,10,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it
1445,MRK,10,NRSV,and he took them up in his arms laid his hands on them and blessed them
1446,MRK,10,NRSV,as he was setting out on a journey a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
1447,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good
1448,MRK,10,NRSV,no one is good but god alone
1449,MRK,10,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness you shall not defraud honor your father and mother
1450,MRK,10,NRSV,he said to him teacher i have kept all these since my youth
1451,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus looking at him loved him and said you lack one thing go sell what you own and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
1452,MRK,10,NRSV,when he heard this he was shocked and went away grieving for he had many possessions
1453,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god and the disciples were perplexed at these words
1454,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them again children how hard it is to enter the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
1455,MRK,10,NRSV,they were greatly astounded and said to one another then who can be saved
1456,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but not for god for god all things are possible
1457,MRK,10,NRSV,peter began to say to him look we have left everything and followed you
1458,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not receive a hundredfold now in this agehouses brothers and sisters mothers and children and fields with persecutionsand in the age to come eternal life
1459,MRK,10,NRSV,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first
1460,MRK,10,NRSV,they were on the road going up to jerusalem and jesus was walking ahead of them they were amazed and those who followed were afraid
1461,MRK,10,NRSV,he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him saying see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles they will mock him and spit upon him and flog him and kill him and after three days he will rise again
1462,MRK,10,NRSV,james and john the sons of zebedee came forward to him and said to him teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you
1463,MRK,10,NRSV,and he said to them what is it you want me to do for you
1464,MRK,10,NRSV,and they said to him grant us to sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
1465,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them you do not know what you are asking
1466,MRK,10,NRSV,are you able to drink the cup that i drink or be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
1467,MRK,10,NRSV,they replied we are able
1468,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus said to them the cup that i drink you will drink and with the baptism with which i am baptized you will be baptized but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant but it is for those for whom it has been prepared
1469,MRK,10,NRSV,when the ten heard this they began to be angry with james and john
1470,MRK,10,NRSV,so jesus called them and said to them you know that among the gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them
1471,MRK,10,NRSV,but it is not so among you but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all
1472,MRK,10,NRSV,for the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
1473,MRK,10,NRSV,they came to jericho
1474,MRK,10,NRSV,as he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving jericho bartimaeus son of timaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside
1475,MRK,10,NRSV,when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to shout out and say jesus son of david have mercy on me many sternly ordered him to be quiet but he cried out even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and said call him here
1476,MRK,10,NRSV,and they called the blind man saying to him take heart get up he is calling you
1477,MRK,10,NRSV,so throwing off his cloak he sprang up and came to jesus
1478,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus said to him what do you want me to do for you
1479,MRK,10,NRSV,the blind man said to him my teacher let me see again
1480,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him go your faith has made you well
1481,MRK,10,NRSV,immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way
1482,MRK,11,NRSV,when they were approaching jerusalem at bethphage and bethany near the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it
1483,MRK,11,NRSV,if anyone says to you why are you doing this
1484,MRK,11,NRSV,just say this the lord needs it and will send it back here immediately
1485,MRK,11,NRSV,they went away and found a colt tied near a door outside in the street
1486,MRK,11,NRSV,as they were untying it some of the bystanders said to them what are you doing untying the colt
1487,MRK,11,NRSV,they told them what jesus had said and they allowed them to take it
1488,MRK,11,NRSV,then they brought the colt to jesus and threw their cloaks on it and he sat on it
1489,MRK,11,NRSV,many people spread their cloaks on the road and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields
1490,MRK,11,NRSV,then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor david hosanna in the highest heaven then he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve
1491,MRK,11,NRSV,on the following day when they came from bethany he was hungry
1492,MRK,11,NRSV,seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf he went to see whether perhaps he would find anything on it
1493,MRK,11,NRSV,when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
1494,MRK,11,NRSV,he said to it may no one ever eat fruit from you again
1495,MRK,11,NRSV,and his disciples heard it
1496,MRK,11,NRSV,then they came to jerusalem
1497,MRK,11,NRSV,and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple
1498,MRK,11,NRSV,he was teaching and saying is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations
1499,MRK,11,NRSV,but you have made it a den of robbers
1500,MRK,11,NRSV,and when the chief priests and the scribes heard it they kept looking for a way to kill him for they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching
1501,MRK,11,NRSV,and when evening came jesus and his disciples went out of the city
1502,MRK,11,NRSV,in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots
1503,MRK,11,NRSV,then peter remembered and said to him rabbi look the fig tree that you cursed has withered
1504,MRK,11,NRSV,jesus answered them have faith in god
1505,MRK,11,NRSV,truly i tell you if you say to this mountain be taken up and thrown into the sea and if you do not doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass it will be done for you
1506,MRK,11,NRSV,so i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours
1507,MRK,11,NRSV,whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses
1508,MRK,11,NRSV,again they came to jerusalem
1509,MRK,11,NRSV,as he was walking in the temple the chief priests the scribes and the elders came to him and said by what authority are you doing these things
1510,MRK,11,NRSV,who gave you this authority to do them
1511,MRK,11,NRSV,jesus said to them i will ask you one question answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
1512,MRK,11,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin
1513,MRK,11,NRSV,answer me
1514,MRK,11,NRSV,they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not believe him
1515,MRK,11,NRSV,but shall we say of human originthey were afraid of the crowd for all regarded john as truly a prophet
1516,MRK,11,NRSV,so they answered jesus we do not know
1517,MRK,11,NRSV,and jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things
1518,MRK,12,NRSV,then he began to speak to them in parables
1519,MRK,12,NRSV,a man planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a pit for the wine press and built a watchtower then he leased it to tenants and went to another country
1520,MRK,12,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard
1521,MRK,12,NRSV,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded
1522,MRK,12,NRSV,and again he sent another slave to them this one they beat over the head and insulted
1523,MRK,12,NRSV,then he sent another and that one they killed
1524,MRK,12,NRSV,and so it was with many others some they beat and others they killed
1525,MRK,12,NRSV,he had still one other a beloved son
1526,MRK,12,NRSV,finally he sent him to them saying they will respect my son
1527,MRK,12,NRSV,but those tenants said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours
1528,MRK,12,NRSV,so they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard
1529,MRK,12,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do
1530,MRK,12,NRSV,he will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others
1531,MRK,12,NRSV,have you not read this scripture the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone this was the lords doing and it is amazing in our eyes
1532,MRK,12,NRSV,when they realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowd
1533,MRK,12,NRSV,so they left him and went away
1534,MRK,12,NRSV,then they sent to him some pharisees and some herodians to trap him in what he said
1535,MRK,12,NRSV,and they came and said to him teacher we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with truth
1536,MRK,12,NRSV,is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not
1537,MRK,12,NRSV,should we pay them or should we not
1538,MRK,12,NRSV,but knowing their hypocrisy he said to them why are you putting me to the test
1539,MRK,12,NRSV,bring me a denarius and let me see it
1540,MRK,12,NRSV,and they brought one
1541,MRK,12,NRSV,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title
1542,MRK,12,NRSV,they answered the emperors
1543,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods
1544,MRK,12,NRSV,and they were utterly amazed at him
1545,MRK,12,NRSV,some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question saying teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no child the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
1546,MRK,12,NRSV,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise none of the seven left children
1547,MRK,12,NRSV,last of all the woman herself died
1548,MRK,12,NRSV,in the resurrection whose wife will she be
1549,MRK,12,NRSV,for the seven had married her
1550,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them is not this the reason you are wrong that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god
1551,MRK,12,NRSV,for when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven
1552,MRK,12,NRSV,and as for the dead being raised have you not read in the book of moses in the story about the bush how god said to him i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
1553,MRK,12,NRSV,he is god not of the dead but of the living you are quite wrong
1554,MRK,12,NRSV,one of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well he asked him which commandment is the first of all
1555,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
1556,MRK,12,NRSV,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself
1557,MRK,12,NRSV,there is no other commandment greater than these
1558,MRK,12,NRSV,then the scribe said to him you are right teacher you have truly said that he is one and besides him there is no other and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneselfthis is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
1559,MRK,12,NRSV,when jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god
1560,MRK,12,NRSV,after that no one dared to ask him any question
1561,MRK,12,NRSV,while jesus was teaching in the temple he said how can the scribes say that the messiah is the son of david
1562,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself by the holy spirit declared the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet
1563,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself calls him lord so how can he be his son
1564,MRK,12,NRSV,and the large crowd was listening to him with delight
1565,MRK,12,NRSV,as he taught he said beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers
1566,MRK,12,NRSV,they will receive the greater condemnation
1567,MRK,12,NRSV,he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury
1568,MRK,12,NRSV,many rich people put in large sums
1569,MRK,12,NRSV,a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which are worth a penny
1570,MRK,12,NRSV,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury
1571,MRK,12,NRSV,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on
1572,MRK,13,NRSV,as he came out of the temple one of his disciples said to him look teacher what large stones and what large buildings then jesus asked him do you see these great buildings
1573,MRK,13,NRSV,not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down
1574,MRK,13,NRSV,when he was sitting on the mount of olives opposite the temple peter james john and andrew asked him privately tell us when will this be and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished
1575,MRK,13,NRSV,then jesus began to say to them beware that no one leads you astray
1576,MRK,13,NRSV,many will come in my name and say i am he and they will lead many astray
1577,MRK,13,NRSV,when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed this must take place but the end is still to come
1578,MRK,13,NRSV,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in various places there will be famines
1579,MRK,13,NRSV,this is but the beginning of the birth pangs
1580,MRK,13,NRSV,as for yourselves beware for they will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them
1581,MRK,13,NRSV,and the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations
1582,MRK,13,NRSV,when they bring you to trial and hand you over do not worry beforehand about what you are to say but say whatever is given you at that time for it is not you who speak but the holy spirit
1583,MRK,13,NRSV,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you will be hated by all because of my name
1584,MRK,13,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved
1585,MRK,13,NRSV,but when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat
1586,MRK,13,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days pray that it may not be in winter
1587,MRK,13,NRSV,for in those days there will be suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that god created until now no and never will be
1588,MRK,13,NRSV,and if the lord had not cut short those days no one would be saved but for the sake of the elect whom he chose he has cut short those days
1589,MRK,13,NRSV,and if anyone says to you at that time look here is the messiah or look there he isdo not believe it
1590,MRK,13,NRSV,false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to lead astray if possible the elect
1591,MRK,13,NRSV,but be alert i have already told you everything
1592,MRK,13,NRSV,but in those days after that suffering the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in the heavens will be shaken
1593,MRK,13,NRSV,then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
1594,MRK,13,NRSV,then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven
1595,MRK,13,NRSV,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near
1596,MRK,13,NRSV,so also when you see these things taking place you know that he is near at the very gates
1597,MRK,13,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place
1598,MRK,13,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
1599,MRK,13,NRSV,but about that day or hour no one knows neither the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father
1600,MRK,13,NRSV,beware keep alert for you do not know when the time will come
1601,MRK,13,NRSV,it is like a man going on a journey when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge each with his work and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch
1602,MRK,13,NRSV,therefore keep awakefor you do not know when the master of the house will come in the evening or at midnight or at cockcrow or at dawn or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly
1603,MRK,13,NRSV,and what i say to you i say to all keep awake
1604,MRK,14,NRSV,it was two days before the passover and the festival of unleavened bread
1605,MRK,14,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him for they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people
1606,MRK,14,NRSV,while he was at bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at the table a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard and she broke open the jar and poured the ointment on his head
1607,MRK,14,NRSV,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way
1608,MRK,14,NRSV,for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor
1609,MRK,14,NRSV,and they scolded her
1610,MRK,14,NRSV,but jesus said let her alone why do you trouble her
1611,MRK,14,NRSV,she has performed a good service for me
1612,MRK,14,NRSV,for you always have the poor with you and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish but you will not always have me
1613,MRK,14,NRSV,she has done what she could she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial
1614,MRK,14,NRSV,truly i tell you wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her
1615,MRK,14,NRSV,then judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them
1616,MRK,14,NRSV,when they heard it they were greatly pleased and promised to give him money
1617,MRK,14,NRSV,so he began to look for an opportunity to betray him
1618,MRK,14,NRSV,on the first day of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is sacrificed his disciples said to him where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the passover
1619,MRK,14,NRSV,so he sent two of his disciples saying to them go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him and wherever he enters say to the owner of the house the teacher asks where is my guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
1620,MRK,14,NRSV,he will show you a large room upstairs furnished and ready
1621,MRK,14,NRSV,make preparations for us there
1622,MRK,14,NRSV,so the disciples set out and went to the city and found everything as he had told them and they prepared the passover meal
1623,MRK,14,NRSV,when it was evening he came with the twelve
1624,MRK,14,NRSV,and when they had taken their places and were eating jesus said truly i tell you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me
1625,MRK,14,NRSV,they began to be distressed and to say to him one after another surely not i
1626,MRK,14,NRSV,he said to them it is one of the twelve one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me
1627,MRK,14,NRSV,for the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born
1628,MRK,14,NRSV,while they were eating he took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to them and said take this is my body
1629,MRK,14,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them and all of them drank from it
1630,MRK,14,NRSV,he said to them this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many
1631,MRK,14,NRSV,truly i tell you i will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god
1632,MRK,14,NRSV,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives
1633,MRK,14,NRSV,and jesus said to them you will all become deserters for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered
1634,MRK,14,NRSV,but after i am raised up i will go before you to galilee
1635,MRK,14,NRSV,peter said to him even though all become deserters i will not
1636,MRK,14,NRSV,jesus said to him truly i tell you this day this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times
1637,MRK,14,NRSV,but he said vehemently even though i must die with you i will not deny you
1638,MRK,14,NRSV,and all of them said the same
1639,MRK,14,NRSV,they went to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i pray
1640,MRK,14,NRSV,he took with him peter and james and john and began to be distressed and agitated
1641,MRK,14,NRSV,and he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and keep awake
1642,MRK,14,NRSV,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
1643,MRK,14,NRSV,he said abba father for you all things are possible remove this cup from me yet not what i want but what you want
1644,MRK,14,NRSV,he came and found them sleeping and he said to peter simon are you asleep
1645,MRK,14,NRSV,could you not keep awake one hour
1646,MRK,14,NRSV,keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
1647,MRK,14,NRSV,and again he went away and prayed saying the same words
1648,MRK,14,NRSV,and once more he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they did not know what to say to him
1649,MRK,14,NRSV,he came a third time and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest
1650,MRK,14,NRSV,enough the hour has come the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
1651,MRK,14,NRSV,get up let us be going
1652,MRK,14,NRSV,see my betrayer is at hand
1653,MRK,14,NRSV,immediately while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders
1654,MRK,14,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him and lead him away under guard
1655,MRK,14,NRSV,so when he came he went up to him at once and said rabbi and kissed him
1656,MRK,14,NRSV,then they laid hands on him and arrested him
1657,MRK,14,NRSV,but one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear
1658,MRK,14,NRSV,then jesus said to them have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though i were a bandit
1659,MRK,14,NRSV,day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me
1660,MRK,14,NRSV,but let the scriptures be fulfilled
1661,MRK,14,NRSV,all of them deserted him and fled
1662,MRK,14,NRSV,a certain young man was following him wearing nothing but a linen cloth
1663,MRK,14,NRSV,they caught hold of him but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked
1664,MRK,14,NRSV,they took jesus to the high priest and all the chief priests the elders and the scribes were assembled
1665,MRK,14,NRSV,peter had followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting with the guards warming himself at the fire
1666,MRK,14,NRSV,now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against jesus to put him to death but they found none
1667,MRK,14,NRSV,for many gave false testimony against him and their testimony did not agree
1668,MRK,14,NRSV,some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another not made with hands
1669,MRK,14,NRSV,but even on this point their testimony did not agree
1670,MRK,14,NRSV,then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus have you no answer
1671,MRK,14,NRSV,what is it that they testify against you
1672,MRK,14,NRSV,but he was silent and did not answer
1673,MRK,14,NRSV,again the high priest asked him are you the messiah the son of the blessed one
1674,MRK,14,NRSV,jesus said i am and you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of the power and coming with the clouds of heaven
1675,MRK,14,NRSV,then the high priest tore his clothes and said why do we still need witnesses
1676,MRK,14,NRSV,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision
1677,MRK,14,NRSV,all of them condemned him as deserving death
1678,MRK,14,NRSV,some began to spit on him to blindfold him and to strike him saying to him prophesy the guards also took him over and beat him
1679,MRK,14,NRSV,while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servantgirls of the high priest came by
1680,MRK,14,NRSV,when she saw peter warming himself she stared at him and said you also were with jesus the man from nazareth
1681,MRK,14,NRSV,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about
1682,MRK,14,NRSV,and he went out into the forecourt
1683,MRK,14,NRSV,then the cock crowed
1684,MRK,14,NRSV,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them
1685,MRK,14,NRSV,but again he denied it
1686,MRK,14,NRSV,then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean
1687,MRK,14,NRSV,but he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know this man you are talking about
1688,MRK,14,NRSV,at that moment the cock crowed for the second time
1689,MRK,14,NRSV,then peter remembered that jesus had said to him before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times
1690,MRK,14,NRSV,and he broke down and wept
1691,MRK,15,NRSV,as soon as it was morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council
1692,MRK,15,NRSV,they bound jesus led him away and handed him over to pilate
1693,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews
1694,MRK,15,NRSV,he answered him you say so
1695,MRK,15,NRSV,then the chief priests accused him of many things
1696,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked him again have you no answer
1697,MRK,15,NRSV,see how many charges they bring against you
1698,MRK,15,NRSV,but jesus made no further reply so that pilate was amazed
1699,MRK,15,NRSV,now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them anyone for whom they asked
1700,MRK,15,NRSV,now a man called barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection
1701,MRK,15,NRSV,so the crowd came and began to ask pilate to do for them according to his custom
1702,MRK,15,NRSV,then he answered them do you want me to release for you the king of the jews
1703,MRK,15,NRSV,for he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over
1704,MRK,15,NRSV,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead
1705,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate spoke to them again then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the king of the jews
1706,MRK,15,NRSV,they shouted back crucify him pilate asked them why what evil has he done
1707,MRK,15,NRSV,but they shouted all the more crucify him so pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified
1708,MRK,15,NRSV,then the soldiers led him into the courtyard of the palace that is the governors headquarters and they called together the whole cohort
1709,MRK,15,NRSV,and they clothed him in a purple cloak and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on him
1710,MRK,15,NRSV,and they began saluting him hail king of the jews they struck his head with a reed spat upon him and knelt down in homage to him
1711,MRK,15,NRSV,after mocking him they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him
1712,MRK,15,NRSV,then they led him out to crucify him
1713,MRK,15,NRSV,they compelled a passerby who was coming in from the country to carry his cross it was simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus
1714,MRK,15,NRSV,then they brought jesus to the place called golgotha which means the place of a skull
1715,MRK,15,NRSV,and they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it
1716,MRK,15,NRSV,and they crucified him and divided his clothes among them casting lots to decide what each should take
1717,MRK,15,NRSV,it was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him
1718,MRK,15,NRSV,the inscription of the charge against him read the king of the jews
1719,MRK,15,NRSV,and with him they crucified two bandits one on his right and one on his left
1720,MRK,15,NRSV,those who passed by derided him shaking their heads and saying aha you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself and come down from the cross in the same way the chief priests along with the scribes were also mocking him among themselves and saying he saved others he cannot save himself
1721,MRK,15,NRSV,let the messiah the king of israel come down from the cross now so that we may see and believe
1722,MRK,15,NRSV,those who were crucified with him also taunted him
1723,MRK,15,NRSV,when it was noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon
1724,MRK,15,NRSV,at three oclock jesus cried out with a loud voice eloi eloi lema sabachthani
1725,MRK,15,NRSV,which means my god my god why have you forsaken me
1726,MRK,15,NRSV,when some of the bystanders heard it they said listen he is calling for elijah
1727,MRK,15,NRSV,and someone ran filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink saying wait let us see whether elijah will come to take him down
1728,MRK,15,NRSV,then jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last
1729,MRK,15,NRSV,and the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
1730,MRK,15,NRSV,now when the centurion who stood facing him saw that in this way he breathed his last he said truly this man was gods son there were also women looking on from a distance among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the younger and of joses and salome
1731,MRK,15,NRSV,these used to follow him and provided for him when he was in galilee and there were many other women who had come up with him to jerusalem
1732,MRK,15,NRSV,when evening had come and since it was the day of preparation that is the day before the sabbath joseph of arimathea a respected member of the council who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god went boldly to pilate and asked for the body of jesus
1733,MRK,15,NRSV,then pilate wondered if he were already dead and summoning the centurion he asked him whether he had been dead for some time
1734,MRK,15,NRSV,when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the body to joseph
1735,MRK,15,NRSV,then joseph bought a linen cloth and taking down the body wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock
1736,MRK,15,NRSV,he then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb
1737,MRK,15,NRSV,mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw where the body was laid
1738,MRK,16,NRSV,when the sabbath was over mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him
1739,MRK,16,NRSV,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb
1740,MRK,16,NRSV,they had been saying to one another who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb
1741,MRK,16,NRSV,when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled back
1742,MRK,16,NRSV,as they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed
1743,MRK,16,NRSV,but he said to them do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified
1744,MRK,16,NRSV,he has been raised he is not here
1745,MRK,16,NRSV,look there is the place they laid him
1746,MRK,16,NRSV,but go tell his disciples and peter that he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him just as he told you
1747,MRK,16,NRSV,so they went out and fled from the tomb for terror and amazement had seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid
1748,MRK,16,NRSV,and all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around peter
1749,MRK,16,NRSV,and afterward jesus himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation
1750,MRK,16,NRSV,now after he rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons
1751,MRK,16,NRSV,she went out and told those who had been with him while they were mourning and weeping
1752,MRK,16,NRSV,but when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they would not believe it
1753,MRK,16,NRSV,after this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country
1754,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them
1755,MRK,16,NRSV,later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen
1756,MRK,16,NRSV,and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation
1757,MRK,16,NRSV,the one who believes and is baptized will be saved but the one who does not believe will be condemned
1758,MRK,16,NRSV,and these signs will accompany those who believe by using my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes in their hands and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover
1759,MRK,16,NRSV,so then the lord jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god
1760,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere while the lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it
1761,LUK,1,NRSV,since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word i too decided after investigating everything carefully from the very first to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed
1762,LUK,1,NRSV,in the days of king herod of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of abijah
1763,LUK,1,NRSV,his wife was a descendant of aaron and her name was elizabeth
1764,LUK,1,NRSV,both of them were righteous before god living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the lord
1765,LUK,1,NRSV,but they had no children because elizabeth was barren and both were getting on in years
1766,LUK,1,NRSV,once when he was serving as priest before god and his section was on duty he was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to enter the sanctuary of the lord and offer incense
1767,LUK,1,NRSV,now at the time of the incense offering the whole assembly of the people was praying outside
1768,LUK,1,NRSV,then there appeared to him an angel of the lord standing at the right side of the altar of incense
1769,LUK,1,NRSV,when zechariah saw him he was terrified and fear overwhelmed him
1770,LUK,1,NRSV,but the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariah for your prayer has been heard
1771,LUK,1,NRSV,your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you will name him john
1772,LUK,1,NRSV,you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth for he will be great in the sight of the lord
1773,LUK,1,NRSV,he must never drink wine or strong drink even before his birth he will be filled with the holy spirit
1774,LUK,1,NRSV,he will turn many of the people of israel to the lord their god
1775,LUK,1,NRSV,with the spirit and power of elijah he will go before him to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the lord
1776,LUK,1,NRSV,zechariah said to the angel how will i know that this is so
1777,LUK,1,NRSV,for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years
1778,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel replied i am gabriel
1779,LUK,1,NRSV,i stand in the presence of god and i have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news
1780,LUK,1,NRSV,but now because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time you will become mute unable to speak until the day these things occur
1781,LUK,1,NRSV,meanwhile the people were waiting for zechariah and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary
1782,LUK,1,NRSV,when he did come out he could not speak to them and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary
1783,LUK,1,NRSV,he kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak
1784,LUK,1,NRSV,when his time of service was ended he went to his home
1785,LUK,1,NRSV,after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and for five months she remained in seclusion
1786,LUK,1,NRSV,she said this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people
1787,LUK,1,NRSV,in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent by god to a town in galilee called nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david
1788,LUK,1,NRSV,the virgins name was mary
1789,LUK,1,NRSV,and he came to her and said greetings favored one the lord is with you
1790,LUK,1,NRSV,but she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be
1791,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel said to her do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god
1792,LUK,1,NRSV,and now you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will name him jesus
1793,LUK,1,NRSV,he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his ancestor david
1794,LUK,1,NRSV,he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
1795,LUK,1,NRSV,mary said to the angel how can this be since i am a virgin
1796,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel said to her the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be holy he will be called son of god
1797,LUK,1,NRSV,and now your relative elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren
1798,LUK,1,NRSV,for nothing will be impossible with god
1799,LUK,1,NRSV,then mary said here am i the servant of the lord let it be with me according to your word
1800,LUK,1,NRSV,then the angel departed from her
1801,LUK,1,NRSV,in those days mary set out and went with haste to a judean town in the hill country where she entered the house of zechariah and greeted elizabeth
1802,LUK,1,NRSV,when elizabeth heard marys greeting the child leaped in her womb
1803,LUK,1,NRSV,and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb
1804,LUK,1,NRSV,and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me
1805,LUK,1,NRSV,for as soon as i heard the sound of your greeting the child in my womb leaped for joy
1806,LUK,1,NRSV,and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the lord
1807,LUK,1,NRSV,and mary said my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant
1808,LUK,1,NRSV,surely from now on all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me and holy is his name
1809,LUK,1,NRSV,his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation
1810,LUK,1,NRSV,he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts
1811,LUK,1,NRSV,he has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty
1812,LUK,1,NRSV,he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy according to the promise he made to our ancestors to abraham and to his descendants forever
1813,LUK,1,NRSV,and mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home
1814,LUK,1,NRSV,now the time came for elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son
1815,LUK,1,NRSV,her neighbors and relatives heard that the lord had shown his great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her
1816,LUK,1,NRSV,on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him zechariah after his father
1817,LUK,1,NRSV,but his mother said no he is to be called john
1818,LUK,1,NRSV,they said to her none of your relatives has this name
1819,LUK,1,NRSV,then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him
1820,LUK,1,NRSV,he asked for a writing tablet and wrote his name is john
1821,LUK,1,NRSV,and all of them were amazed
1822,LUK,1,NRSV,immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed and he began to speak praising god
1823,LUK,1,NRSV,fear came over all their neighbors and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of judea
1824,LUK,1,NRSV,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become
1825,LUK,1,NRSV,for indeed the hand of the lord was with him
1826,LUK,1,NRSV,then his father zechariah was filled with the holy spirit and spoke this prophecy blessed be the lord god of israel for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them
1827,LUK,1,NRSV,he has raised up a mighty savior for us in the house of his servant david as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us
1828,LUK,1,NRSV,thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors and has remembered his holy covenant the oath that he swore to our ancestor abraham to grant us that we being rescued from the hands of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days
1829,LUK,1,NRSV,and you child will be called the prophet of the most high for you will go before the lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins
1830,LUK,1,NRSV,by the tender mercy of our god the dawn from on high will break upon us to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace
1831,LUK,1,NRSV,the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to israel
1832,LUK,2,NRSV,in those days a decree went out from emperor augustus that all the world should be registered
1833,LUK,2,NRSV,this was the first registration and was taken while quirinius was governor of syria
1834,LUK,2,NRSV,all went to their own towns to be registered
1835,LUK,2,NRSV,joseph also went from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to the city of david called bethlehem because he was descended from the house and family of david
1836,LUK,2,NRSV,he went to be registered with mary to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child
1837,LUK,2,NRSV,while they were there the time came for her to deliver her child
1838,LUK,2,NRSV,and she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn
1839,LUK,2,NRSV,in that region there were shepherds living in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night
1840,LUK,2,NRSV,then an angel of the lord stood before them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were terrified
1841,LUK,2,NRSV,but the angel said to them do not be afraid for seei am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people to you is born this day in the city of david a savior who is the messiah the lord
1842,LUK,2,NRSV,this will be a sign for you you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger
1843,LUK,2,NRSV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest heaven and on earth peace among those whom he favors when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another let us go now to bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place which the lord has made known to us
1844,LUK,2,NRSV,so they went with haste and found mary and joseph and the child lying in the manger
1845,LUK,2,NRSV,when they saw this they made known what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them
1846,LUK,2,NRSV,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart
1847,LUK,2,NRSV,the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all they had heard and seen as it had been told them
1848,LUK,2,NRSV,after eight days had passed it was time to circumcise the child and he was called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb
1849,LUK,2,NRSV,when the time came for their purification according to the law of moses they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the lord and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
1850,LUK,2,NRSV,now there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon this man was righteous and devout looking forward to the consolation of israel and the holy spirit rested on him
1851,LUK,2,NRSV,it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the lords messiah
1852,LUK,2,NRSV,guided by the spirit simeon came into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what was customary under the law simeon took him in his arms and praised god saying master now you are dismissing your servant in peace according to your word for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people israel
1853,LUK,2,NRSV,and the childs father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him
1854,LUK,2,NRSV,then simeon blessed them and said to his mother mary this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealedand a sword will pierce your own soul too
1855,LUK,2,NRSV,there was also a prophet anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher
1856,LUK,2,NRSV,she was of a great age having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage then as a widow to the age of eightyfour
1857,LUK,2,NRSV,she never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day
1858,LUK,2,NRSV,at that moment she came and began to praise god and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of jerusalem
1859,LUK,2,NRSV,when they had finished everything required by the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth
1860,LUK,2,NRSV,the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom and the favor of god was upon him
1861,LUK,2,NRSV,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover
1862,LUK,2,NRSV,and when he was twelve years old they went up as usual for the festival
1863,LUK,2,NRSV,when the festival was ended and they started to return the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but his parents did not know it
1864,LUK,2,NRSV,assuming that he was in the group of travelers they went a days journey
1865,LUK,2,NRSV,then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends
1866,LUK,2,NRSV,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him
1867,LUK,2,NRSV,after three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions
1868,LUK,2,NRSV,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers
1869,LUK,2,NRSV,when his parents saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him child why have you treated us like this
1870,LUK,2,NRSV,look your father and i have been searching for you in great anxiety
1871,LUK,2,NRSV,he said to them why were you searching for me
1872,LUK,2,NRSV,did you not know that i must be in my fathers house
1873,LUK,2,NRSV,but they did not understand what he said to them
1874,LUK,2,NRSV,then he went down with them and came to nazareth and was obedient to them
1875,LUK,2,NRSV,his mother treasured all these things in her heart
1876,LUK,2,NRSV,and jesus increased in wisdom and in years and in divine and human favor
1877,LUK,3,NRSV,in the fifteenth year of the reign of emperor tiberius when pontius pilate was governor of judea and herod was ruler of galilee and his brother philip ruler of the region of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias ruler of abilene during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came to john son of zechariah in the wilderness
1878,LUK,3,NRSV,he went into all the region around the jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet isaiah the voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight
1879,LUK,3,NRSV,every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
1880,LUK,3,NRSV,john said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come
1881,LUK,3,NRSV,bear fruits worthy of repentance
1882,LUK,3,NRSV,do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham
1883,LUK,3,NRSV,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
1884,LUK,3,NRSV,and the crowds asked him what then should we do
1885,LUK,3,NRSV,in reply he said to them whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none and whoever has food must do likewise
1886,LUK,3,NRSV,even tax collectors came to be baptized and they asked him teacher what should we do
1887,LUK,3,NRSV,he said to them collect no more than the amount prescribed for you
1888,LUK,3,NRSV,soldiers also asked him and we what should we do
1889,LUK,3,NRSV,he said to them do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation and be satisfied with your wages
1890,LUK,3,NRSV,as the people were filled with expectation and all were questioning in their hearts concerning john whether he might be the messiah john answered all of them by saying i baptize you with water but one who is more powerful than i is coming i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals
1891,LUK,3,NRSV,he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire
1892,LUK,3,NRSV,his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire
1893,LUK,3,NRSV,so with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people
1894,LUK,3,NRSV,but herod the ruler who had been rebuked by him because of herodias his brothers wife and because of all the evil things that herod had done added to them all by shutting up john in prison
1895,LUK,3,NRSV,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove
1896,LUK,3,NRSV,and a voice came from heaven you are my son the beloved with you i am well pleased
1897,LUK,3,NRSV,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work
1898,LUK,3,NRSV,he was the son as was thought of joseph son of heli son of matthat son of levi son of melchi son of jannai son of joseph son of mattathias son of amos son of nahum son of esli son of naggai son of maath son of mattathias son of semein son of josech son of joda son of joanan son of rhesa son of zerubbabel son of shealtiel son of neri son of melchi son of addi son of cosam son of elmadam son of er son of joshua son of eliezer son of jorim son of matthat son of levi son of simeon son of judah son of joseph son of jonam son of eliakim son of melea son of menna son of mattatha son of nathan son of david son of jesse son of obed son of boaz son of sala son of nahshon son of amminadab son of admin son of arni son of hezron son of perez son of judah son of jacob son of isaac son of abraham son of terah son of nahor son of serug son of reu son of peleg son of eber son of shelah son of cainan son of arphaxad son of shem son of noah son of lamech son of methuselah son of enoch son of jared son of mahalaleel son of cainan son of enos son of seth son of adam son of god
1899,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness where for forty days he was tempted by the devil
1900,LUK,4,NRSV,he ate nothing at all during those days and when they were over he was famished
1901,LUK,4,NRSV,the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become a loaf of bread
1902,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written one does not live by bread alone
1903,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world
1904,LUK,4,NRSV,and the devil said to him to you i will give their glory and all this authority for it has been given over to me and i give it to anyone i please
1905,LUK,4,NRSV,if you then will worship me it will all be yours
1906,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written worship the lord your god and serve only him
1907,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil took him to jerusalem and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down from here for it is written he will command his angels concerning you to protect you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone
1908,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is said do not put the lord your god to the test
1909,LUK,4,NRSV,when the devil had finished every test he departed from him until an opportune time
1910,LUK,4,NRSV,then jesus filled with the power of the spirit returned to galilee and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country
1911,LUK,4,NRSV,he began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone
1912,LUK,4,NRSV,when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day as was his custom
1913,LUK,4,NRSV,he stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him
1914,LUK,4,NRSV,he unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor
1915,LUK,4,NRSV,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the lords favor
1916,LUK,4,NRSV,and he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down
1917,LUK,4,NRSV,the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
1918,LUK,4,NRSV,then he began to say to them today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing
1919,LUK,4,NRSV,all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth
1920,LUK,4,NRSV,they said is not this josephs son
1921,LUK,4,NRSV,he said to them doubtless you will quote to me this proverb doctor cure yourself and you will say do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at capernaum
1922,LUK,4,NRSV,and he said truly i tell you no prophet is accepted in the prophets hometown
1923,LUK,4,NRSV,but the truth is there were many widows in israel in the time of elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months and there was a severe famine over all the land yet elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at zarephath in sidon
1924,LUK,4,NRSV,there were also many lepers in israel in the time of the prophet elisha and none of them was cleansed except naaman the syrian
1925,LUK,4,NRSV,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage
1926,LUK,4,NRSV,they got up drove him out of the town and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff
1927,LUK,4,NRSV,but he passed through the midst of them and went on his way
1928,LUK,4,NRSV,he went down to capernaum a city in galilee and was teaching them on the sabbath
1929,LUK,4,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching because he spoke with authority
1930,LUK,4,NRSV,in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice let us alone what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth
1931,LUK,4,NRSV,have you come to destroy us
1932,LUK,4,NRSV,i know who you are the holy one of god
1933,LUK,4,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm
1934,LUK,4,NRSV,they were all amazed and kept saying to one another what kind of utterance is this
1935,LUK,4,NRSV,for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and out they come and a report about him began to reach every place in the region
1936,LUK,4,NRSV,after leaving the synagogue he entered simons house
1937,LUK,4,NRSV,now simons motherinlaw was suffering from a high fever and they asked him about her
1938,LUK,4,NRSV,then he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her
1939,LUK,4,NRSV,immediately she got up and began to serve them
1940,LUK,4,NRSV,as the sun was setting all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them
1941,LUK,4,NRSV,demons also came out of many shouting you are the son of god but he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the messiah
1942,LUK,4,NRSV,at daybreak he departed and went into a deserted place
1943,LUK,4,NRSV,and the crowds were looking for him and when they reached him they wanted to prevent him from leaving them
1944,LUK,4,NRSV,but he said to them i must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of god to the other cities also for i was sent for this purpose
1945,LUK,4,NRSV,so he continued proclaiming the message in the synagogues of judea
1946,LUK,5,NRSV,once while jesus was standing beside the lake of gennesaret and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of god he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets
1947,LUK,5,NRSV,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore
1948,LUK,5,NRSV,then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat
1949,LUK,5,NRSV,when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch
1950,LUK,5,NRSV,simon answered master we have worked all night long but have caught nothing
1951,LUK,5,NRSV,yet if you say so i will let down the nets
1952,LUK,5,NRSV,when they had done this they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break
1953,LUK,5,NRSV,so they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them
1954,LUK,5,NRSV,and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink
1955,LUK,5,NRSV,but when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying go away from me lord for i am a sinful man for he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken and so also were james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon
1956,LUK,5,NRSV,then jesus said to simon do not be afraid from now on you will be catching people
1957,LUK,5,NRSV,when they had brought their boats to shore they left everything and followed him
1958,LUK,5,NRSV,once when he was in one of the cities there was a man covered with leprosy
1959,LUK,5,NRSV,when he saw jesus he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him lord if you choose you can make me clean
1960,LUK,5,NRSV,then jesus stretched out his hand touched him and said i do choose
1961,LUK,5,NRSV,be made clean
1962,LUK,5,NRSV,immediately the leprosy left him
1963,LUK,5,NRSV,and he ordered him to tell no one
1964,LUK,5,NRSV,go he said and show yourself to the priest and as moses commanded make an offering for your cleansing for a testimony to them
1965,LUK,5,NRSV,but now more than ever the word about jesus spread abroad many crowds would gather to hear him and to be cured of their diseases
1966,LUK,5,NRSV,but he would withdraw to deserted places and pray
1967,LUK,5,NRSV,one day while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting near by they had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal
1968,LUK,5,NRSV,just then some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a bed
1969,LUK,5,NRSV,they were trying to bring him in and lay him before jesus but finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the middle of the crowd in front of jesus
1970,LUK,5,NRSV,when he saw their faith he said friend your sins are forgiven you
1971,LUK,5,NRSV,then the scribes and the pharisees began to question who is this who is speaking blasphemies
1972,LUK,5,NRSV,who can forgive sins but god alone
1973,LUK,5,NRSV,when jesus perceived their questionings he answered them why do you raise such questions in your hearts
1974,LUK,5,NRSV,which is easier to say your sins are forgiven you or to say stand up and walk
1975,LUK,5,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the one who was paralyzedi say to you stand up and take your bed and go to your home
1976,LUK,5,NRSV,immediately he stood up before them took what he had been lying on and went to his home glorifying god
1977,LUK,5,NRSV,amazement seized all of them and they glorified god and were filled with awe saying we have seen strange things today
1978,LUK,5,NRSV,after this he went out and saw a tax collector named levi sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me
1979,LUK,5,NRSV,and he got up left everything and followed him
1980,LUK,5,NRSV,then levi gave a great banquet for him in his house and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them
1981,LUK,5,NRSV,the pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
1982,LUK,5,NRSV,jesus answered those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance
1983,LUK,5,NRSV,then they said to him johns disciples like the disciples of the pharisees frequently fast and pray but your disciples eat and drink
1984,LUK,5,NRSV,jesus said to them you cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them can you
1985,LUK,5,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast in those days
1986,LUK,5,NRSV,he also told them a parable no one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment otherwise the new will be torn and the piece from the new will not match the old
1987,LUK,5,NRSV,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed
1988,LUK,5,NRSV,but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins
1989,LUK,5,NRSV,and no one after drinking old wine desires new wine but says the old is good
1990,LUK,5,NRSV,
1991,LUK,6,NRSV,one sabbath while jesus was going through the grainfields his disciples plucked some heads of grain rubbed them in their hands and ate them
1992,LUK,6,NRSV,but some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath
1993,LUK,6,NRSV,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry
1994,LUK,6,NRSV,he entered the house of god and took and ate the bread of the presence which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and gave some to his companions
1995,LUK,6,NRSV,then he said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath
1996,LUK,6,NRSV,on another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught and there was a man there whose right hand was withered
1997,LUK,6,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees watched him to see whether he would cure on the sabbath so that they might find an accusation against him
1998,LUK,6,NRSV,even though he knew what they were thinking he said to the man who had the withered hand come and stand here
1999,LUK,6,NRSV,he got up and stood there
2000,LUK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them i ask you is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to destroy it
2001,LUK,6,NRSV,after looking around at all of them he said to him stretch out your hand
2002,LUK,6,NRSV,he did so and his hand was restored
2003,LUK,6,NRSV,but they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to jesus
2004,LUK,6,NRSV,now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the night in prayer to god
2005,LUK,6,NRSV,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor
2006,LUK,6,NRSV,he came down with them and stood on a level place with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all judea jerusalem and the coast of tyre and sidon
2007,LUK,6,NRSV,they had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured
2008,LUK,6,NRSV,and all in the crowd were trying to touch him for power came out from him and healed all of them
2009,LUK,6,NRSV,then he looked up at his disciples and said blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god
2010,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who are hungry now for you will be filled
2011,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh
2012,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you revile you and defame you on account of the son of man
2013,LUK,6,NRSV,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets
2014,LUK,6,NRSV,but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation
2015,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you who are full now for you will be hungry
2016,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you who are laughing now for you will mourn and weep
2017,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you when all speak well of you for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets
2018,LUK,6,NRSV,but i say to you that listen love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you
2019,LUK,6,NRSV,if anyone strikes you on the cheek offer the other also and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt
2020,LUK,6,NRSV,give to everyone who begs from you and if anyone takes away your goods do not ask for them again
2021,LUK,6,NRSV,do to others as you would have them do to you
2022,LUK,6,NRSV,if you love those who love you what credit is that to you
2023,LUK,6,NRSV,for even sinners love those who love them
2024,LUK,6,NRSV,if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you
2025,LUK,6,NRSV,for even sinners do the same
2026,LUK,6,NRSV,if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what credit is that to you
2027,LUK,6,NRSV,even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much again
2028,LUK,6,NRSV,but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return
2029,LUK,6,NRSV,your reward will be great and you will be children of the most high for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked
2030,LUK,6,NRSV,be merciful just as your father is merciful
2031,LUK,6,NRSV,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned
2032,LUK,6,NRSV,forgive and you will be forgiven give and it will be given to you
2033,LUK,6,NRSV,a good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap for the measure you give will be the measure you get back
2034,LUK,6,NRSV,he also told them a parable can a blind person guide a blind person
2035,LUK,6,NRSV,will not both fall into a pit
2036,LUK,6,NRSV,a disciple is not above the teacher but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher
2037,LUK,6,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors eye but do not notice the log in your own eye
2038,LUK,6,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor friend let me take out the speck in your eye when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye
2039,LUK,6,NRSV,you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors eye
2040,LUK,6,NRSV,no good tree bears bad fruit nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit for each tree is known by its own fruit
2041,LUK,6,NRSV,figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush
2042,LUK,6,NRSV,the good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks
2043,LUK,6,NRSV,why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i tell you
2044,LUK,6,NRSV,i will show you what someone is like who comes to me hears my words and acts on them
2045,LUK,6,NRSV,that one is like a man building a house who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock when a flood arose the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built
2046,LUK,6,NRSV,but the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation
2047,LUK,6,NRSV,when the river burst against it immediately it fell and great was the ruin of that house
2048,LUK,7,NRSV,after jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum
2049,LUK,7,NRSV,a centurion there had a slave whom he valued highly and who was ill and close to death
2050,LUK,7,NRSV,when he heard about jesus he sent some jewish elders to him asking him to come and heal his slave
2051,LUK,7,NRSV,when they came to jesus they appealed to him earnestly saying he is worthy of having you do this for him for he loves our people and it is he who built our synagogue for us
2052,LUK,7,NRSV,and jesus went with them but when he was not far from the house the centurion sent friends to say to him lord do not trouble yourself for i am not worthy to have you come under my roof therefore i did not presume to come to you
2053,LUK,7,NRSV,but only speak the word and let my servant be healed
2054,LUK,7,NRSV,for i also am a man set under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it
2055,LUK,7,NRSV,when jesus heard this he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd that followed him he said i tell you not even in israel have i found such faith
2056,LUK,7,NRSV,when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the slave in good health
2057,LUK,7,NRSV,soon afterwards he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him
2058,LUK,7,NRSV,as he approached the gate of the town a man who had died was being carried out
2059,LUK,7,NRSV,he was his mothers only son and she was a widow and with her was a large crowd from the town
2060,LUK,7,NRSV,when the lord saw her he had compassion for her and said to her do not weep
2061,LUK,7,NRSV,then he came forward and touched the bier and the bearers stood still
2062,LUK,7,NRSV,and he said young man i say to you rise the dead man sat up and began to speak and jesus gave him to his mother
2063,LUK,7,NRSV,fear seized all of them and they glorified god saying a great prophet has risen among us and god has looked favorably on his people this word about him spread throughout judea and all the surrounding country
2064,LUK,7,NRSV,the disciples of john reported all these things to him
2065,LUK,7,NRSV,so john summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the lord to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another
2066,LUK,7,NRSV,when the men had come to him they said john the baptist has sent us to you to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another
2067,LUK,7,NRSV,jesus had just then cured many people of diseases plagues and evil spirits and had given sight to many who were blind
2068,LUK,7,NRSV,and he answered them go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news brought to them
2069,LUK,7,NRSV,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me
2070,LUK,7,NRSV,when johns messengers had gone jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at
2071,LUK,7,NRSV,a reed shaken by the wind
2072,LUK,7,NRSV,what then did you go out to see
2073,LUK,7,NRSV,someone dressed in soft robes
2074,LUK,7,NRSV,look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces
2075,LUK,7,NRSV,what then did you go out to see
2076,LUK,7,NRSV,a prophet
2077,LUK,7,NRSV,yes i tell you and more than a prophet
2078,LUK,7,NRSV,this is the one about whom it is written see i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you
2079,LUK,7,NRSV,i tell you among those born of women no one is greater than john yet the least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
2080,LUK,7,NRSV,and all the people who heard this including the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of god because they had been baptized with johns baptism
2081,LUK,7,NRSV,but by refusing to be baptized by him the pharisees and the lawyers rejected gods purpose for themselves to what then will i compare the people of this generation and what are they like
2082,LUK,7,NRSV,they are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another we played the flute for you and you did not dance we wailed and you did not weep
2083,LUK,7,NRSV,for john the baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners nevertheless wisdom is vindicated by all her children
2084,LUK,7,NRSV,one of the pharisees asked jesus to eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and took his place at the table
2085,LUK,7,NRSV,and a woman in the city who was a sinner having learned that he was eating in the pharisees house brought an alabaster jar of ointment
2086,LUK,7,NRSV,she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair
2087,LUK,7,NRSV,then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment
2088,LUK,7,NRSV,now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching himthat she is a sinner
2089,LUK,7,NRSV,jesus spoke up and said to him simon i have something to say to you
2090,LUK,7,NRSV,teacher he replied speak
2091,LUK,7,NRSV,a certain creditor had two debtors one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty
2092,LUK,7,NRSV,when they could not pay he canceled the debts for both of them
2093,LUK,7,NRSV,now which of them will love him more
2094,LUK,7,NRSV,simon answered i suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt
2095,LUK,7,NRSV,and jesus said to him you have judged rightly
2096,LUK,7,NRSV,then turning toward the woman he said to simon do you see this woman
2097,LUK,7,NRSV,i entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair
2098,LUK,7,NRSV,you gave me no kiss but from the time i came in she has not stopped kissing my feet
2099,LUK,7,NRSV,you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment
2100,LUK,7,NRSV,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love
2101,LUK,7,NRSV,but the one to whom little is forgiven loves little
2102,LUK,7,NRSV,then he said to her your sins are forgiven
2103,LUK,7,NRSV,but those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves who is this who even forgives sins
2104,LUK,7,NRSV,and he said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace
2105,LUK,8,NRSV,soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god
2106,LUK,8,NRSV,the twelve were with him as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out and joanna the wife of herods steward chuza and susanna and many others who provided for them out of their resources
2107,LUK,8,NRSV,when a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him he said in a parable a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell on the path and was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up
2108,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell on the rock and as it grew up it withered for lack of moisture
2109,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell among thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it
2110,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell into good soil and when it grew it produced a hundredfold
2111,LUK,8,NRSV,as he said this he called out let anyone with ears to hear listen then his disciples asked him what this parable meant
2112,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of god but to others i speak in parables so that looking they may not perceive and listening they may not understand
2113,LUK,8,NRSV,now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
2114,LUK,8,NRSV,the ones on the path are those who have heard then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved
2115,LUK,8,NRSV,the ones on the rock are those who when they hear the word receive it with joy
2116,LUK,8,NRSV,but these have no root they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away
2117,LUK,8,NRSV,as for what fell among the thorns these are the ones who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and their fruit does not mature
2118,LUK,8,NRSV,but as for that in the good soil these are the ones who when they hear the word hold it fast in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patient endurance
2119,LUK,8,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light
2120,LUK,8,NRSV,for nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light
2121,LUK,8,NRSV,then pay attention to how you listen for to those who have more will be given and from those who do not have even what they seem to have will be taken away
2122,LUK,8,NRSV,then his mother and his brothers came to him but they could not reach him because of the crowd
2123,LUK,8,NRSV,and he was told your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you
2124,LUK,8,NRSV,but he said to them my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it
2125,LUK,8,NRSV,one day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go across to the other side of the lake
2126,LUK,8,NRSV,so they put out and while they were sailing he fell asleep
2127,LUK,8,NRSV,a windstorm swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in danger
2128,LUK,8,NRSV,they went to him and woke him up shouting master master we are perishing and he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves they ceased and there was a calm
2129,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to them where is your faith
2130,LUK,8,NRSV,they were afraid and amazed and said to one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him
2131,LUK,8,NRSV,then they arrived at the country of the gerasenes which is opposite galilee
2132,LUK,8,NRSV,as he stepped out on land a man of the city who had demons met him
2133,LUK,8,NRSV,for a long time he had worn no clothes and he did not live in a house but in the tombs
2134,LUK,8,NRSV,when he saw jesus he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god
2135,LUK,8,NRSV,i beg you do not torment me for jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man
2136,LUK,8,NRSV,for many times it had seized him he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds jesus then asked him what is your name
2137,LUK,8,NRSV,he said legion for many demons had entered him
2138,LUK,8,NRSV,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss
2139,LUK,8,NRSV,now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding and the demons begged jesus to let them enter these
2140,LUK,8,NRSV,so he gave them permission
2141,LUK,8,NRSV,then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned
2142,LUK,8,NRSV,when the swineherds saw what had happened they ran off and told it in the city and in the country
2143,LUK,8,NRSV,then people came out to see what had happened and when they came to jesus they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind
2144,LUK,8,NRSV,and they were afraid
2145,LUK,8,NRSV,those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed
2146,LUK,8,NRSV,then all the people of the surrounding country of the gerasenes asked jesus to leave them for they were seized with great fear
2147,LUK,8,NRSV,so he got into the boat and returned
2148,LUK,8,NRSV,the man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying return to your home and declare how much god has done for you
2149,LUK,8,NRSV,so he went away proclaiming throughout the city how much jesus had done for him
2150,LUK,8,NRSV,now when jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all waiting for him
2151,LUK,8,NRSV,just then there came a man named jairus a leader of the synagogue
2152,LUK,8,NRSV,he fell at jesus feet and begged him to come to his house for he had an only daughter about twelve years old who was dying
2153,LUK,8,NRSV,as he went the crowds pressed in on him
2154,LUK,8,NRSV,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years and though she had spent all she had on physicians no one could cure her
2155,LUK,8,NRSV,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped
2156,LUK,8,NRSV,then jesus asked who touched me
2157,LUK,8,NRSV,when all denied it peter said master the crowds surround you and press in on you
2158,LUK,8,NRSV,but jesus said someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me
2159,LUK,8,NRSV,when the woman saw that she could not remain hidden she came trembling and falling down before him she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed
2160,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
2161,LUK,8,NRSV,while he was still speaking someone came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer
2162,LUK,8,NRSV,when jesus heard this he replied do not fear
2163,LUK,8,NRSV,only believe and she will be saved
2164,LUK,8,NRSV,when he came to the house he did not allow anyone to enter with him except peter john and james and the childs father and mother
2165,LUK,8,NRSV,they were all weeping and wailing for her but he said do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping
2166,LUK,8,NRSV,and they laughed at him knowing that she was dead
2167,LUK,8,NRSV,but he took her by the hand and called out child get up her spirit returned and she got up at once
2168,LUK,8,NRSV,then he directed them to give her something to eat
2169,LUK,8,NRSV,her parents were astounded but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened
2170,LUK,9,NRSV,then jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal
2171,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic
2172,LUK,9,NRSV,whatever house you enter stay there and leave from there
2173,LUK,9,NRSV,wherever they do not welcome you as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them
2174,LUK,9,NRSV,they departed and went through the villages bringing the good news and curing diseases everywhere
2175,LUK,9,NRSV,now herod the ruler heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen
2176,LUK,9,NRSV,herod said john i beheaded but who is this about whom i hear such things
2177,LUK,9,NRSV,and he tried to see him
2178,LUK,9,NRSV,on their return the apostles told jesus all they had done
2179,LUK,9,NRSV,he took them with him and withdrew privately to a city called bethsaida
2180,LUK,9,NRSV,when the crowds found out about it they followed him and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and healed those who needed to be cured
2181,LUK,9,NRSV,the day was drawing to a close and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and get provisions for we are here in a deserted place
2182,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said to them you give them something to eat
2183,LUK,9,NRSV,they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people
2184,LUK,9,NRSV,for there were about five thousand men
2185,LUK,9,NRSV,and he said to his disciples make them sit down in groups of about fifty each
2186,LUK,9,NRSV,they did so and made them all sit down
2187,LUK,9,NRSV,and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd
2188,LUK,9,NRSV,and all ate and were filled
2189,LUK,9,NRSV,what was left over was gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces
2190,LUK,9,NRSV,once when jesus was praying alone with only the disciples near him he asked them who do the crowds say that i am
2191,LUK,9,NRSV,they answered john the baptist but others elijah and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen
2192,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am
2193,LUK,9,NRSV,peter answered the messiah of god
2194,LUK,9,NRSV,he sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone saying the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised
2195,LUK,9,NRSV,then he said to them all if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me
2196,LUK,9,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it
2197,LUK,9,NRSV,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves
2198,LUK,9,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words of them the son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels
2199,LUK,9,NRSV,but truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god
2200,LUK,9,NRSV,now about eight days after these sayings jesus took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray
2201,LUK,9,NRSV,and while he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became dazzling white
2202,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him
2203,LUK,9,NRSV,they appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem
2204,LUK,9,NRSV,now peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep but since they had stayed awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him
2205,LUK,9,NRSV,just as they were leaving him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings one for you one for moses and one for elijahnot knowing what he said
2206,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were terrified as they entered the cloud
2207,LUK,9,NRSV,then from the cloud came a voice that said this is my son my chosen listen to him when the voice had spoken jesus was found alone
2208,LUK,9,NRSV,and they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen
2209,LUK,9,NRSV,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him
2210,LUK,9,NRSV,just then a man from the crowd shouted teacher i beg you to look at my son he is my only child
2211,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly a spirit seizes him and all at once he shrieks
2212,LUK,9,NRSV,it convulses him until he foams at the mouth it mauls him and will scarcely leave him
2213,LUK,9,NRSV,i begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not
2214,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you and bear with you
2215,LUK,9,NRSV,bring your son here
2216,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was coming the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions
2217,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father
2218,LUK,9,NRSV,and all were astounded at the greatness of god
2219,LUK,9,NRSV,while everyone was amazed at all that he was doing he said to his disciples let these words sink into your ears the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands
2220,LUK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand this saying its meaning was concealed from them so that they could not perceive it
2221,LUK,9,NRSV,and they were afraid to ask him about this saying
2222,LUK,9,NRSV,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest
2223,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus aware of their inner thoughts took a little child and put it by his side and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for the least among all of you is the greatest
2224,LUK,9,NRSV,john answered master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us
2225,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him do not stop him for whoever is not against you is for you
2226,LUK,9,NRSV,when the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to jerusalem
2227,LUK,9,NRSV,and he sent messengers ahead of him
2228,LUK,9,NRSV,on their way they entered a village of the samaritans to make ready for him but they did not receive him because his face was set toward jerusalem
2229,LUK,9,NRSV,when his disciples james and john saw it they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them
2230,LUK,9,NRSV,but he turned and rebuked them
2231,LUK,9,NRSV,then they went on to another village
2232,LUK,9,NRSV,as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go
2233,LUK,9,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
2234,LUK,9,NRSV,to another he said follow me
2235,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said lord first let me go and bury my father
2236,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him let the dead bury their own dead but as for you go and proclaim the kingdom of god
2237,LUK,9,NRSV,another said i will follow you lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home
2238,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of god
2239,LUK,10,NRSV,after this the lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go
2240,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to them the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
2241,LUK,10,NRSV,go on your way
2242,LUK,10,NRSV,see i am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves
2243,LUK,10,NRSV,carry no purse no bag no sandals and greet no one on the road
2244,LUK,10,NRSV,whatever house you enter first say peace to this house and if anyone is there who shares in peace your peace will rest on that person but if not it will return to you
2245,LUK,10,NRSV,remain in the same house eating and drinking whatever they provide for the laborer deserves to be paid
2246,LUK,10,NRSV,do not move about from house to house
2247,LUK,10,NRSV,whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you eat what is set before you cure the sick who are there and say to them the kingdom of god has come near to you
2248,LUK,10,NRSV,but whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you go out into its streets and say even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you
2249,LUK,10,NRSV,yet know this the kingdom of god has come near
2250,LUK,10,NRSV,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town
2251,LUK,10,NRSV,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes
2252,LUK,10,NRSV,but at the judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you
2253,LUK,10,NRSV,and you capernaum will you be exalted to heaven
2254,LUK,10,NRSV,no you will be brought down to hades
2255,LUK,10,NRSV,whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me
2256,LUK,10,NRSV,the seventy returned with joy saying lord in your name even the demons submit to us he said to them i watched satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning
2257,LUK,10,NRSV,see i have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing will hurt you
2258,LUK,10,NRSV,nevertheless do not rejoice at this that the spirits submit to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven
2259,LUK,10,NRSV,at that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will
2260,LUK,10,NRSV,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father or who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him
2261,LUK,10,NRSV,then turning to the disciples jesus said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it
2262,LUK,10,NRSV,just then a lawyer stood up to test jesus
2263,LUK,10,NRSV,teacher he said what must i do to inherit eternal life
2264,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to him what is written in the law
2265,LUK,10,NRSV,what do you read there
2266,LUK,10,NRSV,he answered you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
2267,LUK,10,NRSV,and he said to him you have given the right answer do this and you will live
2268,LUK,10,NRSV,but wanting to justify himself he asked jesus and who is my neighbor
2269,LUK,10,NRSV,jesus replied a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and fell into the hands of robbers who stripped him beat him and went away leaving him half dead
2270,LUK,10,NRSV,now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
2271,LUK,10,NRSV,so likewise a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side
2272,LUK,10,NRSV,but a samaritan while traveling came near him and when he saw him he was moved with pity
2273,LUK,10,NRSV,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them
2274,LUK,10,NRSV,then he put him on his own animal brought him to an inn and took care of him
2275,LUK,10,NRSV,the next day he took out two denarii gave them to the innkeeper and said take care of him and when i come back i will repay you whatever more you spend
2276,LUK,10,NRSV,which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers
2277,LUK,10,NRSV,he said the one who showed him mercy
2278,LUK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him go and do likewise
2279,LUK,10,NRSV,now as they went on their way he entered a certain village where a woman named martha welcomed him into her home
2280,LUK,10,NRSV,she had a sister named mary who sat at the lords feet and listened to what he was saying
2281,LUK,10,NRSV,but martha was distracted by her many tasks so she came to him and asked lord do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself
2282,LUK,10,NRSV,tell her then to help me
2283,LUK,10,NRSV,but the lord answered her martha martha you are worried and distracted by many things there is need of only one thing
2284,LUK,10,NRSV,mary has chosen the better part which will not be taken away from her
2285,LUK,11,NRSV,he was praying in a certain place and after he had finished one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray as john taught his disciples
2286,LUK,11,NRSV,he said to them when you pray say father hallowed be your name
2287,LUK,11,NRSV,your kingdom come
2288,LUK,11,NRSV,give us each day our daily bread
2289,LUK,11,NRSV,and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us
2290,LUK,11,NRSV,and do not bring us to the time of trial
2291,LUK,11,NRSV,and he said to them suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves of bread for a friend of mine has arrived and i have nothing to set before him
2292,LUK,11,NRSV,and he answers from within do not bother me the door has already been locked and my children are with me in bed i cannot get up and give you anything
2293,LUK,11,NRSV,i tell you even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs
2294,LUK,11,NRSV,so i say to you ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you
2295,LUK,11,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened
2296,LUK,11,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for a fish will give a snake instead of a fish
2297,LUK,11,NRSV,or if the child asks for an egg will give a scorpion
2298,LUK,11,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will the heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask him now he was casting out a demon that was mute when the demon had gone out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed
2299,LUK,11,NRSV,but some of them said he casts out demons by beelzebul the ruler of the demons
2300,LUK,11,NRSV,others to test him kept demanding from him a sign from heaven
2301,LUK,11,NRSV,but he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert and house falls on house
2302,LUK,11,NRSV,if satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand
2303,LUK,11,NRSV,for you say that i cast out the demons by beelzebul
2304,LUK,11,NRSV,now if i cast out the demons by beelzebul by whom do your exorcists cast them out
2305,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore they will be your judges
2306,LUK,11,NRSV,but if it is by the finger of god that i cast out the demons then the kingdom of god has come to you
2307,LUK,11,NRSV,when a strong man fully armed guards his castle his property is safe
2308,LUK,11,NRSV,but when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder
2309,LUK,11,NRSV,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
2310,LUK,11,NRSV,when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but not finding any it says i will return to my house from which i came
2311,LUK,11,NRSV,when it comes it finds it swept and put in order
2312,LUK,11,NRSV,then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first
2313,LUK,11,NRSV,while he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you but he said blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it when the crowds were increasing he began to say this generation is an evil generation it asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah
2314,LUK,11,NRSV,for just as jonah became a sign to the people of nineveh so the son of man will be to this generation
2315,LUK,11,NRSV,the queen of the south will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here no one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light
2316,LUK,11,NRSV,your eye is the lamp of your body
2317,LUK,11,NRSV,if your eye is healthy your whole body is full of light but if it is not healthy your body is full of darkness
2318,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness
2319,LUK,11,NRSV,if then your whole body is full of light with no part of it in darkness it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays
2320,LUK,11,NRSV,while he was speaking a pharisee invited him to dine with him so he went in and took his place at the table
2321,LUK,11,NRSV,the pharisee was amazed to see that he did not first wash before dinner
2322,LUK,11,NRSV,then the lord said to him now you pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside you are full of greed and wickedness
2323,LUK,11,NRSV,you fools did not the one who made the outside make the inside also
2324,LUK,11,NRSV,so give for alms those things that are within and see everything will be clean for you
2325,LUK,11,NRSV,but woe to you pharisees for you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds and neglect justice and the love of god it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others
2326,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you pharisees for you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
2327,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you for you are like unmarked graves and people walk over them without realizing it
2328,LUK,11,NRSV,one of the lawyers answered him teacher when you say these things you insult us too
2329,LUK,11,NRSV,and he said woe also to you lawyers for you load people with burdens hard to bear and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them
2330,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed
2331,LUK,11,NRSV,so you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors for they killed them and you build their tombs
2332,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore also the wisdom of god said i will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and persecute so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary
2333,LUK,11,NRSV,yes i tell you it will be charged against this generation
2334,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not enter yourselves and you hindered those who were entering
2335,LUK,11,NRSV,when he went outside the scribes and the pharisees began to be very hostile toward him and to crossexamine him about many things lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say
2336,LUK,12,NRSV,meanwhile when the crowd gathered by the thousands so that they trampled on one another he began to speak first to his disciples beware of the yeast of the pharisees that is their hypocrisy
2337,LUK,12,NRSV,nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
2338,LUK,12,NRSV,therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops
2339,LUK,12,NRSV,i tell you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after that can do nothing more
2340,LUK,12,NRSV,but i will warn you whom to fear fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell
2341,LUK,12,NRSV,yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies
2342,LUK,12,NRSV,yet not one of them is forgotten in gods sight
2343,LUK,12,NRSV,but even the hairs of your head are all counted
2344,LUK,12,NRSV,do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows
2345,LUK,12,NRSV,and i tell you everyone who acknowledges me before others the son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of god but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of god
2346,LUK,12,NRSV,and everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven
2347,LUK,12,NRSV,when they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say for the holy spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say
2348,LUK,12,NRSV,someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me
2349,LUK,12,NRSV,but he said to him friend who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you
2350,LUK,12,NRSV,and he said to them take care be on your guard against all kinds of greed for ones life does not consist in the abundance of possessions
2351,LUK,12,NRSV,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly
2352,LUK,12,NRSV,and he thought to himself what should i do for i have no place to store my crops
2353,LUK,12,NRSV,then he said i will do this i will pull down my barns and build larger ones and there i will store all my grain and my goods
2354,LUK,12,NRSV,and i will say to my soul soul you have ample goods laid up for many years relax eat drink be merry
2355,LUK,12,NRSV,but god said to him you fool this very night your life is being demanded of you
2356,LUK,12,NRSV,and the things you have prepared whose will they be
2357,LUK,12,NRSV,so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god
2358,LUK,12,NRSV,he said to his disciples therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear
2359,LUK,12,NRSV,for life is more than food and the body more than clothing
2360,LUK,12,NRSV,consider the ravens they neither sow nor reap they have neither storehouse nor barn and yet god feeds them
2361,LUK,12,NRSV,of how much more value are you than the birds and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life
2362,LUK,12,NRSV,if then you are not able to do so small a thing as that why do you worry about the rest
2363,LUK,12,NRSV,consider the lilies how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
2364,LUK,12,NRSV,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying
2365,LUK,12,NRSV,for it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things and your father knows that you need them
2366,LUK,12,NRSV,instead strive for his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well
2367,LUK,12,NRSV,do not be afraid little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
2368,LUK,12,NRSV,sell your possessions and give alms
2369,LUK,12,NRSV,make purses for yourselves that do not wear out an unfailing treasure in heaven where no thief comes near and no moth destroys
2370,LUK,12,NRSV,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
2371,LUK,12,NRSV,be dressed for action and have your lamps lit be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks
2372,LUK,12,NRSV,blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes truly i tell you he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat and he will come and serve them
2373,LUK,12,NRSV,if he comes during the middle of the night or near dawn and finds them so blessed are those slaves
2374,LUK,12,NRSV,but know this if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he would not have let his house be broken into
2375,LUK,12,NRSV,you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour
2376,LUK,12,NRSV,peter said lord are you telling this parable for us or for everyone
2377,LUK,12,NRSV,and the lord said who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves to give them their allowance of food at the proper time
2378,LUK,12,NRSV,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives
2379,LUK,12,NRSV,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions
2380,LUK,12,NRSV,but if that slave says to himself my master is delayed in coming and if he begins to beat the other slaves men and women and to eat and drink and get drunk the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful
2381,LUK,12,NRSV,that slave who knew what his master wanted but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted will receive a severe beating
2382,LUK,12,NRSV,but the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating
2383,LUK,12,NRSV,from everyone to whom much has been given much will be required and from the one to whom much has been entrusted even more will be demanded
2384,LUK,12,NRSV,i came to bring fire to the earth and how i wish it were already kindled i have a baptism with which to be baptized and what stress i am under until it is completed do you think that i have come to bring peace to the earth
2385,LUK,12,NRSV,no i tell you but rather division from now on five in one household will be divided three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw
2386,LUK,12,NRSV,he also said to the crowds when you see a cloud rising in the west you immediately say it is going to rain and so it happens
2387,LUK,12,NRSV,and when you see the south wind blowing you say there will be scorching heat and it happens
2388,LUK,12,NRSV,you hypocrites you know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky but why do you not know how to interpret the present time
2389,LUK,12,NRSV,and why do you not judge for yourselves what is right
2390,LUK,12,NRSV,thus when you go with your accuser before a magistrate on the way make an effort to settle the case or you may be dragged before the judge and the judge hand you over to the officer and the officer throw you in prison
2391,LUK,12,NRSV,i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny
2392,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very time there were some present who told him about the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
2393,LUK,13,NRSV,he asked them do you think that because these galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other galileans
2394,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did
2395,LUK,13,NRSV,or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of siloam fell on themdo you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in jerusalem
2396,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish just as they did
2397,LUK,13,NRSV,then he told this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and found none
2398,LUK,13,NRSV,so he said to the gardener see here for three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and still i find none
2399,LUK,13,NRSV,cut it down why should it be wasting the soil
2400,LUK,13,NRSV,he replied sir let it alone for one more year until i dig around it and put manure on it
2401,LUK,13,NRSV,if it bears fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down
2402,LUK,13,NRSV,now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
2403,LUK,13,NRSV,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years
2404,LUK,13,NRSV,she was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight
2405,LUK,13,NRSV,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment
2406,LUK,13,NRSV,when he laid his hands on her immediately she stood up straight and began praising god
2407,LUK,13,NRSV,but the leader of the synagogue indignant because jesus had cured on the sabbath kept saying to the crowd there are six days on which work ought to be done come on those days and be cured and not on the sabbath day
2408,LUK,13,NRSV,but the lord answered him and said you hypocrites does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water
2409,LUK,13,NRSV,and ought not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day
2410,LUK,13,NRSV,when he said this all his opponents were put to shame and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing
2411,LUK,13,NRSV,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like
2412,LUK,13,NRSV,and to what should i compare it
2413,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made nests in its branches
2414,LUK,13,NRSV,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god
2415,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened
2416,LUK,13,NRSV,jesus went through one town and village after another teaching as he made his way to jerusalem
2417,LUK,13,NRSV,someone asked him lord will only a few be saved
2418,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them strive to enter through the narrow door for many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able
2419,LUK,13,NRSV,when once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying lord open to us then in reply he will say to you i do not know where you come from
2420,LUK,13,NRSV,then you will begin to say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets
2421,LUK,13,NRSV,but he will say i do not know where you come from go away from me all you evildoers there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrown out
2422,LUK,13,NRSV,then people will come from east and west from north and south and will eat in the kingdom of god
2423,LUK,13,NRSV,indeed some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last
2424,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very hour some pharisees came and said to him get away from here for herod wants to kill you
2425,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them go and tell that fox for me listen i am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow and on the third day i finish my work
2426,LUK,13,NRSV,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem
2427,LUK,13,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing see your house is left to you
2428,LUK,13,NRSV,and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
2429,LUK,13,NRSV,
2430,LUK,14,NRSV,on one occasion when jesus was going to the house of a leader of the pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath they were watching him closely
2431,LUK,14,NRSV,just then in front of him there was a man who had dropsy
2432,LUK,14,NRSV,and jesus asked the lawyers and pharisees is it lawful to cure people on the sabbath or not
2433,LUK,14,NRSV,but they were silent
2434,LUK,14,NRSV,so jesus took him and healed him and sent him away
2435,LUK,14,NRSV,then he said to them if one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day
2436,LUK,14,NRSV,and they could not reply to this
2437,LUK,14,NRSV,when he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor he told them a parable
2438,LUK,14,NRSV,when you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet do not sit down at the place of honor in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you give this person your place and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place
2439,LUK,14,NRSV,but when you are invited go and sit down at the lowest place so that when your host comes he may say to you friend move up higher then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you
2440,LUK,14,NRSV,for all who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted
2441,LUK,14,NRSV,he said also to the one who had invited him when you give a luncheon or a dinner do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors in case they may invite you in return and you would be repaid
2442,LUK,14,NRSV,but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame and the blind
2443,LUK,14,NRSV,and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous
2444,LUK,14,NRSV,one of the dinner guests on hearing this said to him blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of god then jesus said to him someone gave a great dinner and invited many
2445,LUK,14,NRSV,at the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited come for everything is ready now
2446,LUK,14,NRSV,but they all alike began to make excuses
2447,LUK,14,NRSV,the first said to him i have bought a piece of land and i must go out and see it please accept my regrets
2448,LUK,14,NRSV,another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i am going to try them out please accept my regrets
2449,LUK,14,NRSV,another said i have just been married and therefore i cannot come
2450,LUK,14,NRSV,so the slave returned and reported this to his master
2451,LUK,14,NRSV,then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame
2452,LUK,14,NRSV,and the slave said sir what you ordered has been done and there is still room
2453,LUK,14,NRSV,then the master said to the slave go out into the roads and lanes and compel people to come in so that my house may be filled
2454,LUK,14,NRSV,for i tell you none of those who were invited will taste my dinner
2455,LUK,14,NRSV,now large crowds were traveling with him and he turned and said to them whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and even life itself cannot be my disciple
2456,LUK,14,NRSV,whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple
2457,LUK,14,NRSV,for which of you intending to build a tower does not first sit down and estimate the cost to see whether he has enough to complete it
2458,LUK,14,NRSV,otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all who see it will begin to ridicule him saying this fellow began to build and was not able to finish
2459,LUK,14,NRSV,or what king going out to wage war against another king will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand
2460,LUK,14,NRSV,if he cannot then while the other is still far away he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace
2461,LUK,14,NRSV,so therefore none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions
2462,LUK,14,NRSV,salt is good but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored
2463,LUK,14,NRSV,it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile they throw it away
2464,LUK,14,NRSV,let anyone with ears to hear listen
2465,LUK,15,NRSV,now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him
2466,LUK,15,NRSV,and the pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying this fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them
2467,LUK,15,NRSV,so he told them this parable which one of you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them does not leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it
2468,LUK,15,NRSV,when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices
2469,LUK,15,NRSV,and when he comes home he calls together his friends and neighbors saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep that was lost
2470,LUK,15,NRSV,just so i tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninetynine righteous persons who need no repentance
2471,LUK,15,NRSV,or what woman having ten silver coins if she loses one of them does not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it
2472,LUK,15,NRSV,when she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the coin that i had lost
2473,LUK,15,NRSV,just so i tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents
2474,LUK,15,NRSV,then jesus said there was a man who had two sons
2475,LUK,15,NRSV,the younger of them said to his father father give me the share of the property that will belong to me
2476,LUK,15,NRSV,so he divided his property between them
2477,LUK,15,NRSV,a few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country and there he squandered his property in dissolute living
2478,LUK,15,NRSV,when he had spent everything a severe famine took place throughout that country and he began to be in need
2479,LUK,15,NRSV,so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs
2480,LUK,15,NRSV,he would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating and no one gave him anything
2481,LUK,15,NRSV,but when he came to himself he said how many of my fathers hired hands have bread enough and to spare but here i am dying of hunger i will get up and go to my father and i will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son treat me like one of your hired hands
2482,LUK,15,NRSV,so he set off and went to his father
2483,LUK,15,NRSV,but while he was still far off his father saw him and was filled with compassion he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him
2484,LUK,15,NRSV,then the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son
2485,LUK,15,NRSV,but the father said to his slaves quickly bring out a robethe best oneand put it on him put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet
2486,LUK,15,NRSV,and get the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to celebrate
2487,LUK,15,NRSV,now his elder son was in the field and when he came and approached the house he heard music and dancing
2488,LUK,15,NRSV,he called one of the slaves and asked what was going on
2489,LUK,15,NRSV,he replied your brother has come and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has got him back safe and sound
2490,LUK,15,NRSV,then he became angry and refused to go in
2491,LUK,15,NRSV,his father came out and began to plead with him
2492,LUK,15,NRSV,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends
2493,LUK,15,NRSV,but when this son of yours came back who has devoured your property with prostitutes you killed the fatted calf for him then the father said to him son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours
2494,LUK,15,NRSV,but we had to celebrate and rejoice because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life he was lost and has been found
2495,LUK,15,NRSV,
2496,LUK,16,NRSV,then jesus said to the disciples there was a rich man who had a manager and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property
2497,LUK,16,NRSV,so he summoned him and said to him what is this that i hear about you
2498,LUK,16,NRSV,give me an accounting of your management because you cannot be my manager any longer
2499,LUK,16,NRSV,then the manager said to himself what will i do now that my master is taking the position away from me
2500,LUK,16,NRSV,i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg
2501,LUK,16,NRSV,i have decided what to do so that when i am dismissed as manager people may welcome me into their homes
2502,LUK,16,NRSV,so summoning his masters debtors one by one he asked the first how much do you owe my master
2503,LUK,16,NRSV,he answered a hundred jugs of olive oil
2504,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him take your bill sit down quickly and make it fifty
2505,LUK,16,NRSV,then he asked another and how much do you owe
2506,LUK,16,NRSV,he replied a hundred containers of wheat
2507,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him take your bill and make it eighty
2508,LUK,16,NRSV,and his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light
2509,LUK,16,NRSV,and i tell you make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone they may welcome you into the eternal homes
2510,LUK,16,NRSV,whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much
2511,LUK,16,NRSV,if then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth who will entrust to you the true riches
2512,LUK,16,NRSV,and if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another who will give you what is your own
2513,LUK,16,NRSV,no slave can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other
2514,LUK,16,NRSV,you cannot serve god and wealth
2515,LUK,16,NRSV,the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all this and they ridiculed him
2516,LUK,16,NRSV,so he said to them you are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others but god knows your hearts for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of god
2517,LUK,16,NRSV,the law and the prophets were in effect until john came since then the good news of the kingdom of god is proclaimed and everyone tries to enter it by force
2518,LUK,16,NRSV,but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped
2519,LUK,16,NRSV,anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery
2520,LUK,16,NRSV,there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day
2521,LUK,16,NRSV,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores
2522,LUK,16,NRSV,the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with abraham
2523,LUK,16,NRSV,the rich man also died and was buried
2524,LUK,16,NRSV,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side
2525,LUK,16,NRSV,he called out father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in agony in these flames
2526,LUK,16,NRSV,but abraham said child remember that during your lifetime you received your good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony
2527,LUK,16,NRSV,besides all this between you and us a great chasm has been fixed so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so and no one can cross from there to us
2528,LUK,16,NRSV,he said then father i beg you to send him to my fathers house for i have five brothersthat he may warn them so that they will not also come into this place of torment
2529,LUK,16,NRSV,abraham replied they have moses and the prophets they should listen to them
2530,LUK,16,NRSV,he said no father abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent
2531,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead
2532,LUK,16,NRSV,
2533,LUK,17,NRSV,jesus said to his disciples occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to anyone by whom they come it would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble
2534,LUK,17,NRSV,be on your guard if another disciple sins you must rebuke the offender and if there is repentance you must forgive
2535,LUK,17,NRSV,and if the same person sins against you seven times a day and turns back to you seven times and says i repent you must forgive
2536,LUK,17,NRSV,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith the lord replied if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you
2537,LUK,17,NRSV,who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field come here at once and take your place at the table
2538,LUK,17,NRSV,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink
2539,LUK,17,NRSV,do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded
2540,LUK,17,NRSV,so you also when you have done all that you were ordered to do say we are worthless slaves we have done only what we ought to have done on the way to jerusalem jesus was going through the region between samaria and galilee
2541,LUK,17,NRSV,as he entered a village ten lepers approached him
2542,LUK,17,NRSV,keeping their distance they called out saying jesus master have mercy on us when he saw them he said to them go and show yourselves to the priests
2543,LUK,17,NRSV,and as they went they were made clean
2544,LUK,17,NRSV,then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising god with a loud voice
2545,LUK,17,NRSV,he prostrated himself at jesus feet and thanked him
2546,LUK,17,NRSV,and he was a samaritan
2547,LUK,17,NRSV,then jesus asked were not ten made clean
2548,LUK,17,NRSV,but the other nine where are they
2549,LUK,17,NRSV,was none of them found to return and give praise to god except this foreigner
2550,LUK,17,NRSV,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well
2551,LUK,17,NRSV,once jesus was asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god was coming and he answered the kingdom of god is not coming with things that can be observed nor will they say look here it is or there it is for in fact the kingdom of god is among you
2552,LUK,17,NRSV,then he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man and you will not see it
2553,LUK,17,NRSV,they will say to you look there or look here do not go do not set off in pursuit
2554,LUK,17,NRSV,for as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other so will the son of man be in his day
2555,LUK,17,NRSV,but first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation
2556,LUK,17,NRSV,just as it was in the days of noah so too it will be in the days of the son of man
2557,LUK,17,NRSV,they were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed all of them
2558,LUK,17,NRSV,likewise just as it was in the days of lot they were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building but on the day that lot left sodom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them it will be like that on the day that the son of man is revealed
2559,LUK,17,NRSV,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back
2560,LUK,17,NRSV,remember lots wife
2561,LUK,17,NRSV,those who try to make their life secure will lose it but those who lose their life will keep it
2562,LUK,17,NRSV,i tell you on that night there will be two in one bed one will be taken and the other left
2563,LUK,17,NRSV,there will be two women grinding meal together one will be taken and the other left
2564,LUK,17,NRSV,then they asked him where lord
2565,LUK,17,NRSV,he said to them where the corpse is there the vultures will gather
2566,LUK,18,NRSV,then jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart
2567,LUK,18,NRSV,he said in a certain city there was a judge who neither feared god nor had respect for people
2568,LUK,18,NRSV,in that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying grant me justice against my opponent
2569,LUK,18,NRSV,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming
2570,LUK,18,NRSV,and the lord said listen to what the unjust judge says
2571,LUK,18,NRSV,and will not god grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night
2572,LUK,18,NRSV,will he delay long in helping them
2573,LUK,18,NRSV,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them
2574,LUK,18,NRSV,and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth
2575,LUK,18,NRSV,he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector
2576,LUK,18,NRSV,the pharisee standing by himself was praying thus god i thank you that i am not like other people thieves rogues adulterers or even like this tax collector
2577,LUK,18,NRSV,i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income
2578,LUK,18,NRSV,but the tax collector standing far off would not even look up to heaven but was beating his breast and saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his home justified rather than the other for all who exalt themselves will be humbled but all who humble themselves will be exalted
2579,LUK,18,NRSV,people were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them and when the disciples saw it they sternly ordered them not to do it
2580,LUK,18,NRSV,but jesus called for them and said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs
2581,LUK,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it
2582,LUK,18,NRSV,a certain ruler asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
2583,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good
2584,LUK,18,NRSV,no one is good but god alone
2585,LUK,18,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother
2586,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied i have kept all these since my youth
2587,LUK,18,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to him there is still one thing lacking
2588,LUK,18,NRSV,sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
2589,LUK,18,NRSV,but when he heard this he became sad for he was very rich
2590,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
2591,LUK,18,NRSV,those who heard it said then who can be saved
2592,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied what is impossible for mortals is possible for god
2593,LUK,18,NRSV,then peter said look we have left our homes and followed you
2594,LUK,18,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god who will not get back very much more in this age and in the age to come eternal life
2595,LUK,18,NRSV,then he took the twelve aside and said to them see we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written about the son of man by the prophets will be accomplished
2596,LUK,18,NRSV,for he will be handed over to the gentiles and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon
2597,LUK,18,NRSV,after they have flogged him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again
2598,LUK,18,NRSV,but they understood nothing about all these things in fact what he said was hidden from them and they did not grasp what was said
2599,LUK,18,NRSV,as he approached jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging
2600,LUK,18,NRSV,when he heard a crowd going by he asked what was happening
2601,LUK,18,NRSV,they told him jesus of nazareth is passing by
2602,LUK,18,NRSV,then he shouted jesus son of david have mercy on me those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet but he shouted even more loudly son of david have mercy on me jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him and when he came near he asked him what do you want me to do for you
2603,LUK,18,NRSV,he said lord let me see again
2604,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has saved you
2605,LUK,18,NRSV,immediately he regained his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it praised god
2606,LUK,19,NRSV,he entered jericho and was passing through it
2607,LUK,19,NRSV,a man was there named zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was rich
2608,LUK,19,NRSV,he was trying to see who jesus was but on account of the crowd he could not because he was short in stature
2609,LUK,19,NRSV,so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him because he was going to pass that way
2610,LUK,19,NRSV,when jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him zacchaeus hurry and come down for i must stay at your house today
2611,LUK,19,NRSV,so he hurried down and was happy to welcome him
2612,LUK,19,NRSV,all who saw it began to grumble and said he has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner
2613,LUK,19,NRSV,zacchaeus stood there and said to the lord look half of my possessions lord i will give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i will pay back four times as much
2614,LUK,19,NRSV,then jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham
2615,LUK,19,NRSV,for the son of man came to seek out and to save the lost
2616,LUK,19,NRSV,as they were listening to this he went on to tell a parable because he was near jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of god was to appear immediately
2617,LUK,19,NRSV,so he said a nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return
2618,LUK,19,NRSV,he summoned ten of his slaves and gave them ten pounds and said to them do business with these until i come back
2619,LUK,19,NRSV,but the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him saying we do not want this man to rule over us
2620,LUK,19,NRSV,when he returned having received royal power he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading
2621,LUK,19,NRSV,the first came forward and said lord your pound has made ten more pounds
2622,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him well done good slave because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing take charge of ten cities
2623,LUK,19,NRSV,then the second came saying lord your pound has made five pounds
2624,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him and you rule over five cities
2625,LUK,19,NRSV,then the other came saying lord here is your pound
2626,LUK,19,NRSV,i wrapped it up in a piece of cloth for i was afraid of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow
2627,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him i will judge you by your own words you wicked slave you knew did you that i was a harsh man taking what i did not deposit and reaping what i did not sow
2628,LUK,19,NRSV,why then did you not put my money into the bank
2629,LUK,19,NRSV,then when i returned i could have collected it with interest
2630,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds
2631,LUK,19,NRSV,and they said to him lord he has ten pounds i tell you to all those who have more will be given but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
2632,LUK,19,NRSV,but as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here and slaughter them in my presence
2633,LUK,19,NRSV,after he had said this he went on ahead going up to jerusalem
2634,LUK,19,NRSV,when he had come near bethphage and bethany at the place called the mount of olives he sent two of the disciples saying go into the village ahead of you and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden
2635,LUK,19,NRSV,untie it and bring it here
2636,LUK,19,NRSV,if anyone asks you why are you untying it
2637,LUK,19,NRSV,just say this the lord needs it
2638,LUK,19,NRSV,so those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them
2639,LUK,19,NRSV,as they were untying the colt its owners asked them why are you untying the colt
2640,LUK,19,NRSV,they said the lord needs it
2641,LUK,19,NRSV,then they brought it to jesus and after throwing their cloaks on the colt they set jesus on it
2642,LUK,19,NRSV,as he rode along people kept spreading their cloaks on the road
2643,LUK,19,NRSV,as he was now approaching the path down from the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise god joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen saying blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven some of the pharisees in the crowd said to him teacher order your disciples to stop
2644,LUK,19,NRSV,he answered i tell you if these were silent the stones would shout out
2645,LUK,19,NRSV,as he came near and saw the city he wept over it saying if you even you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace but now they are hidden from your eyes
2646,LUK,19,NRSV,indeed the days will come upon you when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you and hem you in on every side
2647,LUK,19,NRSV,they will crush you to the ground you and your children within you and they will not leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from god
2648,LUK,19,NRSV,then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there and he said it is written my house shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers
2649,LUK,19,NRSV,every day he was teaching in the temple
2650,LUK,19,NRSV,the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were spellbound by what they heard
2651,LUK,20,NRSV,one day as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders and said to him tell us by what authority are you doing these things
2652,LUK,20,NRSV,who is it who gave you this authority
2653,LUK,20,NRSV,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin
2654,LUK,20,NRSV,they discussed it with one another saying if we say from heaven he will say why did you not believe him
2655,LUK,20,NRSV,but if we say of human origin all the people will stone us for they are convinced that john was a prophet
2656,LUK,20,NRSV,so they answered that they did not know where it came from
2657,LUK,20,NRSV,then jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things
2658,LUK,20,NRSV,he began to tell the people this parable a man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants and went to another country for a long time
2659,LUK,20,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard but the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded
2660,LUK,20,NRSV,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded
2661,LUK,20,NRSV,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out
2662,LUK,20,NRSV,then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do
2663,LUK,20,NRSV,i will send my beloved son perhaps they will respect him
2664,LUK,20,NRSV,but when the tenants saw him they discussed it among themselves and said this is the heir let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours
2665,LUK,20,NRSV,so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
2666,LUK,20,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them
2667,LUK,20,NRSV,he will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others
2668,LUK,20,NRSV,when they heard this they said heaven forbid but he looked at them and said what then does this text mean the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone
2669,LUK,20,NRSV,everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces and it will crush anyone on whom it falls
2670,LUK,20,NRSV,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people
2671,LUK,20,NRSV,so they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest in order to trap him by what he said so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor
2672,LUK,20,NRSV,so they asked him teacher we know that you are right in what you say and teach and you show deference to no one but teach the way of god in accordance with truth
2673,LUK,20,NRSV,is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not
2674,LUK,20,NRSV,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them show me a denarius
2675,LUK,20,NRSV,whose head and whose title does it bear
2676,LUK,20,NRSV,they said the emperors
2677,LUK,20,NRSV,he said to them then give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods
2678,LUK,20,NRSV,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent
2679,LUK,20,NRSV,some sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no children the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
2680,LUK,20,NRSV,now there were seven brothers the first married and died childless then the second and the third married her and so in the same way all seven died childless
2681,LUK,20,NRSV,finally the woman also died
2682,LUK,20,NRSV,in the resurrection therefore whose wife will the woman be
2683,LUK,20,NRSV,for the seven had married her
2684,LUK,20,NRSV,jesus said to them those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
2685,LUK,20,NRSV,indeed they cannot die anymore because they are like angels and are children of god being children of the resurrection
2686,LUK,20,NRSV,and the fact that the dead are raised moses himself showed in the story about the bush where he speaks of the lord as the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
2687,LUK,20,NRSV,now he is god not of the dead but of the living for to him all of them are alive
2688,LUK,20,NRSV,then some of the scribes answered teacher you have spoken well
2689,LUK,20,NRSV,for they no longer dared to ask him another question
2690,LUK,20,NRSV,then he said to them how can they say that the messiah is davids son
2691,LUK,20,NRSV,for david himself says in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool
2692,LUK,20,NRSV,david thus calls him lord so how can he be his son
2693,LUK,20,NRSV,in the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets
2694,LUK,20,NRSV,they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers
2695,LUK,20,NRSV,they will receive the greater condemnation
2696,LUK,21,NRSV,he looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the treasury he also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins
2697,LUK,21,NRSV,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on
2698,LUK,21,NRSV,when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to god he said as for these things that you see the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another all will be thrown down
2699,LUK,21,NRSV,they asked him teacher when will this be and what will be the sign that this is about to take place
2700,LUK,21,NRSV,and he said beware that you are not led astray for many will come in my name and say i am he and the time is near do not go after them
2701,LUK,21,NRSV,when you hear of wars and insurrections do not be terrified for these things must take place first but the end will not follow immediately
2702,LUK,21,NRSV,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven
2703,LUK,21,NRSV,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name
2704,LUK,21,NRSV,this will give you an opportunity to testify
2705,LUK,21,NRSV,so make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance for i will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict
2706,LUK,21,NRSV,you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers by relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death
2707,LUK,21,NRSV,you will be hated by all because of my name
2708,LUK,21,NRSV,but not a hair of your head will perish
2709,LUK,21,NRSV,by your endurance you will gain your souls
2710,LUK,21,NRSV,when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near
2711,LUK,21,NRSV,then those in judea must flee to the mountains and those inside the city must leave it and those out in the country must not enter it for these are days of vengeance as a fulfillment of all that is written
2712,LUK,21,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days for there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations and jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled
2713,LUK,21,NRSV,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves
2714,LUK,21,NRSV,people will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world for the powers of the heavens will be shaken
2715,LUK,21,NRSV,then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
2716,LUK,21,NRSV,now when these things begin to take place stand up and raise your heads because your redemption is drawing near
2717,LUK,21,NRSV,then he told them a parable look at the fig tree and all the trees as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near
2718,LUK,21,NRSV,so also when you see these things taking place you know that the kingdom of god is near
2719,LUK,21,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place
2720,LUK,21,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
2721,LUK,21,NRSV,be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life and that day catch you unexpectedly like a trap
2722,LUK,21,NRSV,for it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth
2723,LUK,21,NRSV,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man
2724,LUK,21,NRSV,every day he was teaching in the temple and at night he would go out and spend the night on the mount of olives as it was called
2725,LUK,21,NRSV,and all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple
2726,LUK,22,NRSV,now the festival of unleavened bread which is called the passover was near
2727,LUK,22,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put jesus to death for they were afraid of the people
2728,LUK,22,NRSV,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them
2729,LUK,22,NRSV,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money
2730,LUK,22,NRSV,so he consented and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present
2731,LUK,22,NRSV,then came the day of unleavened bread on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed
2732,LUK,22,NRSV,so jesus sent peter and john saying go and prepare the passover meal for us that we may eat it
2733,LUK,22,NRSV,they asked him where do you want us to make preparations for it
2734,LUK,22,NRSV,listen he said to them when you have entered the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him into the house he enters and say to the owner of the house the teacher asks you where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
2735,LUK,22,NRSV,he will show you a large room upstairs already furnished
2736,LUK,22,NRSV,make preparations for us there
2737,LUK,22,NRSV,so they went and found everything as he had told them and they prepared the passover meal
2738,LUK,22,NRSV,when the hour came he took his place at the table and the apostles with him
2739,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i tell you i will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god
2740,LUK,22,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he said take this and divide it among yourselves for i tell you that from now on i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes
2741,LUK,22,NRSV,then he took a loaf of bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body which is given for you
2742,LUK,22,NRSV,do this in remembrance of me
2743,LUK,22,NRSV,and he did the same with the cup after supper saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood
2744,LUK,22,NRSV,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table
2745,LUK,22,NRSV,for the son of man is going as it has been determined but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this
2746,LUK,22,NRSV,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest
2747,LUK,22,NRSV,but he said to them the kings of the gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors
2748,LUK,22,NRSV,but not so with you rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest and the leader like one who serves
2749,LUK,22,NRSV,for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves
2750,LUK,22,NRSV,is it not the one at the table
2751,LUK,22,NRSV,but i am among you as one who serves
2752,LUK,22,NRSV,you are those who have stood by me in my trials and i confer on you just as my father has conferred on me a kingdom so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
2753,LUK,22,NRSV,simon simon listen satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat but i have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail and you when once you have turned back strengthen your brothers
2754,LUK,22,NRSV,and he said to him lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death jesus said i tell you peter the cock will not crow this day until you have denied three times that you know me
2755,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them when i sent you out without a purse bag or sandals did you lack anything
2756,LUK,22,NRSV,they said no not a thing
2757,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them but now the one who has a purse must take it and likewise a bag
2758,LUK,22,NRSV,and the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one
2759,LUK,22,NRSV,for i tell you this scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was counted among the lawless and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled
2760,LUK,22,NRSV,they said lord look here are two swords
2761,LUK,22,NRSV,he replied it is enough
2762,LUK,22,NRSV,he came out and went as was his custom to the mount of olives and the disciples followed him
2763,LUK,22,NRSV,when he reached the place he said to them pray that you may not come into the time of trial
2764,LUK,22,NRSV,then he withdrew from them about a stones throw knelt down and prayed father if you are willing remove this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done
2765,LUK,22,NRSV, then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength
2766,LUK,22,NRSV,in his anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground when he got up from prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief and he said to them why are you sleeping
2767,LUK,22,NRSV,get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial
2768,LUK,22,NRSV,while he was still speaking suddenly a crowd came and the one called judas one of the twelve was leading them
2769,LUK,22,NRSV,he approached jesus to kiss him but jesus said to him judas is it with a kiss that you are betraying the son of man
2770,LUK,22,NRSV,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword
2771,LUK,22,NRSV,then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear
2772,LUK,22,NRSV,but jesus said no more of this and he touched his ear and healed him
2773,LUK,22,NRSV,then jesus said to the chief priests the officers of the temple police and the elders who had come for him have you come out with swords and clubs as if i were a bandit
2774,LUK,22,NRSV,when i was with you day after day in the temple you did not lay hands on me
2775,LUK,22,NRSV,but this is your hour and the power of darkness then they seized him and led him away bringing him into the high priests house
2776,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter was following at a distance
2777,LUK,22,NRSV,when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together peter sat among them
2778,LUK,22,NRSV,then a servantgirl seeing him in the firelight stared at him and said this man also was with him
2779,LUK,22,NRSV,but he denied it saying woman i do not know him
2780,LUK,22,NRSV,a little later someone else on seeing him said you also are one of them
2781,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter said man i am not then about an hour later still another kept insisting surely this man also was with him for he is a galilean
2782,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter said man i do not know what you are talking about at that moment while he was still speaking the cock crowed
2783,LUK,22,NRSV,the lord turned and looked at peter
2784,LUK,22,NRSV,then peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said to him before the cock crows today you will deny me three times
2785,LUK,22,NRSV,and he went out and wept bitterly
2786,LUK,22,NRSV,now the men who were holding jesus began to mock him and beat him they also blindfolded him and kept asking him prophesy who is it that struck you
2787,LUK,22,NRSV,they kept heaping many other insults on him
2788,LUK,22,NRSV,when day came the assembly of the elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they brought him to their council
2789,LUK,22,NRSV,they said if you are the messiah tell us
2790,LUK,22,NRSV,he replied if i tell you you will not believe and if i question you you will not answer
2791,LUK,22,NRSV,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god
2792,LUK,22,NRSV,all of them asked are you then the son of god
2793,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them you say that i am
2794,LUK,22,NRSV,then they said what further testimony do we need
2795,LUK,22,NRSV,we have heard it ourselves from his own lips
2796,LUK,23,NRSV,then the assembly rose as a body and brought jesus before pilate
2797,LUK,23,NRSV,they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor and saying that he himself is the messiah a king
2798,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate asked him are you the king of the jews
2799,LUK,23,NRSV,he answered you say so
2800,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds i find no basis for an accusation against this man
2801,LUK,23,NRSV,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place
2802,LUK,23,NRSV,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean
2803,LUK,23,NRSV,and when he learned that he was under herods jurisdiction he sent him off to herod who was himself in jerusalem at that time
2804,LUK,23,NRSV,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign
2805,LUK,23,NRSV,he questioned him at some length but jesus gave him no answer
2806,LUK,23,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him
2807,LUK,23,NRSV,even herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him then he put an elegant robe on him and sent him back to pilate
2808,LUK,23,NRSV,that same day herod and pilate became friends with each other before this they had been enemies
2809,LUK,23,NRSV,pilate then called together the chief priests the leaders and the people and said to them you brought me this man as one who was perverting the people and here i have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him
2810,LUK,23,NRSV,neither has herod for he sent him back to us
2811,LUK,23,NRSV,indeed he has done nothing to deserve death
2812,LUK,23,NRSV,i will therefore have him flogged and release him
2813,LUK,23,NRSV,then they all shouted out together away with this fellow release barabbas for us this was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city and for murder pilate wanting to release jesus addressed them again but they kept shouting crucify crucify him a third time he said to them why what evil has he done
2814,LUK,23,NRSV,i have found in him no ground for the sentence of death i will therefore have him flogged and then release him
2815,LUK,23,NRSV,but they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified and their voices prevailed
2816,LUK,23,NRSV,so pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted
2817,LUK,23,NRSV,he released the man they asked for the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder and he handed jesus over as they wished
2818,LUK,23,NRSV,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus
2819,LUK,23,NRSV,a great number of the people followed him and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him
2820,LUK,23,NRSV,but jesus turned to them and said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
2821,LUK,23,NRSV,for the days are surely coming when they will say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed
2822,LUK,23,NRSV,then they will begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us
2823,LUK,23,NRSV,for if they do this when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry
2824,LUK,23,NRSV,two others also who were criminals were led away to be put to death with him
2825,LUK,23,NRSV,when they came to the place that is called the skull they crucified jesus there with the criminals one on his right and one on his left
2826,LUK,23,NRSV, then jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they cast lots to divide his clothing
2827,LUK,23,NRSV,and the people stood by watching but the leaders scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the messiah of god his chosen one the soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself there was also an inscription over him this is the king of the jews
2828,LUK,23,NRSV,one of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying are you not the messiah
2829,LUK,23,NRSV,save yourself and us but the other rebuked him saying do you not fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation
2830,LUK,23,NRSV,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
2831,LUK,23,NRSV,then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom
2832,LUK,23,NRSV,he replied truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise
2833,LUK,23,NRSV,it was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon while the suns light failed and the curtain of the temple was torn in two
2834,LUK,23,NRSV,then jesus crying with a loud voice said father into your hands i commend my spirit
2835,LUK,23,NRSV,having said this he breathed his last
2836,LUK,23,NRSV,when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised god and said certainly this man was innocent
2837,LUK,23,NRSV,and when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place they returned home beating their breasts
2838,LUK,23,NRSV,but all his acquaintances including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things
2839,LUK,23,NRSV,now there was a good and righteous man named joseph who though a member of the council had not agreed to their plan and action
2840,LUK,23,NRSV,he came from the jewish town of arimathea and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god
2841,LUK,23,NRSV,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus
2842,LUK,23,NRSV,then he took it down wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a rockhewn tomb where no one had ever been laid
2843,LUK,23,NRSV,it was the day of preparation and the sabbath was beginning
2844,LUK,23,NRSV,the women who had come with him from galilee followed and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid
2845,LUK,23,NRSV,then they returned and prepared spices and ointments
2846,LUK,23,NRSV,on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment
2847,LUK,24,NRSV,but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb taking the spices that they had prepared
2848,LUK,24,NRSV,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they went in they did not find the body
2849,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were perplexed about this suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them
2850,LUK,24,NRSV,the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead
2851,LUK,24,NRSV,he is not here but has risen
2852,LUK,24,NRSV,remember how he told you while he was still in galilee that the son of man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified and on the third day rise again
2853,LUK,24,NRSV,then they remembered his words and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest
2854,LUK,24,NRSV,now it was mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the other women with them who told this to the apostles
2855,LUK,24,NRSV,but these words seemed to them an idle tale and they did not believe them
2856,LUK,24,NRSV,but peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves then he went home amazed at what had happened
2857,LUK,24,NRSV,now on that same day two of them were going to a village called emmaus about seven miles from jerusalem and talking with each other about all these things that had happened
2858,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him
2859,LUK,24,NRSV,and he said to them what are you discussing with each other while you walk along
2860,LUK,24,NRSV,they stood still looking sad
2861,LUK,24,NRSV,then one of them whose name was cleopas answered him are you the only stranger in jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days
2862,LUK,24,NRSV,he asked them what things
2863,LUK,24,NRSV,they replied the things about jesus of nazareth who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him
2864,LUK,24,NRSV,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel
2865,LUK,24,NRSV,yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things took place
2866,LUK,24,NRSV,moreover some women of our group astounded us
2867,LUK,24,NRSV,they were at the tomb early this morning and when they did not find his body there they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive
2868,LUK,24,NRSV,some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him
2869,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them oh how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared was it not necessary that the messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory
2870,LUK,24,NRSV,then beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures
2871,LUK,24,NRSV,as they came near the village to which they were going he walked ahead as if he were going on
2872,LUK,24,NRSV,but they urged him strongly saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over
2873,LUK,24,NRSV,so he went in to stay with them
2874,LUK,24,NRSV,when he was at the table with them he took bread blessed and broke it and gave it to them
2875,LUK,24,NRSV,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight
2876,LUK,24,NRSV,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us
2877,LUK,24,NRSV,that same hour they got up and returned to jerusalem and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together
2878,LUK,24,NRSV,they were saying the lord has risen indeed and he has appeared to simon then they told what had happened on the road and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread
2879,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you
2880,LUK,24,NRSV,they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost
2881,LUK,24,NRSV,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts
2882,LUK,24,NRSV,look at my hands and my feet see that it is i myself
2883,LUK,24,NRSV,touch me and see for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have
2884,LUK,24,NRSV,and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet
2885,LUK,24,NRSV,while in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering he said to them have you anything here to eat
2886,LUK,24,NRSV,they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate in their presence
2887,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with youthat everything written about me in the law of moses the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled
2888,LUK,24,NRSV,then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures and he said to them thus it is written that the messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations beginning from jerusalem
2889,LUK,24,NRSV,you are witnesses of these things
2890,LUK,24,NRSV,and see i am sending upon you what my father promised so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high
2891,LUK,24,NRSV,then he led them out as far as bethany and lifting up his hands he blessed them
2892,LUK,24,NRSV,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven
2893,LUK,24,NRSV,and they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and they were continually in the temple blessing god
2894,JHN,1,NRSV,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
2895,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the beginning with god
2896,JHN,1,NRSV,all things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being
2897,JHN,1,NRSV,what has come into being in him was life and the life was the light of all people
2898,JHN,1,NRSV,the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it
2899,JHN,1,NRSV,there was a man sent from god whose name was john
2900,JHN,1,NRSV,he came as a witness to testify to the light so that all might believe through him
2901,JHN,1,NRSV,he himself was not the light but he came to testify to the light
2902,JHN,1,NRSV,the true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world
2903,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the world and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know him
2904,JHN,1,NRSV,he came to what was his own and his own people did not accept him
2905,JHN,1,NRSV,but to all who received him who believed in his name he gave power to become children of god who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god
2906,JHN,1,NRSV,and the word became flesh and lived among us and we have seen his glory the glory as of a fathers only son full of grace and truth
2907,JHN,1,NRSV,john testified to him and cried out this was he of whom i said he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me
2908,JHN,1,NRSV, from his fullness we have all received grace upon grace
2909,JHN,1,NRSV,the law indeed was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ
2910,JHN,1,NRSV,no one has ever seen god
2911,JHN,1,NRSV,it is god the only son who is close to the fathers heart who has made him known
2912,JHN,1,NRSV,this is the testimony given by john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who are you
2913,JHN,1,NRSV,he confessed and did not deny it but confessed i am not the messiah
2914,JHN,1,NRSV,and they asked him what then
2915,JHN,1,NRSV,are you elijah
2916,JHN,1,NRSV,he said i am not
2917,JHN,1,NRSV,are you the prophet
2918,JHN,1,NRSV,he answered no then they said to him who are you
2919,JHN,1,NRSV,let us have an answer for those who sent us
2920,JHN,1,NRSV,what do you say about yourself
2921,JHN,1,NRSV,he said i am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as the prophet isaiah said
2922,JHN,1,NRSV,now they had been sent from the pharisees
2923,JHN,1,NRSV,they asked him why then are you baptizing if you are neither the messiah nor elijah nor the prophet
2924,JHN,1,NRSV,john answered them i baptize with water
2925,JHN,1,NRSV,among you stands one whom you do not know the one who is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal
2926,JHN,1,NRSV,this took place in bethany across the jordan where john was baptizing
2927,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and declared here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me
2928,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but i came baptizing with water for this reason that he might be revealed to israel
2929,JHN,1,NRSV,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him
2930,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you see the spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the holy spirit
2931,JHN,1,NRSV,and i myself have seen and have testified that this is the son of god
2932,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus
2933,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for
2934,JHN,1,NRSV,they said to him rabbi which translated means teacher where are you staying
2935,JHN,1,NRSV,he said to them come and see
2936,JHN,1,NRSV,they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day
2937,JHN,1,NRSV,it was about four oclock in the afternoon
2938,JHN,1,NRSV,one of the two who heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother
2939,JHN,1,NRSV,he first found his brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated anointed 
2940,JHN,1,NRSV,he brought simon to jesus who looked at him and said you are simon son of john
2941,JHN,1,NRSV,you are to be called cephas which is translated peter 
2942,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day jesus decided to go to galilee
2943,JHN,1,NRSV,he found philip and said to him follow me
2944,JHN,1,NRSV,now philip was from bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
2945,JHN,1,NRSV,philip found nathanael and said to him we have found him about whom moses in the law and also the prophets wrote jesus son of joseph from nazareth
2946,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael said to him can anything good come out of nazareth
2947,JHN,1,NRSV,philip said to him come and see
2948,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus saw nathanael coming toward him he said of him here is truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit nathanael asked him where did you get to know me
2949,JHN,1,NRSV,jesus answered i saw you under the fig tree before philip called you
2950,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel jesus answered do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree
2951,JHN,1,NRSV,you will see greater things than these
2952,JHN,1,NRSV,and he said to him very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
2953,JHN,2,NRSV,on the third day there was a wedding in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there
2954,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding
2955,JHN,2,NRSV,when the wine gave out the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine
2956,JHN,2,NRSV,and jesus said to her woman what concern is that to you and to me
2957,JHN,2,NRSV,my hour has not yet come
2958,JHN,2,NRSV,his mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you
2959,JHN,2,NRSV,now standing there were six stone water jars for the jewish rites of purification each holding twenty or thirty gallons
2960,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus said to them fill the jars with water
2961,JHN,2,NRSV,and they filled them up to the brim
2962,JHN,2,NRSV,he said to them now draw some out and take it to the chief steward
2963,JHN,2,NRSV,so they took it
2964,JHN,2,NRSV,when the steward tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it came from though the servants who had drawn the water knew the steward called the bridegroom and said to him everyone serves the good wine first and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk
2965,JHN,2,NRSV,but you have kept the good wine until now
2966,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him
2967,JHN,2,NRSV,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days
2968,JHN,2,NRSV,the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem
2969,JHN,2,NRSV,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables
2970,JHN,2,NRSV,making a whip of cords he drove all of them out of the temple both the sheep and the cattle
2971,JHN,2,NRSV,he also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables
2972,JHN,2,NRSV,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me
2973,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this
2974,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus answered them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
2975,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said this temple has been under construction for fortysix years and will you raise it up in three days
2976,JHN,2,NRSV,but he was speaking of the temple of his body
2977,JHN,2,NRSV,after he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word that jesus had spoken
2978,JHN,2,NRSV,when he was in jerusalem during the passover festival many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing
2979,JHN,2,NRSV,but jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to testify about anyone for he himself knew what was in everyone
2980,JHN,3,NRSV,now there was a pharisee named nicodemus a leader of the jews
2981,JHN,3,NRSV,he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god
2982,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above
2983,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can anyone be born after having grown old
2984,JHN,3,NRSV,can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born
2985,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit
2986,JHN,3,NRSV,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit
2987,JHN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished that i said to you you must be born from above
2988,JHN,3,NRSV,the wind blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes
2989,JHN,3,NRSV,so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit
2990,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can these things be
2991,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things
2992,JHN,3,NRSV,very truly i tell you we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen yet you do not receive our testimony
2993,JHN,3,NRSV,if i have told you about earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if i tell you about heavenly things
2994,JHN,3,NRSV,no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven the son of man
2995,JHN,3,NRSV,and just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life
2996,JHN,3,NRSV,for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life
2997,JHN,3,NRSV,indeed god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him
2998,JHN,3,NRSV,those who believe in him are not condemned but those who do not believe are condemned already because they have not believed in the name of the only son of god
2999,JHN,3,NRSV,and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil
3000,JHN,3,NRSV,for all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light so that their deeds may not be exposed
3001,JHN,3,NRSV,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god
3002,JHN,3,NRSV,after this jesus and his disciples went into the judean countryside and he spent some time there with them and baptized
3003,JHN,3,NRSV,john also was baptizing at aenon near salim because water was abundant there and people kept coming and were being baptized john of course had not yet been thrown into prison
3004,JHN,3,NRSV,now a discussion about purification arose between johns disciples and a jew
3005,JHN,3,NRSV,they came to john and said to him rabbi the one who was with you across the jordan to whom you testified here he is baptizing and all are going to him
3006,JHN,3,NRSV,john answered no one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven
3007,JHN,3,NRSV,you yourselves are my witnesses that i said i am not the messiah but i have been sent ahead of him
3008,JHN,3,NRSV,he who has the bride is the bridegroom
3009,JHN,3,NRSV,the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegrooms voice
3010,JHN,3,NRSV,for this reason my joy has been fulfilled
3011,JHN,3,NRSV,he must increase but i must decrease
3012,JHN,3,NRSV,the one who comes from above is above all the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things
3013,JHN,3,NRSV,the one who comes from heaven is above all
3014,JHN,3,NRSV,he testifies to what he has seen and heard yet no one accepts his testimony
3015,JHN,3,NRSV,whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this that god is true
3016,JHN,3,NRSV,he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he gives the spirit without measure
3017,JHN,3,NRSV,the father loves the son and has placed all things in his hands
3018,JHN,3,NRSV,whoever believes in the son has eternal life whoever disobeys the son will not see life but must endure gods wrath
3019,JHN,4,NRSV,now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized he left judea and started back to galilee
3020,JHN,4,NRSV,but he had to go through samaria
3021,JHN,4,NRSV,so he came to a samaritan city called sychar near the plot of ground that jacob had given to his son joseph
3022,JHN,4,NRSV,jacobs well was there and jesus tired out by his journey was sitting by the well
3023,JHN,4,NRSV,it was about noon
3024,JHN,4,NRSV,a samaritan woman came to draw water and jesus said to her give me a drink
3025,JHN,4,NRSV,his disciples had gone to the city to buy food the samaritan woman said to him how is it that you a jew ask a drink of me a woman of samaria
3026,JHN,4,NRSV,jews do not share things in common with samaritans jesus answered her if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
3027,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir you have no bucket and the well is deep
3028,JHN,4,NRSV,where do you get that living water
3029,JHN,4,NRSV,are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it
3030,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty
3031,JHN,4,NRSV,the water that i will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life
3032,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water
3033,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her go call your husband and come back
3034,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman answered him i have no husband
3035,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband
3036,JHN,4,NRSV,what you have said is true the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet
3037,JHN,4,NRSV,our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem
3038,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem
3039,JHN,4,NRSV,you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews
3040,JHN,4,NRSV,but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him
3041,JHN,4,NRSV,god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
3042,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him i know that messiah is coming who is called christ
3043,JHN,4,NRSV,when he comes he will proclaim all things to us
3044,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her i am he the one who is speaking to you
3045,JHN,4,NRSV,just then his disciples came
3046,JHN,4,NRSV,they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman but no one said what do you want
3047,JHN,4,NRSV,or why are you speaking with her
3048,JHN,4,NRSV,then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city
3049,JHN,4,NRSV,she said to the people come and see a man who told me everything i have ever done he cannot be the messiah can he
3050,JHN,4,NRSV,they left the city and were on their way to him
3051,JHN,4,NRSV,meanwhile the disciples were urging him rabbi eat something
3052,JHN,4,NRSV,but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about
3053,JHN,4,NRSV,so the disciples said to one another surely no one has brought him something to eat
3054,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work
3055,JHN,4,NRSV,do you not say four months more then comes the harvest
3056,JHN,4,NRSV,but i tell you look around you and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting
3057,JHN,4,NRSV,the reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together
3058,JHN,4,NRSV,for here the saying holds true one sows and another reaps
3059,JHN,4,NRSV,i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor
3060,JHN,4,NRSV,others have labored and you have entered into their labor
3061,JHN,4,NRSV,many samaritans from that city believed in him because of the womans testimony he told me everything i have ever done
3062,JHN,4,NRSV,so when the samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days
3063,JHN,4,NRSV,and many more believed because of his word
3064,JHN,4,NRSV,they said to the woman it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this is truly the savior of the world
3065,JHN,4,NRSV,when the two days were over he went from that place to galilee for jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophets own country
3066,JHN,4,NRSV,when he came to galilee the galileans welcomed him since they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival
3067,JHN,4,NRSV,then he came again to cana in galilee where he had changed the water into wine
3068,JHN,4,NRSV,now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in capernaum
3069,JHN,4,NRSV,when he heard that jesus had come from judea to galilee he went and begged him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death
3070,JHN,4,NRSV,then jesus said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe
3071,JHN,4,NRSV,the official said to him sir come down before my little boy dies
3072,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to him go your son will live
3073,JHN,4,NRSV,the man believed the word that jesus spoke to him and started on his way
3074,JHN,4,NRSV,as he was going down his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive
3075,JHN,4,NRSV,so he asked them the hour when he began to recover and they said to him yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him
3076,JHN,4,NRSV,the father realized that this was the hour when jesus had said to him your son will live
3077,JHN,4,NRSV,so he himself believed along with his whole household
3078,JHN,4,NRSV,now this was the second sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee
3079,JHN,5,NRSV,after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
3080,JHN,5,NRSV,now in jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool called in hebrew bethzatha which has five porticoes
3081,JHN,5,NRSV,in these lay many invalidsblind lame and paralyzed
3082,JHN,5,NRSV,one man was there who had been ill for thirtyeight years
3083,JHN,5,NRSV,when jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be made well
3084,JHN,5,NRSV,the sick man answered him sir i have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up and while i am making my way someone else steps down ahead of me
3085,JHN,5,NRSV,jesus said to him stand up take your mat and walk
3086,JHN,5,NRSV,at once the man was made well and he took up his mat and began to walk
3087,JHN,5,NRSV,now that day was a sabbath
3088,JHN,5,NRSV,so the jews said to the man who had been cured it is the sabbath it is not lawful for you to carry your mat
3089,JHN,5,NRSV,but he answered them the man who made me well said to me take up your mat and walk
3090,JHN,5,NRSV,they asked him who is the man who said to you take it up and walk
3091,JHN,5,NRSV,now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there
3092,JHN,5,NRSV,later jesus found him in the temple and said to him see you have been made well do not sin any more so that nothing worse happens to you
3093,JHN,5,NRSV,the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well
3094,JHN,5,NRSV,therefore the jews started persecuting jesus because he was doing such things on the sabbath
3095,JHN,5,NRSV,but jesus answered them my father is still working and i also am working
3096,JHN,5,NRSV,for this reason the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he was not only breaking the sabbath but was also calling god his own father thereby making himself equal to god
3097,JHN,5,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you the son can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father does the son does likewise
3098,JHN,5,NRSV,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished
3099,JHN,5,NRSV,indeed just as the father raises the dead and gives them life so also the son gives life to whomever he wishes
3100,JHN,5,NRSV,the father judges no one but has given all judgment to the son so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father
3101,JHN,5,NRSV,anyone who does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him
3102,JHN,5,NRSV,very truly i tell you anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment but has passed from death to life
3103,JHN,5,NRSV,very truly i tell you the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live
3104,JHN,5,NRSV,for just as the father has life in himself so he has granted the son also to have life in himself and he has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the son of man
3105,JHN,5,NRSV,do not be astonished at this for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and will come outthose who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation
3106,JHN,5,NRSV,i can do nothing on my own
3107,JHN,5,NRSV,as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me
3108,JHN,5,NRSV,if i testify about myself my testimony is not true
3109,JHN,5,NRSV,there is another who testifies on my behalf and i know that his testimony to me is true
3110,JHN,5,NRSV,you sent messengers to john and he testified to the truth
3111,JHN,5,NRSV,not that i accept such human testimony but i say these things so that you may be saved
3112,JHN,5,NRSV,he was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light
3113,JHN,5,NRSV,but i have a testimony greater than johns
3114,JHN,5,NRSV,the works that the father has given me to complete the very works that i am doing testify on my behalf that the father has sent me
3115,JHN,5,NRSV,and the father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf
3116,JHN,5,NRSV,you have never heard his voice or seen his form and you do not have his word abiding in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent
3117,JHN,5,NRSV,you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is they that testify on my behalf
3118,JHN,5,NRSV,yet you refuse to come to me to have life
3119,JHN,5,NRSV,i do not accept glory from human beings
3120,JHN,5,NRSV,but i know that you do not have the love of god in you
3121,JHN,5,NRSV,i have come in my fathers name and you do not accept me if another comes in his own name you will accept him
3122,JHN,5,NRSV,how can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is god
3123,JHN,5,NRSV,do not think that i will accuse you before the father your accuser is moses on whom you have set your hope
3124,JHN,5,NRSV,if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me
3125,JHN,5,NRSV,but if you do not believe what he wrote how will you believe what i say
3126,JHN,6,NRSV,after this jesus went to the other side of the sea of galilee also called the sea of tiberias
3127,JHN,6,NRSV,a large crowd kept following him because they saw the signs that he was doing for the sick
3128,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus went up the mountain and sat down there with his disciples
3129,JHN,6,NRSV,now the passover the festival of the jews was near
3130,JHN,6,NRSV,when he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him jesus said to philip where are we to buy bread for these people to eat
3131,JHN,6,NRSV,he said this to test him for he himself knew what he was going to do
3132,JHN,6,NRSV,philip answered him six months wages would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little
3133,JHN,6,NRSV,one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother said to him there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish
3134,JHN,6,NRSV,but what are they among so many people
3135,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus said make the people sit down
3136,JHN,6,NRSV,now there was a great deal of grass in the place so they sat down about five thousand in all
3137,JHN,6,NRSV,then jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so also the fish as much as they wanted
3138,JHN,6,NRSV,when they were satisfied he told his disciples gather up the fragments left over so that nothing may be lost
3139,JHN,6,NRSV,so they gathered them up and from the fragments of the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten they filled twelve baskets
3140,JHN,6,NRSV,when the people saw the sign that he had done they began to say this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world
3141,JHN,6,NRSV,when jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king he withdrew again to the mountain by himself
3142,JHN,6,NRSV,when evening came his disciples went down to the sea got into a boat and started across the sea to capernaum
3143,JHN,6,NRSV,it was now dark and jesus had not yet come to them
3144,JHN,6,NRSV,the sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing
3145,JHN,6,NRSV,when they had rowed about three or four miles they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were terrified
3146,JHN,6,NRSV,but he said to them it is i do not be afraid
3147,JHN,6,NRSV,then they wanted to take him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going
3148,JHN,6,NRSV,the next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there
3149,JHN,6,NRSV,they also saw that jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone
3150,JHN,6,NRSV,then some boats from tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the lord had given thanks
3151,JHN,6,NRSV,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus
3152,JHN,6,NRSV,when they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him rabbi when did you come here
3153,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves
3154,JHN,6,NRSV,do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the son of man will give you
3155,JHN,6,NRSV,for it is on him that god the father has set his seal
3156,JHN,6,NRSV,then they said to him what must we do to perform the works of god
3157,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent
3158,JHN,6,NRSV,so they said to him what sign are you going to give us then so that we may see it and believe you
3159,JHN,6,NRSV,what work are you performing
3160,JHN,6,NRSV,our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
3161,JHN,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven
3162,JHN,6,NRSV,for the bread of god is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
3163,JHN,6,NRSV,they said to him sir give us this bread always
3164,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus said to them i am the bread of life
3165,JHN,6,NRSV,whoever comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty
3166,JHN,6,NRSV,but i said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe
3167,JHN,6,NRSV,everything that the father gives me will come to me and anyone who comes to me i will never drive away for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me
3168,JHN,6,NRSV,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day
3169,JHN,6,NRSV,this is indeed the will of my father that all who see the son and believe in him may have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day
3170,JHN,6,NRSV,then the jews began to complain about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven
3171,JHN,6,NRSV,they were saying is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know
3172,JHN,6,NRSV,how can he now say i have come down from heaven
3173,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them do not complain among yourselves
3174,JHN,6,NRSV,no one can come to me unless drawn by the father who sent me and i will raise that person up on the last day
3175,JHN,6,NRSV,it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught by god
3176,JHN,6,NRSV,everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me
3177,JHN,6,NRSV,not that anyone has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father
3178,JHN,6,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever believes has eternal life
3179,JHN,6,NRSV,i am the bread of life
3180,JHN,6,NRSV,your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and they died
3181,JHN,6,NRSV,this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die
3182,JHN,6,NRSV,i am the living bread that came down from heaven
3183,JHN,6,NRSV,whoever eats of this bread will live forever and the bread that i will give for the life of the world is my flesh
3184,JHN,6,NRSV,the jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat
3185,JHN,6,NRSV,so jesus said to them very truly i tell you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you
3186,JHN,6,NRSV,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
3187,JHN,6,NRSV,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me and i in them
3188,JHN,6,NRSV,just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so whoever eats me will live because of me
3189,JHN,6,NRSV,this is the bread that came down from heaven not like that which your ancestors ate and they died
3190,JHN,6,NRSV,but the one who eats this bread will live forever
3191,JHN,6,NRSV,he said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at capernaum
3192,JHN,6,NRSV,when many of his disciples heard it they said this teaching is difficult who can accept it
3193,JHN,6,NRSV,but jesus being aware that his disciples were complaining about it said to them does this offend you
3194,JHN,6,NRSV,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before
3195,JHN,6,NRSV,it is the spirit that gives life the flesh is useless
3196,JHN,6,NRSV,the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life
3197,JHN,6,NRSV,but among you there are some who do not believe
3198,JHN,6,NRSV,for jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe and who was the one that would betray him
3199,JHN,6,NRSV,and he said for this reason i have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the father
3200,JHN,6,NRSV,because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him
3201,JHN,6,NRSV,so jesus asked the twelve do you also wish to go away
3202,JHN,6,NRSV,simon peter answered him lord to whom can we go
3203,JHN,6,NRSV,you have the words of eternal life
3204,JHN,6,NRSV,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god
3205,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them did i not choose you the twelve
3206,JHN,6,NRSV,yet one of you is a devil
3207,JHN,6,NRSV,he was speaking of judas son of simon iscariot for he though one of the twelve was going to betray him
3208,JHN,7,NRSV,after this jesus went about in galilee
3209,JHN,7,NRSV,he did not wish to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him
3210,JHN,7,NRSV,now the jewish festival of booths was near
3211,JHN,7,NRSV,so his brothers said to him leave here and go to judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret
3212,JHN,7,NRSV,if you do these things show yourself to the world
3213,JHN,7,NRSV,for not even his brothers believed in him jesus said to them my time has not yet come but your time is always here
3214,JHN,7,NRSV,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil
3215,JHN,7,NRSV,go to the festival yourselves
3216,JHN,7,NRSV,i am not going to this festival for my time has not yet fully come
3217,JHN,7,NRSV,after saying this he remained in galilee
3218,JHN,7,NRSV,but after his brothers had gone to the festival then he also went not publicly but as it were in secret
3219,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were looking for him at the festival and saying where is he
3220,JHN,7,NRSV,and there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds
3221,JHN,7,NRSV,while some were saying he is a good man others were saying no he is deceiving the crowd
3222,JHN,7,NRSV,yet no one would speak openly about him for fear of the jews
3223,JHN,7,NRSV,about the middle of the festival jesus went up into the temple and began to teach
3224,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught
3225,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me
3226,JHN,7,NRSV,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own
3227,JHN,7,NRSV,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him
3228,JHN,7,NRSV,did not moses give you the law
3229,JHN,7,NRSV,yet none of you keeps the law
3230,JHN,7,NRSV,why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me
3231,JHN,7,NRSV,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you
3232,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus answered them i performed one work and all of you are astonished
3233,JHN,7,NRSV,moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath
3234,JHN,7,NRSV,if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of moses may not be broken are you angry with me because i healed a mans whole body on the sabbath
3235,JHN,7,NRSV,do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment
3236,JHN,7,NRSV,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill
3237,JHN,7,NRSV,and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah
3238,JHN,7,NRSV,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from
3239,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from
3240,JHN,7,NRSV,i have not come on my own
3241,JHN,7,NRSV,but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him
3242,JHN,7,NRSV,i know him because i am from him and he sent me
3243,JHN,7,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him but no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come
3244,JHN,7,NRSV,yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying when the messiah comes will he do more signs than this man has done
3245,JHN,7,NRSV,the pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him and the chief priests and pharisees sent temple police to arrest him
3246,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me
3247,JHN,7,NRSV,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
3248,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we will not find him
3249,JHN,7,NRSV,does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks
3250,JHN,7,NRSV,what does he mean by saying you will search for me and you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
3251,JHN,7,NRSV,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes in me drink
3252,JHN,7,NRSV,as the scripture has said out of the believers heart shall flow rivers of living water
3253,JHN,7,NRSV,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus was not yet glorified
3254,JHN,7,NRSV,when they heard these words some in the crowd said this is really the prophet
3255,JHN,7,NRSV,others said this is the messiah
3256,JHN,7,NRSV,but some asked surely the messiah does not come from galilee does he
3257,JHN,7,NRSV,has not the scripture said that the messiah is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived
3258,JHN,7,NRSV,so there was a division in the crowd because of him
3259,JHN,7,NRSV,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him
3260,JHN,7,NRSV,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him
3261,JHN,7,NRSV,the police answered never has anyone spoken like this then the pharisees replied surely you have not been deceived too have you
3262,JHN,7,NRSV,has any one of the authorities or of the pharisees believed in him
3263,JHN,7,NRSV,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed
3264,JHN,7,NRSV,nicodemus who had gone to jesus before and who was one of them asked our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it
3265,JHN,7,NRSV,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you
3266,JHN,7,NRSV,search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from galilee
3267,JHN,7,NRSV, then each of them went home
3268,JHN,8,NRSV,while jesus went to the mount of olives
3269,JHN,8,NRSV,early in the morning he came again to the temple
3270,JHN,8,NRSV,all the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them
3271,JHN,8,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and making her stand before all of them they said to him teacher this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery
3272,JHN,8,NRSV,now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women
3273,JHN,8,NRSV,now what do you say
3274,JHN,8,NRSV,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him
3275,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground
3276,JHN,8,NRSV,when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her
3277,JHN,8,NRSV,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground
3278,JHN,8,NRSV,when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the elders and jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him
3279,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus straightened up and said to her woman where are they
3280,JHN,8,NRSV,has no one condemned you
3281,JHN,8,NRSV,she said no one sir
3282,JHN,8,NRSV,and jesus said neither do i condemn you
3283,JHN,8,NRSV,go your way and from now on do not sin again again jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of the world
3284,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life
3285,JHN,8,NRSV,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid
3286,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid because i know where i have come from and where i am going but you do not know where i come from or where i am going
3287,JHN,8,NRSV,you judge by human standards i judge no one
3288,JHN,8,NRSV,yet even if i do judge my judgment is valid for it is not i alone who judge but i and the father who sent me
3289,JHN,8,NRSV,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid
3290,JHN,8,NRSV,i testify on my own behalf and the father who sent me testifies on my behalf
3291,JHN,8,NRSV,then they said to him where is your father
3292,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered you know neither me nor my father
3293,JHN,8,NRSV,if you knew me you would know my father also
3294,JHN,8,NRSV,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come
3295,JHN,8,NRSV,again he said to them i am going away and you will search for me but you will die in your sin
3296,JHN,8,NRSV,where i am going you cannot come
3297,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said is he going to kill himself
3298,JHN,8,NRSV,is that what he means by saying where i am going you cannot come
3299,JHN,8,NRSV,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world
3300,JHN,8,NRSV,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he
3301,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him who are you
3302,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all
3303,JHN,8,NRSV,i have much to say about you and much to condemn but the one who sent me is true and i declare to the world what i have heard from him
3304,JHN,8,NRSV,they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father
3305,JHN,8,NRSV,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me
3306,JHN,8,NRSV,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him
3307,JHN,8,NRSV,as he was saying these things many believed in him
3308,JHN,8,NRSV,then jesus said to the jews who had believed in him if you continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free
3309,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves to anyone
3310,JHN,8,NRSV,what do you mean by saying you will be made free
3311,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin
3312,JHN,8,NRSV,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever
3313,JHN,8,NRSV,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed
3314,JHN,8,NRSV,i know that you are descendants of abraham yet you look for an opportunity to kill me because there is no place in you for my word
3315,JHN,8,NRSV,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father
3316,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him abraham is our father
3317,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing what abraham did but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god
3318,JHN,8,NRSV,this is not what abraham did
3319,JHN,8,NRSV,you are indeed doing what your father does
3320,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself
3321,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here
3322,JHN,8,NRSV,i did not come on my own but he sent me
3323,JHN,8,NRSV,why do you not understand what i say
3324,JHN,8,NRSV,it is because you cannot accept my word
3325,JHN,8,NRSV,you are from your father the devil and you choose to do your fathers desires
3326,JHN,8,NRSV,he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him
3327,JHN,8,NRSV,when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies
3328,JHN,8,NRSV,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me
3329,JHN,8,NRSV,which of you convicts me of sin
3330,JHN,8,NRSV,if i tell the truth why do you not believe me
3331,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever is from god hears the words of god
3332,JHN,8,NRSV,the reason you do not hear them is that you are not from god
3333,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon
3334,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me
3335,JHN,8,NRSV,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge
3336,JHN,8,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever keeps my word will never see death
3337,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon
3338,JHN,8,NRSV,abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death
3339,JHN,8,NRSV,are you greater than our father abraham who died
3340,JHN,8,NRSV,the prophets also died
3341,JHN,8,NRSV,who do you claim to be
3342,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing
3343,JHN,8,NRSV,it is my father who glorifies me he of whom you say he is our god though you do not know him
3344,JHN,8,NRSV,but i know him if i would say that i do not know him i would be a liar like you
3345,JHN,8,NRSV,but i do know him and i keep his word
3346,JHN,8,NRSV,your ancestor abraham rejoiced that he would see my day he saw it and was glad
3347,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham
3348,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you before abraham was i am
3349,JHN,8,NRSV,so they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple
3350,JHN,9,NRSV,as he walked along he saw a man blind from birth
3351,JHN,9,NRSV,his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind
3352,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus answered neither this man nor his parents sinned he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him
3353,JHN,9,NRSV,we must work the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one can work
3354,JHN,9,NRSV,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
3355,JHN,9,NRSV,when he had said this he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the mans eyes saying to him go wash in the pool of siloam which means sent
3356,JHN,9,NRSV,then he went and washed and came back able to see
3357,JHN,9,NRSV,the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask is this not the man who used to sit and beg
3358,JHN,9,NRSV,some were saying it is he
3359,JHN,9,NRSV,others were saying no but it is someone like him
3360,JHN,9,NRSV,he kept saying i am the man
3361,JHN,9,NRSV,but they kept asking him then how were your eyes opened
3362,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash
3363,JHN,9,NRSV,then i went and washed and received my sight
3364,JHN,9,NRSV,they said to him where is he
3365,JHN,9,NRSV,he said i do not know
3366,JHN,9,NRSV,they brought to the pharisees the man who had formerly been blind
3367,JHN,9,NRSV,now it was a sabbath day when jesus made the mud and opened his eyes
3368,JHN,9,NRSV,then the pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight
3369,JHN,9,NRSV,he said to them he put mud on my eyes
3370,JHN,9,NRSV,then i washed and now i see
3371,JHN,9,NRSV,some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath
3372,JHN,9,NRSV,but others said how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs
3373,JHN,9,NRSV,and they were divided
3374,JHN,9,NRSV,so they said again to the blind man what do you say about him
3375,JHN,9,NRSV,it was your eyes he opened
3376,JHN,9,NRSV,he said he is a prophet
3377,JHN,9,NRSV,the jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them is this your son who you say was born blind
3378,JHN,9,NRSV,how then does he now see
3379,JHN,9,NRSV,his parents answered we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but we do not know how it is that now he sees nor do we know who opened his eyes
3380,JHN,9,NRSV,ask him he is of age
3381,JHN,9,NRSV,he will speak for himself
3382,JHN,9,NRSV,his parents said this because they were afraid of the jews for the jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed jesus to be the messiah would be put out of the synagogue
3383,JHN,9,NRSV,therefore his parents said he is of age ask him
3384,JHN,9,NRSV,so for the second time they called the man who had been blind and they said to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner
3385,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered i do not know whether he is a sinner
3386,JHN,9,NRSV,one thing i do know that though i was blind now i see
3387,JHN,9,NRSV,they said to him what did he do to you
3388,JHN,9,NRSV,how did he open your eyes
3389,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered them i have told you already and you would not listen
3390,JHN,9,NRSV,why do you want to hear it again
3391,JHN,9,NRSV,do you also want to become his disciples
3392,JHN,9,NRSV,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses
3393,JHN,9,NRSV,we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from
3394,JHN,9,NRSV,the man answered here is an astonishing thing you do not know where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes
3395,JHN,9,NRSV,we know that god does not listen to sinners but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will
3396,JHN,9,NRSV,never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind
3397,JHN,9,NRSV,if this man were not from god he could do nothing
3398,JHN,9,NRSV,they answered him you were born entirely in sins and are you trying to teach us
3399,JHN,9,NRSV,and they drove him out
3400,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus heard that they had driven him out and when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man
3401,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered and who is he sir
3402,JHN,9,NRSV,tell me so that i may believe in him
3403,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said to him you have seen him and the one speaking with you is he
3404,JHN,9,NRSV,he said lord i believe
3405,JHN,9,NRSV,and he worshiped him
3406,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind
3407,JHN,9,NRSV,some of the pharisees near him heard this and said to him surely we are not blind are we
3408,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were blind you would not have sin
3409,JHN,9,NRSV,but now that you say we see your sin remains
3410,JHN,10,NRSV,very truly i tell you anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit
3411,JHN,10,NRSV,the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep
3412,JHN,10,NRSV,the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep hear his voice
3413,JHN,10,NRSV,he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
3414,JHN,10,NRSV,when he has brought out all his own he goes ahead of them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice
3415,JHN,10,NRSV,they will not follow a stranger but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers
3416,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus used this figure of speech with them but they did not understand what he was saying to them
3417,JHN,10,NRSV,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep
3418,JHN,10,NRSV,all who came before me are thieves and bandits but the sheep did not listen to them
3419,JHN,10,NRSV,i am the gate
3420,JHN,10,NRSV,whoever enters by me will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture
3421,JHN,10,NRSV,the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy
3422,JHN,10,NRSV,i came that they may have life and have it abundantly
3423,JHN,10,NRSV,i am the good shepherd
3424,JHN,10,NRSV,the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
3425,JHN,10,NRSV,the hired hand who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs awayand the wolf snatches them and scatters them
3426,JHN,10,NRSV,the hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep
3427,JHN,10,NRSV,i am the good shepherd
3428,JHN,10,NRSV,i know my own and my own know me just as the father knows me and i know the father
3429,JHN,10,NRSV,and i lay down my life for the sheep
3430,JHN,10,NRSV,i have other sheep that do not belong to this fold
3431,JHN,10,NRSV,i must bring them also and they will listen to my voice
3432,JHN,10,NRSV,so there will be one flock one shepherd
3433,JHN,10,NRSV,for this reason the father loves me because i lay down my life in order to take it up again
3434,JHN,10,NRSV,no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord
3435,JHN,10,NRSV,i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again
3436,JHN,10,NRSV,i have received this command from my father
3437,JHN,10,NRSV,again the jews were divided because of these words
3438,JHN,10,NRSV,many of them were saying he has a demon and is out of his mind
3439,JHN,10,NRSV,why listen to him
3440,JHN,10,NRSV,others were saying these are not the words of one who has a demon
3441,JHN,10,NRSV,can a demon open the eyes of the blind
3442,JHN,10,NRSV,at that time the festival of the dedication took place in jerusalem
3443,JHN,10,NRSV,it was winter and jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of solomon
3444,JHN,10,NRSV,so the jews gathered around him and said to him how long will you keep us in suspense
3445,JHN,10,NRSV,if you are the messiah tell us plainly
3446,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus answered i have told you and you do not believe
3447,JHN,10,NRSV,the works that i do in my fathers name testify to me but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep
3448,JHN,10,NRSV,my sheep hear my voice
3449,JHN,10,NRSV,i know them and they follow me
3450,JHN,10,NRSV,i give them eternal life and they will never perish
3451,JHN,10,NRSV,no one will snatch them out of my hand
3452,JHN,10,NRSV,what my father has given me is greater than all else and no one can snatch it out of the fathers hand
3453,JHN,10,NRSV,the father and i are one
3454,JHN,10,NRSV,the jews took up stones again to stone him
3455,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus replied i have shown you many good works from the father
3456,JHN,10,NRSV,for which of these are you going to stone me
3457,JHN,10,NRSV,the jews answered it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you though only a human being are making yourself god
3458,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus answered is it not written in your law i said you are gods
3459,JHN,10,NRSV,if those to whom the word of god came were called godsand the scripture cannot be annulled can you say that the one whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because i said i am gods son
3460,JHN,10,NRSV,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me
3461,JHN,10,NRSV,but if i do them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i am in the father
3462,JHN,10,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him again but he escaped from their hands
3463,JHN,10,NRSV,he went away again across the jordan to the place where john had been baptizing earlier and he remained there
3464,JHN,10,NRSV,many came to him and they were saying john performed no sign but everything that john said about this man was true
3465,JHN,10,NRSV,and many believed in him there
3466,JHN,11,NRSV,now a certain man was ill lazarus of bethany the village of mary and her sister martha
3467,JHN,11,NRSV,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill
3468,JHN,11,NRSV,so the sisters sent a message to jesus lord he whom you love is ill
3469,JHN,11,NRSV,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it
3470,JHN,11,NRSV,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus after having heard that lazarus was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was
3471,JHN,11,NRSV,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again
3472,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him rabbi the jews were just now trying to stone you and are you going there again
3473,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight
3474,JHN,11,NRSV,those who walk during the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world
3475,JHN,11,NRSV,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them
3476,JHN,11,NRSV,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him
3477,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right
3478,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus however had been speaking about his death but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep
3479,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus told them plainly lazarus is dead
3480,JHN,11,NRSV,for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe
3481,JHN,11,NRSV,but let us go to him
3482,JHN,11,NRSV,thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him
3483,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb four days
3484,JHN,11,NRSV,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles away and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother
3485,JHN,11,NRSV,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home
3486,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
3487,JHN,11,NRSV,but even now i know that god will give you whatever you ask of him
3488,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her your brother will rise again
3489,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day
3490,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life
3491,JHN,11,NRSV,those who believe in me even though they die will live and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die
3492,JHN,11,NRSV,do you believe this
3493,JHN,11,NRSV,she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the messiah the son of god the one coming into the world
3494,JHN,11,NRSV,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you
3495,JHN,11,NRSV,and when she heard it she got up quickly and went to him
3496,JHN,11,NRSV,now jesus had not yet come to the village but was still at the place where martha had met him
3497,JHN,11,NRSV,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out
3498,JHN,11,NRSV,they followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there
3499,JHN,11,NRSV,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
3500,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved
3501,JHN,11,NRSV,he said where have you laid him
3502,JHN,11,NRSV,they said to him lord come and see
3503,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus began to weep
3504,JHN,11,NRSV,so the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying
3505,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus again greatly disturbed came to the tomb
3506,JHN,11,NRSV,it was a cave and a stone was lying against it
3507,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said take away the stone
3508,JHN,11,NRSV,martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days
3509,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god
3510,JHN,11,NRSV,so they took away the stone
3511,JHN,11,NRSV,and jesus looked upward and said father i thank you for having heard me
3512,JHN,11,NRSV,i knew that you always hear me but i have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me
3513,JHN,11,NRSV,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth
3514,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to them unbind him and let him go
3515,JHN,11,NRSV,many of the jews therefore who had come with mary and had seen what jesus did believed in him
3516,JHN,11,NRSV,but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what he had done
3517,JHN,11,NRSV,so the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the council and said what are we to do
3518,JHN,11,NRSV,this man is performing many signs
3519,JHN,11,NRSV,if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation
3520,JHN,11,NRSV,but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all you do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed
3521,JHN,11,NRSV,he did not say this on his own but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus was about to die for the nation and not for the nation only but to gather into one the dispersed children of god
3522,JHN,11,NRSV,so from that day on they planned to put him to death
3523,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the jews but went from there to a town called ephraim in the region near the wilderness and he remained there with the disciples
3524,JHN,11,NRSV,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves
3525,JHN,11,NRSV,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think
3526,JHN,11,NRSV,surely he will not come to the festival will he
3527,JHN,11,NRSV,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him
3528,JHN,12,NRSV,six days before the passover jesus came to bethany the home of lazarus whom he had raised from the dead
3529,JHN,12,NRSV,there they gave a dinner for him
3530,JHN,12,NRSV,martha served and lazarus was one of those at the table with him
3531,JHN,12,NRSV,mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard anointed jesus feet and wiped them with her hair
3532,JHN,12,NRSV,the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume
3533,JHN,12,NRSV,but judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor
3534,JHN,12,NRSV,he said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it jesus said leave her alone
3535,JHN,12,NRSV,she bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial
3536,JHN,12,NRSV,you always have the poor with you but you do not always have me
3537,JHN,12,NRSV,when the great crowd of the jews learned that he was there they came not only because of jesus but also to see lazarus whom he had raised from the dead
3538,JHN,12,NRSV,so the chief priests planned to put lazarus to death as well since it was on account of him that many of the jews were deserting and were believing in jesus
3539,JHN,12,NRSV,the next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
3540,JHN,12,NRSV,so they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him shouting hosanna blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord the king of israel jesus found a young donkey and sat on it as it is written do not be afraid daughter of zion
3541,JHN,12,NRSV,look your king is coming sitting on a donkeys colt his disciples did not understand these things at first but when jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him
3542,JHN,12,NRSV,so the crowd that had been with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify
3543,JHN,12,NRSV,it was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him
3544,JHN,12,NRSV,the pharisees then said to one another you see you can do nothing
3545,JHN,12,NRSV,look the world has gone after him now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some greeks
3546,JHN,12,NRSV,they came to philip who was from bethsaida in galilee and said to him sir we wish to see jesus
3547,JHN,12,NRSV,philip went and told andrew then andrew and philip went and told jesus
3548,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus answered them the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified
3549,JHN,12,NRSV,very truly i tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain but if it dies it bears much fruit
3550,JHN,12,NRSV,those who love their life lose it and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life
3551,JHN,12,NRSV,whoever serves me must follow me and where i am there will my servant be also
3552,JHN,12,NRSV,whoever serves me the father will honor
3553,JHN,12,NRSV,now my soul is troubled
3554,JHN,12,NRSV,and what should i sayfather save me from this hour
3555,JHN,12,NRSV,no it is for this reason that i have come to this hour
3556,JHN,12,NRSV,father glorify your name
3557,JHN,12,NRSV,then a voice came from heaven i have glorified it and i will glorify it again
3558,JHN,12,NRSV,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder
3559,JHN,12,NRSV,others said an angel has spoken to him
3560,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus answered this voice has come for your sake not for mine
3561,JHN,12,NRSV,now is the judgment of this world now the ruler of this world will be driven out
3562,JHN,12,NRSV,and i when i am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself
3563,JHN,12,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die
3564,JHN,12,NRSV,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah remains forever
3565,JHN,12,NRSV,how can you say that the son of man must be lifted up
3566,JHN,12,NRSV,who is this son of man
3567,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus said to them the light is with you for a little longer
3568,JHN,12,NRSV,walk while you have the light so that the darkness may not overtake you
3569,JHN,12,NRSV,if you walk in the darkness you do not know where you are going
3570,JHN,12,NRSV,while you have the light believe in the light so that you may become children of light
3571,JHN,12,NRSV,after jesus had said this he departed and hid from them
3572,JHN,12,NRSV,although he had performed so many signs in their presence they did not believe in him
3573,JHN,12,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet isaiah lord who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed
3574,JHN,12,NRSV,and so they could not believe because isaiah also said he has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart so that they might not look with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them
3575,JHN,12,NRSV,isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him
3576,JHN,12,NRSV,nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him
3577,JHN,12,NRSV,but because of the pharisees they did not confess it for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue for they loved human glory more than the glory that comes from god
3578,JHN,12,NRSV,then jesus cried aloud whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me
3579,JHN,12,NRSV,and whoever sees me sees him who sent me
3580,JHN,12,NRSV,i have come as light into the world so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness
3581,JHN,12,NRSV,i do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
3582,JHN,12,NRSV,the one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge on the last day the word that i have spoken will serve as judge for i have not spoken on my own but the father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak
3583,JHN,12,NRSV,and i know that his commandment is eternal life
3584,JHN,12,NRSV,what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me
3585,JHN,13,NRSV,now before the festival of the passover jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the father
3586,JHN,13,NRSV,having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end
3587,JHN,13,NRSV,the devil had already put it into the heart of judas son of simon iscariot to betray him
3588,JHN,13,NRSV,and during supper jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god got up from the table took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself
3589,JHN,13,NRSV,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him
3590,JHN,13,NRSV,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet
3591,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand
3592,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him you will never wash my feet
3593,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me
3594,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him one who has bathed does not need to wash except for the feet but is entirely clean
3595,JHN,13,NRSV,and you are clean though not all of you
3596,JHN,13,NRSV,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean
3597,JHN,13,NRSV,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you
3598,JHN,13,NRSV,you call me teacher and lordand you are right for that is what i am
3599,JHN,13,NRSV,so if i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet
3600,JHN,13,NRSV,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you
3601,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you servants are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them
3602,JHN,13,NRSV,if you know these things you are blessed if you do them
3603,JHN,13,NRSV,i am not speaking of all of you i know whom i have chosen
3604,JHN,13,NRSV,but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me
3605,JHN,13,NRSV,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he
3606,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me
3607,JHN,13,NRSV,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me
3608,JHN,13,NRSV,the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he was speaking
3609,JHN,13,NRSV,one of his disciplesthe one whom jesus lovedwas reclining next to him simon peter therefore motioned to him to ask jesus of whom he was speaking
3610,JHN,13,NRSV,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it
3611,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered it is the one to whom i give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish
3612,JHN,13,NRSV,so when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot
3613,JHN,13,NRSV,after he received the piece of bread satan entered into him
3614,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do
3615,JHN,13,NRSV,now no one at the table knew why he said this to him
3616,JHN,13,NRSV,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor
3617,JHN,13,NRSV,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out
3618,JHN,13,NRSV,and it was night
3619,JHN,13,NRSV,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him
3620,JHN,13,NRSV,if god has been glorified in him god will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once
3621,JHN,13,NRSV,little children i am with you only a little longer
3622,JHN,13,NRSV,you will look for me and as i said to the jews so now i say to you where i am going you cannot come
3623,JHN,13,NRSV,i give you a new commandment that you love one another
3624,JHN,13,NRSV,just as i have loved you you also should love one another
3625,JHN,13,NRSV,by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
3626,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord where are you going
3627,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow afterward
3628,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now
3629,JHN,13,NRSV,i will lay down my life for you
3630,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered will you lay down your life for me
3631,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you before the cock crows you will have denied me three times
3632,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled
3633,JHN,14,NRSV,believe in god believe also in me
3634,JHN,14,NRSV,in my fathers house there are many dwelling places
3635,JHN,14,NRSV,if it were not so would i have told you that i go to prepare a place for you
3636,JHN,14,NRSV,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself so that where i am there you may be also
3637,JHN,14,NRSV,and you know the way to the place where i am going
3638,JHN,14,NRSV,thomas said to him lord we do not know where you are going
3639,JHN,14,NRSV,how can we know the way
3640,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life
3641,JHN,14,NRSV,no one comes to the father except through me
3642,JHN,14,NRSV,if you know me you will know my father also
3643,JHN,14,NRSV,from now on you do know him and have seen him
3644,JHN,14,NRSV,philip said to him lord show us the father and we will be satisfied
3645,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him have i been with you all this time philip and you still do not know me
3646,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever has seen me has seen the father
3647,JHN,14,NRSV,how can you say show us the father
3648,JHN,14,NRSV,do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me
3649,JHN,14,NRSV,the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own but the father who dwells in me does his works
3650,JHN,14,NRSV,believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me but if you do not then believe me because of the works themselves
3651,JHN,14,NRSV,very truly i tell you the one who believes in me will also do the works that i do and in fact will do greater works than these because i am going to the father
3652,JHN,14,NRSV,i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son
3653,JHN,14,NRSV,if in my name you ask me for anything i will do it
3654,JHN,14,NRSV,if you love me you will keep my commandments
3655,JHN,14,NRSV,and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you forever
3656,JHN,14,NRSV,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him
3657,JHN,14,NRSV,you know him because he abides with you and he will be in you
3658,JHN,14,NRSV,i will not leave you orphaned i am coming to you
3659,JHN,14,NRSV,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live
3660,JHN,14,NRSV,on that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you
3661,JHN,14,NRSV,they who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me and those who love me will be loved by my father and i will love them and reveal myself to them
3662,JHN,14,NRSV,judas not iscariot said to him lord how is it that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world
3663,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus answered him those who love me will keep my word and my father will love them and we will come to them and make our home with them
3664,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me
3665,JHN,14,NRSV,i have said these things to you while i am still with you
3666,JHN,14,NRSV,but the advocate the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you
3667,JHN,14,NRSV,peace i leave with you my peace i give to you
3668,JHN,14,NRSV,i do not give to you as the world gives
3669,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled and do not let them be afraid
3670,JHN,14,NRSV,you heard me say to you i am going away and i am coming to you
3671,JHN,14,NRSV,if you loved me you would rejoice that i am going to the father because the father is greater than i
3672,JHN,14,NRSV,and now i have told you this before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe
3673,JHN,14,NRSV,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming
3674,JHN,14,NRSV,he has no power over me but i do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that i love the father
3675,JHN,14,NRSV,rise let us be on our way
3676,JHN,15,NRSV,i am the true vine and my father is the vinegrower
3677,JHN,15,NRSV,he removes every branch in me that bears no fruit
3678,JHN,15,NRSV,every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit
3679,JHN,15,NRSV,you have already been cleansed by the word that i have spoken to you
3680,JHN,15,NRSV,abide in me as i abide in you
3681,JHN,15,NRSV,just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me
3682,JHN,15,NRSV,i am the vine you are the branches
3683,JHN,15,NRSV,those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing
3684,JHN,15,NRSV,whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers such branches are gathered thrown into the fire and burned
3685,JHN,15,NRSV,if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask for whatever you wish and it will be done for you
3686,JHN,15,NRSV,my father is glorified by this that you bear much fruit and become my disciples
3687,JHN,15,NRSV,as the father has loved me so i have loved you abide in my love
3688,JHN,15,NRSV,if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
3689,JHN,15,NRSV,i have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete
3690,JHN,15,NRSV,this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you
3691,JHN,15,NRSV,no one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends
3692,JHN,15,NRSV,you are my friends if you do what i command you
3693,JHN,15,NRSV,i do not call you servants any longer because the servant does not know what the master is doing but i have called you friends because i have made known to you everything that i have heard from my father
3694,JHN,15,NRSV,you did not choose me but i chose you
3695,JHN,15,NRSV,and i appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last so that the father will give you whatever you ask him in my name
3696,JHN,15,NRSV,i am giving you these commands so that you may love one another
3697,JHN,15,NRSV,if the world hates you be aware that it hated me before it hated you
3698,JHN,15,NRSV,if you belonged to the world the world would love you as its own
3699,JHN,15,NRSV,because you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hates you
3700,JHN,15,NRSV,remember the word that i said to you servants are not greater than their master
3701,JHN,15,NRSV,if they persecuted me they will persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also
3702,JHN,15,NRSV,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
3703,JHN,15,NRSV,if i had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin but now they have no excuse for their sin
3704,JHN,15,NRSV,whoever hates me hates my father also
3705,JHN,15,NRSV,if i had not done among them the works that no one else did they would not have sin
3706,JHN,15,NRSV,but now they have seen and hated both me and my father
3707,JHN,15,NRSV,it was to fulfill the word that is written in their law they hated me without a cause
3708,JHN,15,NRSV,when the advocate comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who comes from the father he will testify on my behalf
3709,JHN,15,NRSV,you also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning
3710,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling
3711,JHN,16,NRSV,they will put you out of the synagogues
3712,JHN,16,NRSV,indeed an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to god
3713,JHN,16,NRSV,and they will do this because they have not known the father or me
3714,JHN,16,NRSV,but i have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that i told you about them
3715,JHN,16,NRSV,i did not say these things to you from the beginning because i was with you
3716,JHN,16,NRSV,but now i am going to him who sent me yet none of you asks me where are you going
3717,JHN,16,NRSV,but because i have said these things to you sorrow has filled your hearts
3718,JHN,16,NRSV,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the advocate will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you
3719,JHN,16,NRSV,and when he comes he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment about sin because they do not believe in me about righteousness because i am going to the father and you will see me no longer about judgment because the ruler of this world has been condemned
3720,JHN,16,NRSV,i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
3721,JHN,16,NRSV,when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak on his own but will speak whatever he hears and he will declare to you the things that are to come
3722,JHN,16,NRSV,he will glorify me because he will take what is mine and declare it to you
3723,JHN,16,NRSV,all that the father has is mine
3724,JHN,16,NRSV,for this reason i said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you
3725,JHN,16,NRSV,a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me
3726,JHN,16,NRSV,then some of his disciples said to one another what does he mean by saying to us a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me and because i am going to the father
3727,JHN,16,NRSV,they said what does he mean by this a little while
3728,JHN,16,NRSV,we do not know what he is talking about
3729,JHN,16,NRSV,jesus knew that they wanted to ask him so he said to them are you discussing among yourselves what i meant when i said a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me
3730,JHN,16,NRSV,very truly i tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice you will have pain but your pain will turn into joy
3731,JHN,16,NRSV,when a woman is in labor she has pain because her hour has come
3732,JHN,16,NRSV,but when her child is born she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world
3733,JHN,16,NRSV,so you have pain now but i will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take your joy from you
3734,JHN,16,NRSV,on that day you will ask nothing of me
3735,JHN,16,NRSV,very truly i tell you if you ask anything of the father in my name he will give it to you
3736,JHN,16,NRSV,until now you have not asked for anything in my name
3737,JHN,16,NRSV,ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete
3738,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said these things to you in figures of speech
3739,JHN,16,NRSV,the hour is coming when i will no longer speak to you in figures but will tell you plainly of the father
3740,JHN,16,NRSV,on that day you will ask in my name
3741,JHN,16,NRSV,i do not say to you that i will ask the father on your behalf for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came from god
3742,JHN,16,NRSV,i came from the father and have come into the world again i am leaving the world and am going to the father
3743,JHN,16,NRSV,his disciples said yes now you are speaking plainly not in any figure of speech now we know that you know all things and do not need to have anyone question you by this we believe that you came from god
3744,JHN,16,NRSV,jesus answered them do you now believe
3745,JHN,16,NRSV,the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each one to his home and you will leave me alone
3746,JHN,16,NRSV,yet i am not alone because the father is with me
3747,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said this to you so that in me you may have peace
3748,JHN,16,NRSV,in the world you face persecution
3749,JHN,16,NRSV,but take courage i have conquered the world
3750,JHN,17,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he looked up to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify your son so that the son may glorify you since you have given him authority over all people to give eternal life to all whom you have given him
3751,JHN,17,NRSV,and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
3752,JHN,17,NRSV,i glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do
3753,JHN,17,NRSV,so now father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that i had in your presence before the world existed
3754,JHN,17,NRSV,i have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world
3755,JHN,17,NRSV,they were yours and you gave them to me and they have kept your word
3756,JHN,17,NRSV,now they know that everything you have given me is from you for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me
3757,JHN,17,NRSV,i am asking on their behalf i am not asking on behalf of the world but on behalf of those whom you gave me because they are yours
3758,JHN,17,NRSV,all mine are yours and yours are mine and i have been glorified in them
3759,JHN,17,NRSV,and now i am no longer in the world but they are in the world and i am coming to you
3760,JHN,17,NRSV,holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one
3761,JHN,17,NRSV,while i was with them i protected them in your name that you have given me
3762,JHN,17,NRSV,i guarded them and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost so that the scripture might be fulfilled
3763,JHN,17,NRSV,but now i am coming to you and i speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves
3764,JHN,17,NRSV,i have given them your word and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world
3765,JHN,17,NRSV,i am not asking you to take them out of the world but i ask you to protect them from the evil one
3766,JHN,17,NRSV,they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world
3767,JHN,17,NRSV,sanctify them in the truth your word is truth
3768,JHN,17,NRSV,as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world
3769,JHN,17,NRSV,and for their sakes i sanctify myself so that they also may be sanctified in truth
3770,JHN,17,NRSV,i ask not only on behalf of these but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word that they may all be one
3771,JHN,17,NRSV,as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me
3772,JHN,17,NRSV,the glory that you have given me i have given them so that they may be one as we are one i in them and you in me that they may become completely one so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me
3773,JHN,17,NRSV,father i desire that those also whom you have given me may be with me where i am to see my glory which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world
3774,JHN,17,NRSV,righteous father the world does not know you but i know you and these know that you have sent me
3775,JHN,17,NRSV,i made your name known to them and i will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them and i in them
3776,JHN,18,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples across the kidron valley to a place where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered
3777,JHN,18,NRSV,now judas who betrayed him also knew the place because jesus often met there with his disciples
3778,JHN,18,NRSV,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons
3779,JHN,18,NRSV,then jesus knowing all that was to happen to him came forward and asked them whom are you looking for
3780,JHN,18,NRSV,they answered jesus of nazareth
3781,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus replied i am he
3782,JHN,18,NRSV,judas who betrayed him was standing with them
3783,JHN,18,NRSV,when jesus said to them i am he they stepped back and fell to the ground
3784,JHN,18,NRSV,again he asked them whom are you looking for
3785,JHN,18,NRSV,and they said jesus of nazareth
3786,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i told you that i am he
3787,JHN,18,NRSV,so if you are looking for me let these men go
3788,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word that he had spoken i did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me
3789,JHN,18,NRSV,then simon peter who had a sword drew it struck the high priests slave and cut off his right ear
3790,JHN,18,NRSV,the slaves name was malchus
3791,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus said to peter put your sword back into its sheath
3792,JHN,18,NRSV,am i not to drink the cup that the father has given me
3793,JHN,18,NRSV,so the soldiers their officer and the jewish police arrested jesus and bound him
3794,JHN,18,NRSV,first they took him to annas who was the fatherinlaw of caiaphas the high priest that year
3795,JHN,18,NRSV,caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it was better to have one person die for the people
3796,JHN,18,NRSV,simon peter and another disciple followed jesus
3797,JHN,18,NRSV,since that disciple was known to the high priest he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest but peter was standing outside at the gate
3798,JHN,18,NRSV,so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out spoke to the woman who guarded the gate and brought peter in
3799,JHN,18,NRSV,the woman said to peter you are not also one of this mans disciples are you
3800,JHN,18,NRSV,he said i am not
3801,JHN,18,NRSV,now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing around it and warming themselves
3802,JHN,18,NRSV,peter also was standing with them and warming himself
3803,JHN,18,NRSV,then the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching
3804,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i have spoken openly to the world i have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together
3805,JHN,18,NRSV,i have said nothing in secret
3806,JHN,18,NRSV,why do you ask me
3807,JHN,18,NRSV,ask those who heard what i said to them they know what i said
3808,JHN,18,NRSV,when he had said this one of the police standing nearby struck jesus on the face saying is that how you answer the high priest
3809,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered if i have spoken wrongly testify to the wrong
3810,JHN,18,NRSV,but if i have spoken rightly why do you strike me
3811,JHN,18,NRSV,then annas sent him bound to caiaphas the high priest
3812,JHN,18,NRSV,now simon peter was standing and warming himself
3813,JHN,18,NRSV,they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you
3814,JHN,18,NRSV,he denied it and said i am not
3815,JHN,18,NRSV,one of the slaves of the high priest a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off asked did i not see you in the garden with him
3816,JHN,18,NRSV,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed
3817,JHN,18,NRSV,then they took jesus from caiaphas to pilates headquarters
3818,JHN,18,NRSV,it was early in the morning
3819,JHN,18,NRSV,they themselves did not enter the headquarters so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover
3820,JHN,18,NRSV,so pilate went out to them and said what accusation do you bring against this man
3821,JHN,18,NRSV,they answered if this man were not a criminal we would not have handed him over to you
3822,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law
3823,JHN,18,NRSV,the jews replied we are not permitted to put anyone to death
3824,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill what jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die then pilate entered the headquarters again summoned jesus and asked him are you the king of the jews
3825,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered do you ask this on your own or did others tell you about me
3826,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate replied i am not a jew am i
3827,JHN,18,NRSV,your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me
3828,JHN,18,NRSV,what have you done
3829,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered my kingdom is not from this world
3830,JHN,18,NRSV,if my kingdom were from this world my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the jews
3831,JHN,18,NRSV,but as it is my kingdom is not from here
3832,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him so you are a king
3833,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered you say that i am a king
3834,JHN,18,NRSV,for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth
3835,JHN,18,NRSV,everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice
3836,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him what is truth
3837,JHN,18,NRSV,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him
3838,JHN,18,NRSV,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover
3839,JHN,18,NRSV,do you want me to release for you the king of the jews
3840,JHN,18,NRSV,they shouted in reply not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a bandit
3841,JHN,19,NRSV,then pilate took jesus and had him flogged
3842,JHN,19,NRSV,and the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they dressed him in a purple robe
3843,JHN,19,NRSV,they kept coming up to him saying hail king of the jews and striking him on the face
3844,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate went out again and said to them look i am bringing him out to you to let you know that i find no case against him
3845,JHN,19,NRSV,so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe
3846,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate said to them here is the man when the chief priests and the police saw him they shouted crucify him crucify him pilate said to them take him yourselves and crucify him i find no case against him
3847,JHN,19,NRSV,the jews answered him we have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the son of god
3848,JHN,19,NRSV,now when pilate heard this he was more afraid than ever
3849,JHN,19,NRSV,he entered his headquarters again and asked jesus where are you from
3850,JHN,19,NRSV,but jesus gave him no answer
3851,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate therefore said to him do you refuse to speak to me
3852,JHN,19,NRSV,do you not know that i have power to release you and power to crucify you
3853,JHN,19,NRSV,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin
3854,JHN,19,NRSV,from then on pilate tried to release him but the jews cried out if you release this man you are no friend of the emperor
3855,JHN,19,NRSV,everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor
3856,JHN,19,NRSV,when pilate heard these words he brought jesus outside and sat on the judges bench at a place called the stone pavement or in hebrew gabbatha
3857,JHN,19,NRSV,now it was the day of preparation for the passover and it was about noon
3858,JHN,19,NRSV,he said to the jews here is your king they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate asked them shall i crucify your king
3859,JHN,19,NRSV,the chief priests answered we have no king but the emperor
3860,JHN,19,NRSV,then he handed him over to them to be crucified
3861,JHN,19,NRSV,so they took jesus and carrying the cross by himself he went out to what is called the place of the skull which in hebrew is called golgotha
3862,JHN,19,NRSV,there they crucified him and with him two others one on either side with jesus between them
3863,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross
3864,JHN,19,NRSV,it read jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
3865,JHN,19,NRSV,many of the jews read this inscription because the place where jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in hebrew in latin and in greek
3866,JHN,19,NRSV,then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not write the king of the jews but this man said i am king of the jews
3867,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate answered what i have written i have written
3868,JHN,19,NRSV,when the soldiers had crucified jesus they took his clothes and divided them into four parts one for each soldier
3869,JHN,19,NRSV,they also took his tunic now the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from the top
3870,JHN,19,NRSV,so they said to one another let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see who will get it
3871,JHN,19,NRSV,this was to fulfill what the scripture says they divided my clothes among themselves and for my clothing they cast lots
3872,JHN,19,NRSV,and that is what the soldiers did
3873,JHN,19,NRSV,meanwhile standing near the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene
3874,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her he said to his mother woman here is your son
3875,JHN,19,NRSV,then he said to the disciple here is your mother
3876,JHN,19,NRSV,and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home
3877,JHN,19,NRSV,after this when jesus knew that all was now finished he said in order to fulfill the scripture i am thirsty
3878,JHN,19,NRSV,a jar full of sour wine was standing there
3879,JHN,19,NRSV,so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth
3880,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus had received the wine he said it is finished
3881,JHN,19,NRSV,then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit
3882,JHN,19,NRSV,since it was the day of preparation the jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity
3883,JHN,19,NRSV,so they asked pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed
3884,JHN,19,NRSV,then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him
3885,JHN,19,NRSV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs
3886,JHN,19,NRSV,instead one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and at once blood and water came out
3887,JHN,19,NRSV,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe
3888,JHN,19,NRSV,his testimony is true and he knows that he tells the truth these things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled none of his bones shall be broken
3889,JHN,19,NRSV,and again another passage of scripture says they will look on the one whom they have pierced
3890,JHN,19,NRSV,after these things joseph of arimathea who was a disciple of jesus though a secret one because of his fear of the jews asked pilate to let him take away the body of jesus
3891,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate gave him permission so he came and removed his body
3892,JHN,19,NRSV,nicodemus who had at first come to jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds
3893,JHN,19,NRSV,they took the body of jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths according to the burial custom of the jews
3894,JHN,19,NRSV,now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid
3895,JHN,19,NRSV,and so because it was the jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there
3896,JHN,20,NRSV,early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb
3897,JHN,20,NRSV,so she ran and went to simon peter and the other disciple the one whom jesus loved and said to them they have taken the lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him
3898,JHN,20,NRSV,then peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb
3899,JHN,20,NRSV,the two were running together but the other disciple outran peter and reached the tomb first
3900,JHN,20,NRSV,he bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there but he did not go in
3901,JHN,20,NRSV,then simon peter came following him and went into the tomb
3902,JHN,20,NRSV,he saw the linen wrappings lying there and the cloth that had been on jesus head not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself
3903,JHN,20,NRSV,then the other disciple who reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead
3904,JHN,20,NRSV,then the disciples returned to their homes
3905,JHN,20,NRSV,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb
3906,JHN,20,NRSV,as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet
3907,JHN,20,NRSV,they said to her woman why are you weeping
3908,JHN,20,NRSV,she said to them they have taken away my lord and i do not know where they have laid him
3909,JHN,20,NRSV,when she had said this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not know that it was jesus
3910,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping
3911,JHN,20,NRSV,whom are you looking for
3912,JHN,20,NRSV,supposing him to be the gardener she said to him sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have laid him and i will take him away
3913,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in hebrew rabbouni which means teacher
3914,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her do not hold on to me because i have not yet ascended to the father
3915,JHN,20,NRSV,but go to my brothers and say to them i am ascending to my father and your father to my god and your god
3916,JHN,20,NRSV,mary magdalene went and announced to the disciples i have seen the lord and she told them that he had said these things to her
3917,JHN,20,NRSV,when it was evening on that day the first day of the week and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the jews jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you
3918,JHN,20,NRSV,after he said this he showed them his hands and his side
3919,JHN,20,NRSV,then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the lord
3920,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to them again peace be with you
3921,JHN,20,NRSV,as the father has sent me so i send you
3922,JHN,20,NRSV,when he had said this he breathed on them and said to them receive the holy spirit
3923,JHN,20,NRSV,if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven them if you retain the sins of any they are retained
3924,JHN,20,NRSV,but thomas who was called the twin one of the twelve was not with them when jesus came
3925,JHN,20,NRSV,so the other disciples told him we have seen the lord
3926,JHN,20,NRSV,but he said to them unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe
3927,JHN,20,NRSV,a week later his disciples were again in the house and thomas was with them
3928,JHN,20,NRSV,although the doors were shut jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you
3929,JHN,20,NRSV,then he said to thomas put your finger here and see my hands
3930,JHN,20,NRSV,reach out your hand and put it in my side
3931,JHN,20,NRSV,do not doubt but believe
3932,JHN,20,NRSV,thomas answered him my lord and my god jesus said to him have you believed because you have seen me
3933,JHN,20,NRSV,blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe
3934,JHN,20,NRSV,now jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book
3935,JHN,20,NRSV,but these are written so that you may come to believe that jesus is the messiah the son of god and that through believing you may have life in his name
3936,JHN,21,NRSV,after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the sea of tiberias and he showed himself in this way
3937,JHN,21,NRSV,gathered there together were simon peter thomas called the twin nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples
3938,JHN,21,NRSV,simon peter said to them i am going fishing
3939,JHN,21,NRSV,they said to him we will go with you
3940,JHN,21,NRSV,they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing
3941,JHN,21,NRSV,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus
3942,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them children you have no fish have you
3943,JHN,21,NRSV,they answered him no he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some
3944,JHN,21,NRSV,so they cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish
3945,JHN,21,NRSV,that disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord when simon peter heard that it was the lord he put on some clothes for he was naked and jumped into the sea
3946,JHN,21,NRSV,but the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not far from the land only about a hundred yards off
3947,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had gone ashore they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and bread
3948,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them bring some of the fish that you have just caught
3949,JHN,21,NRSV,so simon peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish a hundred fiftythree of them and though there were so many the net was not torn
3950,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them come and have breakfast
3951,JHN,21,NRSV,now none of the disciples dared to ask him who are you
3952,JHN,21,NRSV,because they knew it was the lord
3953,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish
3954,JHN,21,NRSV,this was now the third time that jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead
3955,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had finished breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these
3956,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you
3957,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him feed my lambs
3958,JHN,21,NRSV,a second time he said to him simon son of john do you love me
3959,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him yes lord you know that i love you
3960,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him tend my sheep
3961,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me
3962,JHN,21,NRSV,peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time do you love me
3963,JHN,21,NRSV,and he said to him lord you know everything you know that i love you
3964,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him feed my sheep
3965,JHN,21,NRSV,very truly i tell you when you were younger you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished
3966,JHN,21,NRSV,but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go
3967,JHN,21,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify god after this he said to him follow me
3968,JHN,21,NRSV,peter turned and saw the disciple whom jesus loved following them he was the one who had reclined next to jesus at the supper and had said lord who is it that is going to betray you
3969,JHN,21,NRSV,when peter saw him he said to jesus lord what about him
3970,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you
3971,JHN,21,NRSV,follow me so the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die
3972,JHN,21,NRSV,yet jesus did not say to him that he would not die but if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you
3973,JHN,21,NRSV,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true
3974,JHN,21,NRSV,but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written
3975,ACT,1,NRSV,in the first book theophilus i wrote about all that jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the holy spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen
3976,ACT,1,NRSV,after his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of god
3977,ACT,1,NRSV,while staying with them he ordered them not to leave jerusalem but to wait there for the promise of the father
3978,ACT,1,NRSV,this he said is what you have heard from me for john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now
3979,ACT,1,NRSV,so when they had come together they asked him lord is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to israel
3980,ACT,1,NRSV,he replied it is not for you to know the times or periods that the father has set by his own authority
3981,ACT,1,NRSV,but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
3982,ACT,1,NRSV,when he had said this as they were watching he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight
3983,ACT,1,NRSV,while he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven suddenly two men in white robes stood by them
3984,ACT,1,NRSV,they said men of galilee why do you stand looking up toward heaven
3985,ACT,1,NRSV,this jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven
3986,ACT,1,NRSV,then they returned to jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is near jerusalem a sabbath days journey away
3987,ACT,1,NRSV,when they had entered the city they went to the room upstairs where they were staying peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas son of james
3988,ACT,1,NRSV,all these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer together with certain women including mary the mother of jesus as well as his brothers
3989,ACT,1,NRSV,in those days peter stood up among the believers together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons and said friends the scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy spirit through david foretold concerning judas who became a guide for those who arrested jesus for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry
3990,ACT,1,NRSV,now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out
3991,ACT,1,NRSV,this became known to all the residents of jerusalem so that the field was called in their language hakeldama that is field of blood for it is written in the book of psalms let his homestead become desolate and let there be no one to live in it and let another take his position of overseer
3992,ACT,1,NRSV,so one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john until the day when he was taken up from usone of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection
3993,ACT,1,NRSV,so they proposed two joseph called barsabbas who was also known as justus and matthias
3994,ACT,1,NRSV,then they prayed and said lord you know everyones heart
3995,ACT,1,NRSV,show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which judas turned aside to go to his own place
3996,ACT,1,NRSV,and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on matthias and he was added to the eleven apostles
3997,ACT,2,NRSV,when the day of pentecost had come they were all together in one place
3998,ACT,2,NRSV,and suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting
3999,ACT,2,NRSV,divided tongues as of fire appeared among them and a tongue rested on each of them
4000,ACT,2,NRSV,all of them were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other languages as the spirit gave them ability
4001,ACT,2,NRSV,now there were devout jews from every nation under heaven living in jerusalem
4002,ACT,2,NRSV,and at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each
4003,ACT,2,NRSV,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans
4004,ACT,2,NRSV,and how is it that we hear each of us in our own native language
4005,ACT,2,NRSV,parthians medes elamites and residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya belonging to cyrene and visitors from rome both jews and proselytes cretans and arabsin our own languages we hear them speaking about gods deeds of power
4006,ACT,2,NRSV,all were amazed and perplexed saying to one another what does this mean
4007,ACT,2,NRSV,but others sneered and said they are filled with new wine
4008,ACT,2,NRSV,but peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them men of judea and all who live in jerusalem let this be known to you and listen to what i say
4009,ACT,2,NRSV,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning
4010,ACT,2,NRSV,no this is what was spoken through the prophet joel in the last days it will be god declares that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams
4011,ACT,2,NRSV,even upon my slaves both men and women in those days i will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy
4012,ACT,2,NRSV,and i will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below blood and fire and smoky mist
4013,ACT,2,NRSV,the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the lords great and glorious day
4014,ACT,2,NRSV,then everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
4015,ACT,2,NRSV,you that are israelites listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law
4016,ACT,2,NRSV,but god raised him up having freed him from death because it was impossible for him to be held in its power
4017,ACT,2,NRSV,for david says concerning him i saw the lord always before me for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced moreover my flesh will live in hope
4018,ACT,2,NRSV,for you will not abandon my soul to hades or let your holy one experience corruption
4019,ACT,2,NRSV,you have made known to me the ways of life you will make me full of gladness with your presence
4020,ACT,2,NRSV,fellow israelites i may say to you confidently of our ancestor david that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day
4021,ACT,2,NRSV,since he was a prophet he knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne
4022,ACT,2,NRSV,foreseeing this david spoke of the resurrection of the messiah saying he was not abandoned to hades nor did his flesh experience corruption
4023,ACT,2,NRSV,this jesus god raised up and of that all of us are witnesses
4024,ACT,2,NRSV,being therefore exalted at the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured out this that you both see and hear
4025,ACT,2,NRSV,for david did not ascend into the heavens but he himself says the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool
4026,ACT,2,NRSV,therefore let the entire house of israel know with certainty that god has made him both lord and messiah this jesus whom you crucified
4027,ACT,2,NRSV,now when they heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and to the other apostles brothers what should we do
4028,ACT,2,NRSV,peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ so that your sins may be forgiven and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
4029,ACT,2,NRSV,for the promise is for you for your children and for all who are far away everyone whom the lord our god calls to him
4030,ACT,2,NRSV,and he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them saying save yourselves from this corrupt generation
4031,ACT,2,NRSV,so those who welcomed his message were baptized and that day about three thousand persons were added
4032,ACT,2,NRSV,they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers
4033,ACT,2,NRSV,awe came upon everyone because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles
4034,ACT,2,NRSV,all who believed were together and had all things in common they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all as any had need
4035,ACT,2,NRSV,day by day as they spent much time together in the temple they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts praising god and having the goodwill of all the people
4036,ACT,2,NRSV,and day by day the lord added to their number those who were being saved
4037,ACT,3,NRSV,one day peter and john were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer at three oclock in the afternoon
4038,ACT,3,NRSV,and a man lame from birth was being carried in
4039,ACT,3,NRSV,people would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the beautiful gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple
4040,ACT,3,NRSV,when he saw peter and john about to go into the temple he asked them for alms
4041,ACT,3,NRSV,peter looked intently at him as did john and said look at us
4042,ACT,3,NRSV,and he fixed his attention on them expecting to receive something from them
4043,ACT,3,NRSV,but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk
4044,ACT,3,NRSV,and he took him by the right hand and raised him up and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong
4045,ACT,3,NRSV,jumping up he stood and began to walk and he entered the temple with them walking and leaping and praising god
4046,ACT,3,NRSV,all the people saw him walking and praising god and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him
4047,ACT,3,NRSV,while he clung to peter and john all the people ran together to them in the portico called solomons portico utterly astonished
4048,ACT,3,NRSV,when peter saw it he addressed the people you israelites why do you wonder at this or why do you stare at us as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk
4049,ACT,3,NRSV,the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob the god of our ancestors has glorified his servant jesus whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of pilate though he had decided to release him
4050,ACT,3,NRSV,but you rejected the holy and righteous one and asked to have a murderer given to you and you killed the author of life whom god raised from the dead
4051,ACT,3,NRSV,to this we are witnesses
4052,ACT,3,NRSV,and by faith in his name his name itself has made this man strong whom you see and know and the faith that is through jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you
4053,ACT,3,NRSV,and now friends i know that you acted in ignorance as did also your rulers
4054,ACT,3,NRSV,in this way god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets that his messiah would suffer
4055,ACT,3,NRSV,repent therefore and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the lord and that he may send the messiah appointed for you that is jesus who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that god announced long ago through his holy prophets
4056,ACT,3,NRSV,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me
4057,ACT,3,NRSV,you must listen to whatever he tells you
4058,ACT,3,NRSV,and it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people
4059,ACT,3,NRSV,and all the prophets as many as have spoken from samuel and those after him also predicted these days
4060,ACT,3,NRSV,you are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that god gave to your ancestors saying to abraham and in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed
4061,ACT,3,NRSV,when god raised up his servant he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways
4062,ACT,4,NRSV,while peter and john were speaking to the people the priests the captain of the temple and the sadducees came to them much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in jesus there is the resurrection of the dead
4063,ACT,4,NRSV,so they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening
4064,ACT,4,NRSV,but many of those who heard the word believed and they numbered about five thousand
4065,ACT,4,NRSV,the next day their rulers elders and scribes assembled in jerusalem with annas the high priest caiaphas john and alexander and all who were of the highpriestly family
4066,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had made the prisoners stand in their midst they inquired by what power or by what name did you do this
4067,ACT,4,NRSV,then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them rulers of the people and elders if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed let it be known to all of you and to all the people of israel that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead
4068,ACT,4,NRSV,this jesus is the stone that was rejected by you the builders it has become the cornerstone
4069,ACT,4,NRSV,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved
4070,ACT,4,NRSV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were amazed and recognized them as companions of jesus
4071,ACT,4,NRSV,when they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition
4072,ACT,4,NRSV,so they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another
4073,ACT,4,NRSV,they said what will we do with them
4074,ACT,4,NRSV,for it is obvious to all who live in jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them we cannot deny it
4075,ACT,4,NRSV,but to keep it from spreading further among the people let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name
4076,ACT,4,NRSV,so they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus
4077,ACT,4,NRSV,but peter and john answered them whether it is right in gods sight to listen to you rather than to god you must judge for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard
4078,ACT,4,NRSV,after threatening them again they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for all of them praised god for what had happened
4079,ACT,4,NRSV,for the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old
4080,ACT,4,NRSV,after they were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them
4081,ACT,4,NRSV,when they heard it they raised their voices together to god and said sovereign lord who made the heaven and the earth the sea and everything in them it is you who said by the holy spirit through our ancestor david your servant why did the gentiles rage and the peoples imagine vain things
4082,ACT,4,NRSV,the kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers have gathered together against the lord and against his messiah
4083,ACT,4,NRSV,for in this city in fact both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the peoples of israel gathered together against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place
4084,ACT,4,NRSV,and now lord look at their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant jesus
4085,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god with boldness
4086,ACT,4,NRSV,now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions but everything they owned was held in common
4087,ACT,4,NRSV,with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
4088,ACT,4,NRSV,there was not a needy person among them for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold
4089,ACT,4,NRSV,they laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need
4090,ACT,4,NRSV,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement
4091,ACT,4,NRSV,he sold a field that belonged to him then brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
4092,ACT,5,NRSV,but a man named ananias with the consent of his wife sapphira sold a piece of property with his wifes knowledge he kept back some of the proceeds and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet
4093,ACT,5,NRSV,ananias peter asked why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land
4094,ACT,5,NRSV,while it remained unsold did it not remain your own
4095,ACT,5,NRSV,and after it was sold were not the proceeds at your disposal
4096,ACT,5,NRSV,how is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart
4097,ACT,5,NRSV,you did not lie to us but to god now when ananias heard these words he fell down and died
4098,ACT,5,NRSV,and great fear seized all who heard of it
4099,ACT,5,NRSV,the young men came and wrapped up his body then carried him out and buried him
4100,ACT,5,NRSV,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened
4101,ACT,5,NRSV,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price
4102,ACT,5,NRSV,and she said yes that was the price
4103,ACT,5,NRSV,then peter said to her how is it that you have agreed together to put the spirit of the lord to the test
4104,ACT,5,NRSV,look the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out
4105,ACT,5,NRSV,immediately she fell down at his feet and died
4106,ACT,5,NRSV,when the young men came in they found her dead so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband
4107,ACT,5,NRSV,and great fear seized the whole church and all who heard of these things
4108,ACT,5,NRSV,now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles
4109,ACT,5,NRSV,and they were all together in solomons portico
4110,ACT,5,NRSV,none of the rest dared to join them but the people held them in high esteem
4111,ACT,5,NRSV,yet more than ever believers were added to the lord great numbers of both men and women so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats in order that peters shadow might fall on some of them as he came by
4112,ACT,5,NRSV,a great number of people would also gather from the towns around jerusalem bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits and they were all cured
4113,ACT,5,NRSV,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison
4114,ACT,5,NRSV,but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison doors brought them out and said go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life
4115,ACT,5,NRSV,when they heard this they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching
4116,ACT,5,NRSV,when the high priest and those with him arrived they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
4117,ACT,5,NRSV,but when the temple police went there they did not find them in the prison so they returned and reported we found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside
4118,ACT,5,NRSV,now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were perplexed about them wondering what might be going on
4119,ACT,5,NRSV,then someone arrived and announced look the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people then the captain went with the temple police and brought them but without violence for they were afraid of being stoned by the people
4120,ACT,5,NRSV,when they had brought them they had them stand before the council
4121,ACT,5,NRSV,the high priest questioned them saying we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name yet here you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this mans blood on us
4122,ACT,5,NRSV,but peter and the apostles answered we must obey god rather than any human authority
4123,ACT,5,NRSV,the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree
4124,ACT,5,NRSV,god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
4125,ACT,5,NRSV,and we are witnesses to these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
4126,ACT,5,NRSV,when they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them
4127,ACT,5,NRSV,but a pharisee in the council named gamaliel a teacher of the law respected by all the people stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time
4128,ACT,5,NRSV,then he said to them fellow israelites consider carefully what you propose to do to these men
4129,ACT,5,NRSV,for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him but he was killed and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared
4130,ACT,5,NRSV,after him judas the galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him he also perished and all who followed him were scattered
4131,ACT,5,NRSV,so in the present case i tell you keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow themin that case you may even be found fighting against god they were convinced by him and when they had called in the apostles they had them flogged
4132,ACT,5,NRSV,then they ordered them not to speak in the name of jesus and let them go
4133,ACT,5,NRSV,as they left the council they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name
4134,ACT,5,NRSV,and every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim jesus as the messiah
4135,ACT,6,NRSV,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food
4136,ACT,6,NRSV,and the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said it is not right that we should neglect the word of god in order to wait on tables
4137,ACT,6,NRSV,therefore friends select from among yourselves seven men of good standing full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint to this task while we for our part will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word
4138,ACT,6,NRSV,what they said pleased the whole community and they chose stephen a man full of faith and the holy spirit together with philip prochorus nicanor timon parmenas and nicolaus a proselyte of antioch
4139,ACT,6,NRSV,they had these men stand before the apostles who prayed and laid their hands on them
4140,ACT,6,NRSV,the word of god continued to spread the number of the disciples increased greatly in jerusalem and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith
4141,ACT,6,NRSV,stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people
4142,ACT,6,NRSV,then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called cyrenians alexandrians and others of those from cilicia and asia stood up and argued with stephen
4143,ACT,6,NRSV,but they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke
4144,ACT,6,NRSV,then they secretly instigated some men to say we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god
4145,ACT,6,NRSV,they stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes then they suddenly confronted him seized him and brought him before the council
4146,ACT,6,NRSV,they set up false witnesses who said this man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that moses handed on to us
4147,ACT,6,NRSV,and all who sat in the council looked intently at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel
4148,ACT,7,NRSV,then the high priest asked him are these things so
4149,ACT,7,NRSV,and stephen replied brothers and fathers listen to me
4150,ACT,7,NRSV,the god of glory appeared to our ancestor abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he lived in haran and said to him leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that i will show you
4151,ACT,7,NRSV,then he left the country of the chaldeans and settled in haran
4152,ACT,7,NRSV,after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living
4153,ACT,7,NRSV,he did not give him any of it as a heritage not even a foots length but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him even though he had no child
4154,ACT,7,NRSV,and god spoke in these terms that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years
4155,ACT,7,NRSV,but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place
4156,ACT,7,NRSV,then he gave him the covenant of circumcision
4157,ACT,7,NRSV,and so abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day and isaac became the father of jacob and jacob of the twelve patriarchs
4158,ACT,7,NRSV,the patriarchs jealous of joseph sold him into egypt but god was with him and rescued him from all his afflictions and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt who appointed him ruler over egypt and over all his household
4159,ACT,7,NRSV,now there came a famine throughout egypt and canaan and great suffering and our ancestors could find no food
4160,ACT,7,NRSV,but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent our ancestors there on their first visit
4161,ACT,7,NRSV,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh
4162,ACT,7,NRSV,then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventyfive in all so jacob went down to egypt
4163,ACT,7,NRSV,he himself died there as well as our ancestors and their bodies were brought back to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem
4164,ACT,7,NRSV,but as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that god had made to abraham our people in egypt increased and multiplied until another king who had not known joseph ruled over egypt
4165,ACT,7,NRSV,he dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die
4166,ACT,7,NRSV,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god
4167,ACT,7,NRSV,for three months he was brought up in his fathers house and when he was abandoned pharaohs daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son
4168,ACT,7,NRSV,so moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds
4169,ACT,7,NRSV,when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his relatives the israelites
4170,ACT,7,NRSV,when he saw one of them being wronged he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the egyptian
4171,ACT,7,NRSV,he supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that god through him was rescuing them but they did not understand
4172,ACT,7,NRSV,the next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them saying men you are brothers why do you wrong each other
4173,ACT,7,NRSV,but the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed moses aside saying who made you a ruler and a judge over us
4174,ACT,7,NRSV,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday
4175,ACT,7,NRSV,when he heard this moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of midian
4176,ACT,7,NRSV,there he became the father of two sons
4177,ACT,7,NRSV,now when forty years had passed an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in the flame of a burning bush
4178,ACT,7,NRSV,when moses saw it he was amazed at the sight and as he approached to look there came the voice of the lord i am the god of your ancestors the god of abraham isaac and jacob
4179,ACT,7,NRSV,moses began to tremble and did not dare to look
4180,ACT,7,NRSV,then the lord said to him take off the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground
4181,ACT,7,NRSV,i have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in egypt and have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them
4182,ACT,7,NRSV,come now i will send you to egypt
4183,ACT,7,NRSV,it was this moses whom they rejected when they said who made you a ruler and a judge
4184,ACT,7,NRSV,and whom god now sent as both ruler and liberator through the angel who appeared to him in the bush
4185,ACT,7,NRSV,he led them out having performed wonders and signs in egypt at the red sea and in the wilderness for forty years
4186,ACT,7,NRSV,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up
4187,ACT,7,NRSV,he is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at mount sinai and with our ancestors and he received living oracles to give to us
4188,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors were unwilling to obey him instead they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to egypt saying to aaron make gods for us who will lead the way for us as for this moses who led us out from the land of egypt we do not know what has happened to him
4189,ACT,7,NRSV,at that time they made a calf offered a sacrifice to the idol and reveled in the works of their hands
4190,ACT,7,NRSV,but god turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness o house of israel
4191,ACT,7,NRSV,no you took along the tent of moloch and the star of your god rephan the images that you made to worship so i will remove you beyond babylon
4192,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen
4193,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors in turn brought it in with joshua when they dispossessed the nations that god drove out before our ancestors
4194,ACT,7,NRSV,and it was there until the time of david who found favor with god and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of jacob
4195,ACT,7,NRSV,but it was solomon who built a house for him
4196,ACT,7,NRSV,yet the most high does not dwell in houses made with human hands as the prophet says heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool
4197,ACT,7,NRSV,what kind of house will you build for me says the lord or what is the place of my rest
4198,ACT,7,NRSV,did not my hand make all these things
4199,ACT,7,NRSV,you stiffnecked people uncircumcised in heart and ears you are forever opposing the holy spirit just as your ancestors used to do
4200,ACT,7,NRSV,which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute
4201,ACT,7,NRSV,they killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one and now you have become his betrayers and murderers
4202,ACT,7,NRSV,you are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels and yet you have not kept it
4203,ACT,7,NRSV,when they heard these things they became enraged and ground their teeth at stephen
4204,ACT,7,NRSV,but filled with the holy spirit he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god
4205,ACT,7,NRSV,look he said i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god but they covered their ears and with a loud shout all rushed together against him
4206,ACT,7,NRSV,then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named saul
4207,ACT,7,NRSV,while they were stoning stephen he prayed lord jesus receive my spirit
4208,ACT,7,NRSV,then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them
4209,ACT,7,NRSV,when he had said this he died
4210,ACT,8,NRSV,and saul approved of their killing him
4211,ACT,8,NRSV,that day a severe persecution began against the church in jerusalem and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of judea and samaria
4212,ACT,8,NRSV,devout men buried stephen and made loud lamentation over him
4213,ACT,8,NRSV,but saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house dragging off both men and women he committed them to prison
4214,ACT,8,NRSV,now those who were scattered went from place to place proclaiming the word
4215,ACT,8,NRSV,philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed the messiah to them
4216,ACT,8,NRSV,the crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by philip hearing and seeing the signs that he did for unclean spirits crying with loud shrieks came out of many who were possessed and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured
4217,ACT,8,NRSV,so there was great joy in that city
4218,ACT,8,NRSV,now a certain man named simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of samaria saying that he was someone great
4219,ACT,8,NRSV,all of them from the least to the greatest listened to him eagerly saying this man is the power of god that is called great
4220,ACT,8,NRSV,and they listened eagerly to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic
4221,ACT,8,NRSV,but when they believed philip who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
4222,ACT,8,NRSV,even simon himself believed
4223,ACT,8,NRSV,after being baptized he stayed constantly with philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place
4224,ACT,8,NRSV,now when the apostles at jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them
4225,ACT,8,NRSV,the two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit for as yet the spirit had not come upon any of them they had only been baptized in the name of the lord jesus
4226,ACT,8,NRSV,then peter and john laid their hands on them and they received the holy spirit
4227,ACT,8,NRSV,now when simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money saying give me also this power so that anyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit
4228,ACT,8,NRSV,but peter said to him may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain gods gift with money you have no part or share in this for your heart is not right before god
4229,ACT,8,NRSV,repent therefore of this wickedness of yours and pray to the lord that if possible the intent of your heart may be forgiven you
4230,ACT,8,NRSV,for i see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness
4231,ACT,8,NRSV,simon answered pray for me to the lord that nothing of what you have said may happen to me
4232,ACT,8,NRSV,now after peter and john had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans
4233,ACT,8,NRSV,then an angel of the lord said to philip get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza
4234,ACT,8,NRSV,this is a wilderness road so he got up and went
4235,ACT,8,NRSV,now there was an ethiopian eunuch a court official of the candace queen of the ethiopians in charge of her entire treasury
4236,ACT,8,NRSV,he had come to jerusalem to worship and was returning home seated in his chariot he was reading the prophet isaiah
4237,ACT,8,NRSV,then the spirit said to philip go over to this chariot and join it
4238,ACT,8,NRSV,so philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet isaiah
4239,ACT,8,NRSV,he asked do you understand what you are reading
4240,ACT,8,NRSV,he replied how can i unless someone guides me
4241,ACT,8,NRSV,and he invited philip to get in and sit beside him
4242,ACT,8,NRSV,now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb silent before its shearer so he does not open his mouth
4243,ACT,8,NRSV,in his humiliation justice was denied him
4244,ACT,8,NRSV,who can describe his generation
4245,ACT,8,NRSV,for his life is taken away from the earth
4246,ACT,8,NRSV,the eunuch asked philip about whom may i ask you does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else
4247,ACT,8,NRSV,then philip began to speak and starting with this scripture he proclaimed to him the good news about jesus
4248,ACT,8,NRSV,as they were going along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said look here is water what is to prevent me from being baptized
4249,ACT,8,NRSV,he commanded the chariot to stop and both of them philip and the eunuch went down into the water and philip baptized him
4250,ACT,8,NRSV,when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord snatched philip away the eunuch saw him no more and went on his way rejoicing
4251,ACT,8,NRSV,but philip found himself at azotus and as he was passing through the region he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to caesarea
4252,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the lord went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at damascus so that if he found any who belonged to the way men or women he might bring them bound to jerusalem
4253,ACT,9,NRSV,now as he was going along and approaching damascus suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
4254,ACT,9,NRSV,he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why do you persecute me
4255,ACT,9,NRSV,he asked who are you lord
4256,ACT,9,NRSV,the reply came i am jesus whom you are persecuting
4257,ACT,9,NRSV,but get up and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do
4258,ACT,9,NRSV,the men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one
4259,ACT,9,NRSV,saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus
4260,ACT,9,NRSV,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank
4261,ACT,9,NRSV,now there was a disciple in damascus named ananias
4262,ACT,9,NRSV,the lord said to him in a vision ananias
4263,ACT,9,NRSV,he answered here i am lord
4264,ACT,9,NRSV,the lord said to him get up and go to the street called straight and at the house of judas look for a man of tarsus named saul
4265,ACT,9,NRSV,at this moment he is praying and he has seen in a vision a man named ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight
4266,ACT,9,NRSV,but ananias answered lord i have heard from many about this man how much evil he has done to your saints in jerusalem and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name
4267,ACT,9,NRSV,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name
4268,ACT,9,NRSV,so ananias went and entered the house
4269,ACT,9,NRSV,he laid his hands on saul and said brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on your way here has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the holy spirit
4270,ACT,9,NRSV,and immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and his sight was restored
4271,ACT,9,NRSV,then he got up and was baptized and after taking some food he regained his strength
4272,ACT,9,NRSV,for several days he was with the disciples in damascus and immediately he began to proclaim jesus in the synagogues saying he is the son of god
4273,ACT,9,NRSV,all who heard him were amazed and said is not this the man who made havoc in jerusalem among those who invoked this name
4274,ACT,9,NRSV,and has he not come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests
4275,ACT,9,NRSV,saul became increasingly more powerful and confounded the jews who lived in damascus by proving that jesus was the messiah
4276,ACT,9,NRSV,after some time had passed the jews plotted to kill him but their plot became known to saul
4277,ACT,9,NRSV,they were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall lowering him in a basket
4278,ACT,9,NRSV,when he had come to jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples and they were all afraid of him for they did not believe that he was a disciple
4279,ACT,9,NRSV,but barnabas took him brought him to the apostles and described for them how on the road he had seen the lord who had spoken to him and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of jesus
4280,ACT,9,NRSV,so he went in and out among them in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord
4281,ACT,9,NRSV,he spoke and argued with the hellenists but they were attempting to kill him
4282,ACT,9,NRSV,when the believers learned of it they brought him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus
4283,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile the church throughout judea galilee and samaria had peace and was built up
4284,ACT,9,NRSV,living in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit it increased in numbers
4285,ACT,9,NRSV,now as peter went here and there among all the believers he came down also to the saints living in lydda
4286,ACT,9,NRSV,there he found a man named aeneas who had been bedridden for eight years for he was paralyzed
4287,ACT,9,NRSV,peter said to him aeneas jesus christ heals you get up and make your bed and immediately he got up
4288,ACT,9,NRSV,and all the residents of lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord
4289,ACT,9,NRSV,now in joppa there was a disciple whose name was tabitha which in greek is dorcas
4290,ACT,9,NRSV,she was devoted to good works and acts of charity
4291,ACT,9,NRSV,at that time she became ill and died
4292,ACT,9,NRSV,when they had washed her they laid her in a room upstairs
4293,ACT,9,NRSV,since lydda was near joppa the disciples who heard that peter was there sent two men to him with the request please come to us without delay
4294,ACT,9,NRSV,so peter got up and went with them and when he arrived they took him to the room upstairs
4295,ACT,9,NRSV,all the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that dorcas had made while she was with them
4296,ACT,9,NRSV,peter put all of them outside and then he knelt down and prayed
4297,ACT,9,NRSV,he turned to the body and said tabitha get up
4298,ACT,9,NRSV,then she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up
4299,ACT,9,NRSV,he gave her his hand and helped her up
4300,ACT,9,NRSV,then calling the saints and widows he showed her to be alive
4301,ACT,9,NRSV,this became known throughout joppa and many believed in the lord
4302,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile he stayed in joppa for some time with a certain simon a tanner
4303,ACT,10,NRSV,in caesarea there was a man named cornelius a centurion of the italian cohort as it was called
4304,ACT,10,NRSV,he was a devout man who feared god with all his household he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to god
4305,ACT,10,NRSV,one afternoon at about three oclock he had a vision in which he clearly saw an angel of god coming in and saying to him cornelius
4306,ACT,10,NRSV,he stared at him in terror and said what is it lord
4307,ACT,10,NRSV,he answered your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before god
4308,ACT,10,NRSV,now send men to joppa for a certain simon who is called peter he is lodging with simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside
4309,ACT,10,NRSV,when the angel who spoke to him had left he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him and after telling them everything he sent them to joppa
4310,ACT,10,NRSV,about noon the next day as they were on their journey and approaching the city peter went up on the roof to pray
4311,ACT,10,NRSV,he became hungry and wanted something to eat and while it was being prepared he fell into a trance
4312,ACT,10,NRSV,he saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down being lowered to the ground by its four corners
4313,ACT,10,NRSV,in it were all kinds of fourfooted creatures and reptiles and birds of the air
4314,ACT,10,NRSV,then he heard a voice saying get up peter kill and eat
4315,ACT,10,NRSV,but peter said by no means lord for i have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean
4316,ACT,10,NRSV,the voice said to him again a second time what god has made clean you must not call profane
4317,ACT,10,NRSV,this happened three times and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven
4318,ACT,10,NRSV,now while peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen suddenly the men sent by cornelius appeared
4319,ACT,10,NRSV,they were asking for simons house and were standing by the gate
4320,ACT,10,NRSV,they called out to ask whether simon who was called peter was staying there
4321,ACT,10,NRSV,while peter was still thinking about the vision the spirit said to him look three men are searching for you
4322,ACT,10,NRSV,now get up go down and go with them without hesitation for i have sent them
4323,ACT,10,NRSV,so peter went down to the men and said i am the one you are looking for what is the reason for your coming
4324,ACT,10,NRSV,they answered cornelius a centurion an upright and godfearing man who is well spoken of by the whole jewish nation was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say
4325,ACT,10,NRSV,so peter invited them in and gave them lodging
4326,ACT,10,NRSV,the next day he got up and went with them and some of the believers from joppa accompanied him
4327,ACT,10,NRSV,the following day they came to caesarea
4328,ACT,10,NRSV,cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends
4329,ACT,10,NRSV,on peters arrival cornelius met him and falling at his feet worshiped him
4330,ACT,10,NRSV,but peter made him get up saying stand up i am only a mortal
4331,ACT,10,NRSV,and as he talked with him he went in and found that many had assembled and he said to them you yourselves know that it is unlawful for a jew to associate with or to visit a gentile but god has shown me that i should not call anyone profane or unclean
4332,ACT,10,NRSV,so when i was sent for i came without objection
4333,ACT,10,NRSV,now may i ask why you sent for me
4334,ACT,10,NRSV,cornelius replied four days ago at this very hour at three oclock i was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me
4335,ACT,10,NRSV,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god
4336,ACT,10,NRSV,send therefore to joppa and ask for simon who is called peter he is staying in the home of simon a tanner by the sea
4337,ACT,10,NRSV,therefore i sent for you immediately and you have been kind enough to come
4338,ACT,10,NRSV,so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say
4339,ACT,10,NRSV,then peter began to speak to them i truly understand that god shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him
4340,ACT,10,NRSV,you know the message he sent to the people of israel preaching peace by jesus christhe is lord of all
4341,ACT,10,NRSV,that message spread throughout judea beginning in galilee after the baptism that john announced how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for god was with him
4342,ACT,10,NRSV,we are witnesses to all that he did both in judea and in jerusalem
4343,ACT,10,NRSV,they put him to death by hanging him on a tree but god raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear not to all the people but to us who were chosen by god as witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead
4344,ACT,10,NRSV,he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by god as judge of the living and the dead
4345,ACT,10,NRSV,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name
4346,ACT,10,NRSV,while peter was still speaking the holy spirit fell upon all who heard the word
4347,ACT,10,NRSV,the circumcised believers who had come with peter were astounded that the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on the gentiles for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling god
4348,ACT,10,NRSV,then peter said can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the holy spirit just as we have
4349,ACT,10,NRSV,so he ordered them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ
4350,ACT,10,NRSV,then they invited him to stay for several days
4351,ACT,11,NRSV,now the apostles and the believers who were in judea heard that the gentiles had also accepted the word of god
4352,ACT,11,NRSV,so when peter went up to jerusalem the circumcised believers criticized him saying why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them
4353,ACT,11,NRSV,then peter began to explain it to them step by step saying i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision
4354,ACT,11,NRSV,there was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven being lowered by its four corners and it came close to me
4355,ACT,11,NRSV,as i looked at it closely i saw fourfooted animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air
4356,ACT,11,NRSV,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat
4357,ACT,11,NRSV,but i replied by no means lord for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth
4358,ACT,11,NRSV,but a second time the voice answered from heaven what god has made clean you must not call profane
4359,ACT,11,NRSV,this happened three times then everything was pulled up again to heaven
4360,ACT,11,NRSV,at that very moment three men sent to me from caesarea arrived at the house where we were
4361,ACT,11,NRSV,the spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us
4362,ACT,11,NRSV,these six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the mans house
4363,ACT,11,NRSV,he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and bring simon who is called peter he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved
4364,ACT,11,NRSV,and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning
4365,ACT,11,NRSV,and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit
4366,ACT,11,NRSV,if then god gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i could hinder god
4367,ACT,11,NRSV,when they heard this they were silenced
4368,ACT,11,NRSV,and they praised god saying then god has given even to the gentiles the repentance that leads to life
4369,ACT,11,NRSV,now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over stephen traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch and they spoke the word to no one except jews
4370,ACT,11,NRSV,but among them were some men of cyprus and cyrene who on coming to antioch spoke to the hellenists also proclaiming the lord jesus
4371,ACT,11,NRSV,the hand of the lord was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord
4372,ACT,11,NRSV,news of this came to the ears of the church in jerusalem and they sent barnabas to antioch
4373,ACT,11,NRSV,when he came and saw the grace of god he rejoiced and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the lord with steadfast devotion for he was a good man full of the holy spirit and of faith
4374,ACT,11,NRSV,and a great many people were brought to the lord
4375,ACT,11,NRSV,then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he had found him he brought him to antioch
4376,ACT,11,NRSV,so it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people and it was in antioch that the disciples were first called christians
4377,ACT,11,NRSV,at that time prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch
4378,ACT,11,NRSV,one of them named agabus stood up and predicted by the spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world and this took place during the reign of claudius
4379,ACT,11,NRSV,the disciples determined that according to their ability each would send relief to the believers living in judea this they did sending it to the elders by barnabas and saul
4380,ACT,12,NRSV,about that time king herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church
4381,ACT,12,NRSV,he had james the brother of john killed with the sword
4382,ACT,12,NRSV,after he saw that it pleased the jews he proceeded to arrest peter also
4383,ACT,12,NRSV,this was during the festival of unleavened bread when he had seized him he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him intending to bring him out to the people after the passover
4384,ACT,12,NRSV,while peter was kept in prison the church prayed fervently to god for him
4385,ACT,12,NRSV,the very night before herod was going to bring him out peter bound with two chains was sleeping between two soldiers while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison
4386,ACT,12,NRSV,suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell
4387,ACT,12,NRSV,he tapped peter on the side and woke him saying get up quickly
4388,ACT,12,NRSV,and the chains fell off his wrists
4389,ACT,12,NRSV,the angel said to him fasten your belt and put on your sandals
4390,ACT,12,NRSV,he did so
4391,ACT,12,NRSV,then he said to him wrap your cloak around you and follow me
4392,ACT,12,NRSV,peter went out and followed him he did not realize that what was happening with the angels help was real he thought he was seeing a vision
4393,ACT,12,NRSV,after they had passed the first and the second guard they came before the iron gate leading into the city
4394,ACT,12,NRSV,it opened for them of its own accord and they went outside and walked along a lane when suddenly the angel left him
4395,ACT,12,NRSV,then peter came to himself and said now i am sure that the lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of herod and from all that the jewish people were expecting
4396,ACT,12,NRSV,as soon as he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john whose other name was mark where many had gathered and were praying
4397,ACT,12,NRSV,when he knocked at the outer gate a maid named rhoda came to answer
4398,ACT,12,NRSV,on recognizing peters voice she was so overjoyed that instead of opening the gate she ran in and announced that peter was standing at the gate
4399,ACT,12,NRSV,they said to her you are out of your mind but she insisted that it was so
4400,ACT,12,NRSV,they said it is his angel
4401,ACT,12,NRSV,meanwhile peter continued knocking and when they opened the gate they saw him and were amazed
4402,ACT,12,NRSV,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison
4403,ACT,12,NRSV,and he added tell this to james and to the believers
4404,ACT,12,NRSV,then he left and went to another place
4405,ACT,12,NRSV,when morning came there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of peter
4406,ACT,12,NRSV,when herod had searched for him and could not find him he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death
4407,ACT,12,NRSV,then he went down from judea to caesarea and stayed there
4408,ACT,12,NRSV,now herod was angry with the people of tyre and sidon
4409,ACT,12,NRSV,so they came to him in a body and after winning over blastus the kings chamberlain they asked for a reconciliation because their country depended on the kings country for food
4410,ACT,12,NRSV,on an appointed day herod put on his royal robes took his seat on the platform and delivered a public address to them
4411,ACT,12,NRSV,the people kept shouting the voice of a god and not of a mortal and immediately because he had not given the glory to god an angel of the lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died
4412,ACT,12,NRSV,but the word of god continued to advance and gain adherents
4413,ACT,12,NRSV,then after completing their mission barnabas and saul returned to jerusalem and brought with them john whose other name was mark
4414,ACT,13,NRSV,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler and saul
4415,ACT,13,NRSV,while they were worshiping the lord and fasting the holy spirit said set apart for me barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them
4416,ACT,13,NRSV,then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off
4417,ACT,13,NRSV,so being sent out by the holy spirit they went down to seleucia and from there they sailed to cyprus
4418,ACT,13,NRSV,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews
4419,ACT,13,NRSV,and they had john also to assist them
4420,ACT,13,NRSV,when they had gone through the whole island as far as paphos they met a certain magician a jewish false prophet named barjesus
4421,ACT,13,NRSV,he was with the proconsul sergius paulus an intelligent man who summoned barnabas and saul and wanted to hear the word of god
4422,ACT,13,NRSV,but the magician elymas for that is the translation of his name opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith
4423,ACT,13,NRSV,but saul also known as paul filled with the holy spirit looked intently at him and said you son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness full of all deceit and villainy will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the lord
4424,ACT,13,NRSV,and now listenthe hand of the lord is against you and you will be blind for a while unable to see the sun
4425,ACT,13,NRSV,immediately mist and darkness came over him and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand
4426,ACT,13,NRSV,when the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was astonished at the teaching about the lord
4427,ACT,13,NRSV,then paul and his companions set sail from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia
4428,ACT,13,NRSV,john however left them and returned to jerusalem but they went on from perga and came to antioch in pisidia
4429,ACT,13,NRSV,and on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down
4430,ACT,13,NRSV,after the reading of the law and the prophets the officials of the synagogue sent them a message saying brothers if you have any word of exhortation for the people give it
4431,ACT,13,NRSV,so paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak you israelites and others who fear god listen
4432,ACT,13,NRSV,the god of this people israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of egypt and with uplifted arm he led them out of it
4433,ACT,13,NRSV,for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness
4434,ACT,13,NRSV,after he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years
4435,ACT,13,NRSV,after that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet samuel
4436,ACT,13,NRSV,then they asked for a king and god gave them saul son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin who reigned for forty years
4437,ACT,13,NRSV,when he had removed him he made david their king
4438,ACT,13,NRSV,in his testimony about him he said i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who will carry out all my wishes
4439,ACT,13,NRSV,of this mans posterity god has brought to israel a savior jesus as he promised before his coming john had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
4440,ACT,13,NRSV,and as john was finishing his work he said what do you suppose that i am
4441,ACT,13,NRSV,i am not he
4442,ACT,13,NRSV,no but one is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet
4443,ACT,13,NRSV,my brothers you descendants of abrahams family and others who fear god to us the message of this salvation has been sent
4444,ACT,13,NRSV,because the residents of jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath they fulfilled those words by condemning him
4445,ACT,13,NRSV,even though they found no cause for a sentence of death they asked pilate to have him killed
4446,ACT,13,NRSV,when they had carried out everything that was written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb
4447,ACT,13,NRSV,but god raised him from the dead and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from galilee to jerusalem and they are now his witnesses to the people
4448,ACT,13,NRSV,and we bring you the good news that what god promised to our ancestors he has fulfilled for us their children by raising jesus as also it is written in the second psalm you are my son today i have begotten you
4449,ACT,13,NRSV,as to his raising him from the dead no more to return to corruption he has spoken in this way i will give you the holy promises made to david
4450,ACT,13,NRSV,therefore he has also said in another psalm you will not let your holy one experience corruption
4451,ACT,13,NRSV,for david after he had served the purpose of god in his own generation died was laid beside his ancestors and experienced corruption but he whom god raised up experienced no corruption
4452,ACT,13,NRSV,let it be known to you therefore my brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you by this jesus everyone who believes is set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the law of moses
4453,ACT,13,NRSV,beware therefore that what the prophets said does not happen to you look you scoffers be amazed and perish for in your days i am doing a work a work that you will never believe even if someone tells you
4454,ACT,13,NRSV,as paul and barnabas were going out the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath
4455,ACT,13,NRSV,when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god
4456,ACT,13,NRSV,the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord
4457,ACT,13,NRSV,but when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy and blaspheming they contradicted what was spoken by paul
4458,ACT,13,NRSV,then both paul and barnabas spoke out boldly saying it was necessary that the word of god should be spoken first to you
4459,ACT,13,NRSV,since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life we are now turning to the gentiles
4460,ACT,13,NRSV,for so the lord has commanded us saying i have set you to be a light for the gentiles so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth
4461,ACT,13,NRSV,when the gentiles heard this they were glad and praised the word of the lord and as many as had been destined for eternal life became believers
4462,ACT,13,NRSV,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region
4463,ACT,13,NRSV,but the jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city and stirred up persecution against paul and barnabas and drove them out of their region
4464,ACT,13,NRSV,so they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to iconium
4465,ACT,13,NRSV,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit
4466,ACT,14,NRSV,the same thing occurred in iconium where paul and barnabas went into the jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both jews and greeks became believers
4467,ACT,14,NRSV,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers
4468,ACT,14,NRSV,so they remained for a long time speaking boldly for the lord who testified to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through them
4469,ACT,14,NRSV,but the residents of the city were divided some sided with the jews and some with the apostles
4470,ACT,14,NRSV,and when an attempt was made by both gentiles and jews with their rulers to mistreat them and to stone them the apostles learned of it and fled to lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and to the surrounding country and there they continued proclaiming the good news
4471,ACT,14,NRSV,in lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet and had never walked for he had been crippled from birth
4472,ACT,14,NRSV,he listened to paul as he was speaking
4473,ACT,14,NRSV,and paul looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed said in a loud voice stand upright on your feet
4474,ACT,14,NRSV,and the man sprang up and began to walk
4475,ACT,14,NRSV,when the crowds saw what paul had done they shouted in the lycaonian language the gods have come down to us in human form barnabas they called zeus and paul they called hermes because he was the chief speaker
4476,ACT,14,NRSV,the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice
4477,ACT,14,NRSV,when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of it they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd shouting friends why are you doing this
4478,ACT,14,NRSV,we are mortals just like you and we bring you good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them
4479,ACT,14,NRSV,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy
4480,ACT,14,NRSV,even with these words they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them
4481,ACT,14,NRSV,but jews came there from antioch and iconium and won over the crowds
4482,ACT,14,NRSV,then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead
4483,ACT,14,NRSV,but when the disciples surrounded him he got up and went into the city
4484,ACT,14,NRSV,the next day he went on with barnabas to derbe
4485,ACT,14,NRSV,after they had proclaimed the good news to that city and had made many disciples they returned to lystra then on to iconium and antioch
4486,ACT,14,NRSV,there they strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith saying it is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of god
4487,ACT,14,NRSV,and after they had appointed elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had come to believe
4488,ACT,14,NRSV,then they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia
4489,ACT,14,NRSV,when they had spoken the word in perga they went down to attalia
4490,ACT,14,NRSV,from there they sailed back to antioch where they had been commended to the grace of god for the work that they had completed
4491,ACT,14,NRSV,when they arrived they called the church together and related all that god had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles
4492,ACT,14,NRSV,and they stayed there with the disciples for some time
4493,ACT,15,NRSV,then certain individuals came down from judea and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved
4494,ACT,15,NRSV,and after paul and barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them paul and barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders
4495,ACT,15,NRSV,so they were sent on their way by the church and as they passed through both phoenicia and samaria they reported the conversion of the gentiles and brought great joy to all the believers
4496,ACT,15,NRSV,when they came to jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they reported all that god had done with them
4497,ACT,15,NRSV,but some believers who belonged to the sect of the pharisees stood up and said it is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of moses
4498,ACT,15,NRSV,the apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter
4499,ACT,15,NRSV,after there had been much debate peter stood up and said to them my brothers you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that i should be the one through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers
4500,ACT,15,NRSV,and god who knows the human heart testified to them by giving them the holy spirit just as he did to us and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us
4501,ACT,15,NRSV,now therefore why are you putting god to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear
4502,ACT,15,NRSV,on the contrary we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the lord jesus just as they will
4503,ACT,15,NRSV,the whole assembly kept silence and listened to barnabas and paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that god had done through them among the gentiles
4504,ACT,15,NRSV,after they finished speaking james replied my brothers listen to me
4505,ACT,15,NRSV,simeon has related how god first looked favorably on the gentiles to take from among them a people for his name
4506,ACT,15,NRSV,this agrees with the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and i will rebuild the dwelling of david which has fallen from its ruins i will rebuild it and i will set it up so that all other peoples may seek the lord even all the gentiles over whom my name has been called
4507,ACT,15,NRSV,thus says the lord who has been making these things known from long ago
4508,ACT,15,NRSV,therefore i have reached the decision that we should not trouble those gentiles who are turning to god but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood
4509,ACT,15,NRSV,for in every city for generations past moses has had those who proclaim him for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues
4510,ACT,15,NRSV,then the apostles and the elders with the consent of the whole church decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to antioch with paul and barnabas
4511,ACT,15,NRSV,they sent judas called barsabbas and silas leaders among the brothers with the following letter the brothers both the apostles and the elders to the believers of gentile origin in antioch and syria and cilicia greetings
4512,ACT,15,NRSV,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ
4513,ACT,15,NRSV,we have therefore sent judas and silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth
4514,ACT,15,NRSV,for it has seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication
4515,ACT,15,NRSV,if you keep yourselves from these you will do well
4516,ACT,15,NRSV,farewell
4517,ACT,15,NRSV,so they were sent off and went down to antioch
4518,ACT,15,NRSV,when they gathered the congregation together they delivered the letter
4519,ACT,15,NRSV,when its members read it they rejoiced at the exhortation
4520,ACT,15,NRSV,judas and silas who were themselves prophets said much to encourage and strengthen the believers
4521,ACT,15,NRSV,after they had been there for some time they were sent off in peace by the believers to those who had sent them
4522,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord
4523,ACT,15,NRSV,after some days paul said to barnabas come let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the lord and see how they are doing
4524,ACT,15,NRSV,barnabas wanted to take with them john called mark
4525,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work
4526,ACT,15,NRSV,the disagreement became so sharp that they parted company barnabas took mark with him and sailed away to cyprus
4527,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul chose silas and set out the believers commending him to the grace of the lord
4528,ACT,15,NRSV,he went through syria and cilicia strengthening the churches
4529,ACT,16,NRSV,paul went on also to derbe and to lystra where there was a disciple named timothy the son of a jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a greek
4530,ACT,16,NRSV,he was well spoken of by the believers in lystra and iconium
4531,ACT,16,NRSV,paul wanted timothy to accompany him and he took him and had him circumcised because of the jews who were in those places for they all knew that his father was a greek
4532,ACT,16,NRSV,as they went from town to town they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem
4533,ACT,16,NRSV,so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily
4534,ACT,16,NRSV,they went through the region of phrygia and galatia having been forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in asia
4535,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had come opposite mysia they attempted to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus did not allow them so passing by mysia they went down to troas
4536,ACT,16,NRSV,during the night paul had a vision there stood a man of macedonia pleading with him and saying come over to macedonia and help us
4537,ACT,16,NRSV,when he had seen the vision we immediately tried to cross over to macedonia being convinced that god had called us to proclaim the good news to them
4538,ACT,16,NRSV,we set sail from troas and took a straight course to samothrace the following day to neapolis and from there to philippi which is a leading city of the district of macedonia and a roman colony
4539,ACT,16,NRSV,we remained in this city for some days
4540,ACT,16,NRSV,on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river where we supposed there was a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there
4541,ACT,16,NRSV,a certain woman named lydia a worshiper of god was listening to us she was from the city of thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth
4542,ACT,16,NRSV,the lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by paul
4543,ACT,16,NRSV,when she and her household were baptized she urged us saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come and stay at my home
4544,ACT,16,NRSV,and she prevailed upon us
4545,ACT,16,NRSV,one day as we were going to the place of prayer we met a slavegirl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortunetelling
4546,ACT,16,NRSV,while she followed paul and us she would cry out these men are slaves of the most high god who proclaim to you a way of salvation
4547,ACT,16,NRSV,she kept doing this for many days
4548,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her
4549,ACT,16,NRSV,and it came out that very hour
4550,ACT,16,NRSV,but when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities
4551,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had brought them before the magistrates they said these men are disturbing our city they are jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as romans to adopt or observe
4552,ACT,16,NRSV,the crowd joined in attacking them and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods
4553,ACT,16,NRSV,after they had given them a severe flogging they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely
4554,ACT,16,NRSV,following these instructions he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks
4555,ACT,16,NRSV,about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them
4556,ACT,16,NRSV,suddenly there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyones chains were unfastened
4557,ACT,16,NRSV,when the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped
4558,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul shouted in a loud voice do not harm yourself for we are all here
4559,ACT,16,NRSV,the jailer called for lights and rushing in he fell down trembling before paul and silas
4560,ACT,16,NRSV,then he brought them outside and said sirs what must i do to be saved
4561,ACT,16,NRSV,they answered believe on the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household
4562,ACT,16,NRSV,they spoke the word of the lord to him and to all who were in his house
4563,ACT,16,NRSV,at the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds then he and his entire family were baptized without delay
4564,ACT,16,NRSV,he brought them up into the house and set food before them and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in god
4565,ACT,16,NRSV,when morning came the magistrates sent the police saying let those men go
4566,ACT,16,NRSV,and the jailer reported the message to paul saying the magistrates sent word to let you go therefore come out now and go in peace
4567,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul replied they have beaten us in public uncondemned men who are roman citizens and have thrown us into prison and now are they going to discharge us in secret
4568,ACT,16,NRSV,certainly not let them come and take us out themselves
4569,ACT,16,NRSV,the police reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were roman citizens so they came and apologized to them
4570,ACT,16,NRSV,and they took them out and asked them to leave the city
4571,ACT,16,NRSV,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters there they departed
4572,ACT,17,NRSV,after paul and silas had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews
4573,ACT,17,NRSV,and paul went in as was his custom and on three sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures explaining and proving that it was necessary for the messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying this is the messiah jesus whom i am proclaiming to you
4574,ACT,17,NRSV,some of them were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a great many of the devout greeks and not a few of the leading women
4575,ACT,17,NRSV,but the jews became jealous and with the help of some ruffians in the marketplaces they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar
4576,ACT,17,NRSV,while they were searching for paul and silas to bring them out to the assembly they attacked jasons house
4577,ACT,17,NRSV,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also and jason has entertained them as guests
4578,ACT,17,NRSV,they are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor saying that there is another king named jesus
4579,ACT,17,NRSV,the people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this and after they had taken bail from jason and the others they let them go
4580,ACT,17,NRSV,that very night the believers sent paul and silas off to beroea and when they arrived they went to the jewish synagogue
4581,ACT,17,NRSV,these jews were more receptive than those in thessalonica for they welcomed the message very eagerly and examined the scriptures every day to see whether these things were so
4582,ACT,17,NRSV,many of them therefore believed including not a few greek women and men of high standing
4583,ACT,17,NRSV,but when the jews of thessalonica learned that the word of god had been proclaimed by paul in beroea as well they came there too to stir up and incite the crowds
4584,ACT,17,NRSV,then the believers immediately sent paul away to the coast but silas and timothy remained behind
4585,ACT,17,NRSV,those who conducted paul brought him as far as athens and after receiving instructions to have silas and timothy join him as soon as possible they left him
4586,ACT,17,NRSV,while paul was waiting for them in athens he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols
4587,ACT,17,NRSV,so he argued in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there
4588,ACT,17,NRSV,also some epicurean and stoic philosophers debated with him
4589,ACT,17,NRSV,some said what does this babbler want to say
4590,ACT,17,NRSV,others said he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities
4591,ACT,17,NRSV,this was because he was telling the good news about jesus and the resurrection so they took him and brought him to the areopagus and asked him may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting
4592,ACT,17,NRSV,it sounds rather strange to us so we would like to know what it means
4593,ACT,17,NRSV,now all the athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new
4594,ACT,17,NRSV,then paul stood in front of the areopagus and said athenians i see how extremely religious you are in every way
4595,ACT,17,NRSV,for as i went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship i found among them an altar with the inscription to an unknown god
4596,ACT,17,NRSV,what therefore you worship as unknown this i proclaim to you
4597,ACT,17,NRSV,the god who made the world and everything in it he who is lord of heaven and earth does not live in shrines made by human hands nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things
4598,ACT,17,NRSV,from one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live so that they would search for god and perhaps grope for him and find himthough indeed he is not far from each one of us
4599,ACT,17,NRSV,for in him we live and move and have our being as even some of your own poets have said for we too are his offspring
4600,ACT,17,NRSV,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals
4601,ACT,17,NRSV,while god has overlooked the times of human ignorance now he commands all people everywhere to repent because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead
4602,ACT,17,NRSV,when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some scoffed but others said we will hear you again about this
4603,ACT,17,NRSV,at that point paul left them
4604,ACT,17,NRSV,but some of them joined him and became believers including dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
4605,ACT,18,NRSV,after this paul left athens and went to corinth
4606,ACT,18,NRSV,there he found a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had ordered all jews to leave rome
4607,ACT,18,NRSV,paul went to see them and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and they worked togetherby trade they were tentmakers
4608,ACT,18,NRSV,every sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and would try to convince jews and greeks
4609,ACT,18,NRSV,when silas and timothy arrived from macedonia paul was occupied with proclaiming the word testifying to the jews that the messiah was jesus
4610,ACT,18,NRSV,when they opposed and reviled him in protest he shook the dust from his clothes and said to them your blood be on your own heads i am innocent
4611,ACT,18,NRSV,from now on i will go to the gentiles
4612,ACT,18,NRSV,then he left the synagogue and went to the house of a man named titius justus a worshiper of god his house was next door to the synagogue
4613,ACT,18,NRSV,crispus the official of the synagogue became a believer in the lord together with all his household and many of the corinthians who heard paul became believers and were baptized
4614,ACT,18,NRSV,one night the lord said to paul in a vision do not be afraid but speak and do not be silent for i am with you and no one will lay a hand on you to harm you for there are many in this city who are my people
4615,ACT,18,NRSV,he stayed there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
4616,ACT,18,NRSV,but when gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews made a united attack on paul and brought him before the tribunal
4617,ACT,18,NRSV,they said this man is persuading people to worship god in ways that are contrary to the law
4618,ACT,18,NRSV,just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if it were a matter of crime or serious villainy i would be justified in accepting the complaint of you jews but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters
4619,ACT,18,NRSV,and he dismissed them from the tribunal
4620,ACT,18,NRSV,then all of them seized sosthenes the official of the synagogue and beat him in front of the tribunal
4621,ACT,18,NRSV,but gallio paid no attention to any of these things
4622,ACT,18,NRSV,after staying there for a considerable time paul said farewell to the believers and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila
4623,ACT,18,NRSV,at cenchreae he had his hair cut for he was under a vow
4624,ACT,18,NRSV,when they reached ephesus he left them there but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews
4625,ACT,18,NRSV,when they asked him to stay longer he declined but on taking leave of them he said i will return to you if god wills
4626,ACT,18,NRSV,then he set sail from ephesus
4627,ACT,18,NRSV,when he had landed at caesarea he went up to jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to antioch
4628,ACT,18,NRSV,after spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of galatia and phrygia strengthening all the disciples
4629,ACT,18,NRSV,now there came to ephesus a jew named apollos a native of alexandria
4630,ACT,18,NRSV,he was an eloquent man wellversed in the scriptures
4631,ACT,18,NRSV,he had been instructed in the way of the lord and he spoke with burning enthusiasm and taught accurately the things concerning jesus though he knew only the baptism of john
4632,ACT,18,NRSV,he began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained the way of god to him more accurately
4633,ACT,18,NRSV,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him
4634,ACT,18,NRSV,on his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had become believers for he powerfully refuted the jews in public showing by the scriptures that the messiah is jesus
4635,ACT,19,NRSV,while apollos was in corinth paul passed through the interior regions and came to ephesus where he found some disciples
4636,ACT,19,NRSV,he said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you became believers
4637,ACT,19,NRSV,they replied no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit
4638,ACT,19,NRSV,then he said into what then were you baptized
4639,ACT,19,NRSV,they answered into johns baptism
4640,ACT,19,NRSV,paul said john baptized with the baptism of repentance telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is in jesus
4641,ACT,19,NRSV,on hearing this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
4642,ACT,19,NRSV,when paul had laid his hands on them the holy spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied altogether there were about twelve of them
4643,ACT,19,NRSV,he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly and argued persuasively about the kingdom of god
4644,ACT,19,NRSV,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus
4645,ACT,19,NRSV,this continued for two years so that all the residents of asia both jews and greeks heard the word of the lord
4646,ACT,19,NRSV,god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them
4647,ACT,19,NRSV,then some itinerant jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the lord jesus over those who had evil spirits saying i adjure you by the jesus whom paul proclaims
4648,ACT,19,NRSV,seven sons of a jewish high priest named sceva were doing this
4649,ACT,19,NRSV,but the evil spirit said to them in reply jesus i know and paul i know but who are you
4650,ACT,19,NRSV,then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them mastered them all and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded
4651,ACT,19,NRSV,when this became known to all residents of ephesus both jews and greeks everyone was awestruck and the name of the lord jesus was praised
4652,ACT,19,NRSV,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices
4653,ACT,19,NRSV,a number of those who practiced magic collected their books and burned them publicly when the value of these books was calculated it was found to come to fifty thousand silver coins
4654,ACT,19,NRSV,so the word of the lord grew mightily and prevailed
4655,ACT,19,NRSV,now after these things had been accomplished paul resolved in the spirit to go through macedonia and achaia and then to go on to jerusalem
4656,ACT,19,NRSV,he said after i have gone there i must also see rome
4657,ACT,19,NRSV,so he sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus to macedonia while he himself stayed for some time longer in asia
4658,ACT,19,NRSV,about that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the way
4659,ACT,19,NRSV,a man named demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of artemis brought no little business to the artisans
4660,ACT,19,NRSV,these he gathered together with the workers of the same trade and said men you know that we get our wealth from this business
4661,ACT,19,NRSV,you also see and hear that not only in ephesus but in almost the whole of asia this paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods
4662,ACT,19,NRSV,and there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be scorned and she will be deprived of her majesty that brought all asia and the world to worship her
4663,ACT,19,NRSV,when they heard this they were enraged and shouted great is artemis of the ephesians the city was filled with the confusion and people rushed together to the theater dragging with them gaius and aristarchus macedonians who were pauls travel companions
4664,ACT,19,NRSV,paul wished to go into the crowd but the disciples would not let him even some officials of the province of asia who were friendly to him sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater
4665,ACT,19,NRSV,meanwhile some were shouting one thing some another for the assembly was in confusion and most of them did not know why they had come together
4666,ACT,19,NRSV,some of the crowd gave instructions to alexander whom the jews had pushed forward
4667,ACT,19,NRSV,and alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people
4668,ACT,19,NRSV,but when they recognized that he was a jew for about two hours all of them shouted in unison great is artemis of the ephesians but when the town clerk had quieted the crowd he said citizens of ephesus who is there that does not know that the city of the ephesians is the temple keeper of the great artemis and of the statue that fell from heaven
4669,ACT,19,NRSV,since these things cannot be denied you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash
4670,ACT,19,NRSV,you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess
4671,ACT,19,NRSV,if therefore demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them bring charges there against one another
4672,ACT,19,NRSV,if there is anything further you want to know it must be settled in the regular assembly
4673,ACT,19,NRSV,for we are in danger of being charged with rioting today since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion
4674,ACT,19,NRSV,when he had said this he dismissed the assembly
4675,ACT,20,NRSV,after the uproar had ceased paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them and saying farewell he left for macedonia
4676,ACT,20,NRSV,when he had gone through those regions and had given the believers much encouragement he came to greece where he stayed for three months
4677,ACT,20,NRSV,he was about to set sail for syria when a plot was made against him by the jews and so he decided to return through macedonia
4678,ACT,20,NRSV,he was accompanied by sopater son of pyrrhus from beroea by aristarchus and secundus from thessalonica by gaius from derbe and by timothy as well as by tychicus and trophimus from asia
4679,ACT,20,NRSV,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days
4680,ACT,20,NRSV,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight
4681,ACT,20,NRSV,there were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting
4682,ACT,20,NRSV,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer
4683,ACT,20,NRSV,overcome by sleep he fell to the ground three floors below and was picked up dead
4684,ACT,20,NRSV,but paul went down and bending over him took him in his arms and said do not be alarmed for his life is in him
4685,ACT,20,NRSV,then paul went upstairs and after he had broken bread and eaten he continued to converse with them until dawn then he left
4686,ACT,20,NRSV,meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted
4687,ACT,20,NRSV,we went ahead to the ship and set sail for assos intending to take paul on board there for he had made this arrangement intending to go by land himself
4688,ACT,20,NRSV,when he met us in assos we took him on board and went to mitylene
4689,ACT,20,NRSV,we sailed from there and on the following day we arrived opposite chios
4690,ACT,20,NRSV,the next day we touched at samos and the day after that we came to miletus
4691,ACT,20,NRSV,for paul had decided to sail past ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in asia he was eager to be in jerusalem if possible on the day of pentecost
4692,ACT,20,NRSV,from miletus he sent a message to ephesus asking the elders of the church to meet him
4693,ACT,20,NRSV,when they came to him he said to them you yourselves know how i lived among you the entire time from the first day that i set foot in asia serving the lord with all humility and with tears enduring the trials that came to me through the plots of the jews
4694,ACT,20,NRSV,i did not shrink from doing anything helpful proclaiming the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house as i testified to both jews and greeks about repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus
4695,ACT,20,NRSV,and now as a captive to the spirit i am on my way to jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there except that the holy spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me
4696,ACT,20,NRSV,but i do not count my life of any value to myself if only i may finish my course and the ministry that i received from the lord jesus to testify to the good news of gods grace
4697,ACT,20,NRSV,and now i know that none of you among whom i have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will ever see my face again
4698,ACT,20,NRSV,therefore i declare to you this day that i am not responsible for the blood of any of you for i did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of god
4699,ACT,20,NRSV,keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock of which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god that he obtained with the blood of his own son
4700,ACT,20,NRSV,i know that after i have gone savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock
4701,ACT,20,NRSV,some even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them
4702,ACT,20,NRSV,therefore be alert remembering that for three years i did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears
4703,ACT,20,NRSV,and now i commend you to god and to the message of his grace a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified
4704,ACT,20,NRSV,i coveted no ones silver or gold or clothing
4705,ACT,20,NRSV,you know for yourselves that i worked with my own hands to support myself and my companions
4706,ACT,20,NRSV,in all this i have given you an example that by such work we must support the weak remembering the words of the lord jesus for he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive
4707,ACT,20,NRSV,when he had finished speaking he knelt down with them all and prayed
4708,ACT,20,NRSV,there was much weeping among them all they embraced paul and kissed him grieving especially because of what he had said that they would not see him again
4709,ACT,20,NRSV,then they brought him to the ship
4710,ACT,21,NRSV,when we had parted from them and set sail we came by a straight course to cos and the next day to rhodes and from there to patara
4711,ACT,21,NRSV,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail
4712,ACT,21,NRSV,we came in sight of cyprus and leaving it on our left we sailed to syria and landed at tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there
4713,ACT,21,NRSV,we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days
4714,ACT,21,NRSV,through the spirit they told paul not to go on to jerusalem
4715,ACT,21,NRSV,when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey and all of them with wives and children escorted us outside the city
4716,ACT,21,NRSV,there we knelt down on the beach and prayed and said farewell to one another
4717,ACT,21,NRSV,then we went on board the ship and they returned home
4718,ACT,21,NRSV,when we had finished the voyage from tyre we arrived at ptolemais and we greeted the believers and stayed with them for one day
4719,ACT,21,NRSV,the next day we left and came to caesarea and we went into the house of philip the evangelist one of the seven and stayed with him
4720,ACT,21,NRSV,he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy
4721,ACT,21,NRSV,while we were staying there for several days a prophet named agabus came down from judea
4722,ACT,21,NRSV,he came to us and took pauls belt bound his own feet and hands with it and said thus says the holy spirit this is the way the jews in jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles
4723,ACT,21,NRSV,when we heard this we and the people there urged him not to go up to jerusalem
4724,ACT,21,NRSV,then paul answered what are you doing weeping and breaking my heart
4725,ACT,21,NRSV,for i am ready not only to be bound but even to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
4726,ACT,21,NRSV,since he would not be persuaded we remained silent except to say the lords will be done
4727,ACT,21,NRSV,after these days we got ready and started to go up to jerusalem
4728,ACT,21,NRSV,some of the disciples from caesarea also came along and brought us to the house of mnason of cyprus an early disciple with whom we were to stay
4729,ACT,21,NRSV,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly
4730,ACT,21,NRSV,the next day paul went with us to visit james and all the elders were present
4731,ACT,21,NRSV,after greeting them he related one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry
4732,ACT,21,NRSV,when they heard it they praised god
4733,ACT,21,NRSV,then they said to him you see brother how many thousands of believers there are among the jews and they are all zealous for the law
4734,ACT,21,NRSV,they have been told about you that you teach all the jews living among the gentiles to forsake moses and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs
4735,ACT,21,NRSV,what then is to be done
4736,ACT,21,NRSV,they will certainly hear that you have come
4737,ACT,21,NRSV,so do what we tell you
4738,ACT,21,NRSV,we have four men who are under a vow
4739,ACT,21,NRSV,join these men go through the rite of purification with them and pay for the shaving of their heads
4740,ACT,21,NRSV,thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself observe and guard the law
4741,ACT,21,NRSV,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication
4742,ACT,21,NRSV,then paul took the men and the next day having purified himself he entered the temple with them making public the completion of the days of purification when the sacrifice would be made for each of them
4743,ACT,21,NRSV,when the seven days were almost completed the jews from asia who had seen him in the temple stirred up the whole crowd
4744,ACT,21,NRSV,they seized him shouting fellow israelites help this is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people our law and this place more than that he has actually brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place
4745,ACT,21,NRSV,for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with him in the city and they supposed that paul had brought him into the temple
4746,ACT,21,NRSV,then all the city was aroused and the people rushed together
4747,ACT,21,NRSV,they seized paul and dragged him out of the temple and immediately the doors were shut
4748,ACT,21,NRSV,while they were trying to kill him word came to the tribune of the cohort that all jerusalem was in an uproar
4749,ACT,21,NRSV,immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them
4750,ACT,21,NRSV,when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul
4751,ACT,21,NRSV,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done
4752,ACT,21,NRSV,some in the crowd shouted one thing some another and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar he ordered him to be brought into the barracks
4753,ACT,21,NRSV,when paul came to the steps the violence of the mob was so great that he had to be carried by the soldiers
4754,ACT,21,NRSV,the crowd that followed kept shouting away with him just as paul was about to be brought into the barracks he said to the tribune may i say something to you
4755,ACT,21,NRSV,the tribune replied do you know greek
4756,ACT,21,NRSV,then you are not the egyptian who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness
4757,ACT,21,NRSV,paul replied i am a jew from tarsus in cilicia a citizen of an important city i beg you let me speak to the people
4758,ACT,21,NRSV,when he had given him permission paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence and when there was a great hush he addressed them in the hebrew language saying
4759,ACT,22,NRSV,brothers and fathers listen to the defense that i now make before you
4760,ACT,22,NRSV,when they heard him addressing them in hebrew they became even more quiet
4761,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said i am a jew born in tarsus in cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel educated strictly according to our ancestral law being zealous for god just as all of you are today
4762,ACT,22,NRSV,i persecuted this way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me
4763,ACT,22,NRSV,from them i also received letters to the brothers in damascus and i went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to jerusalem for punishment
4764,ACT,22,NRSV,while i was on my way and approaching damascus about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me
4765,ACT,22,NRSV,i fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me saul saul why are you persecuting me
4766,ACT,22,NRSV,i answered who are you lord
4767,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are persecuting
4768,ACT,22,NRSV,now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me
4769,ACT,22,NRSV,i asked what am i to do lord
4770,ACT,22,NRSV,the lord said to me get up and go to damascus there you will be told everything that has been assigned to you to do
4771,ACT,22,NRSV,since i could not see because of the brightness of that light those who were with me took my hand and led me to damascus
4772,ACT,22,NRSV,a certain ananias who was a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the jews living there came to me and standing beside me he said brother saul regain your sight in that very hour i regained my sight and saw him
4773,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said the god of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will to see the righteous one and to hear his own voice for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard
4774,ACT,22,NRSV,and now why do you delay
4775,ACT,22,NRSV,get up be baptized and have your sins washed away calling on his name
4776,ACT,22,NRSV,after i had returned to jerusalem and while i was praying in the temple i fell into a trance and saw jesus saying to me hurry and get out of jerusalem quickly because they will not accept your testimony about me
4777,ACT,22,NRSV,and i said lord they themselves know that in every synagogue i imprisoned and beat those who believed in you
4778,ACT,22,NRSV,and while the blood of your witness stephen was shed i myself was standing by approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him
4779,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles
4780,ACT,22,NRSV,up to this point they listened to him but then they shouted away with such a fellow from the earth for he should not be allowed to live
4781,ACT,22,NRSV,and while they were shouting throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks and ordered him to be examined by flogging to find out the reason for this outcry against him
4782,ACT,22,NRSV,but when they had tied him up with thongs paul said to the centurion who was standing by is it legal for you to flog a roman citizen who is uncondemned
4783,ACT,22,NRSV,when the centurion heard that he went to the tribune and said to him what are you about to do
4784,ACT,22,NRSV,this man is a roman citizen
4785,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune came and asked paul tell me are you a roman citizen
4786,ACT,22,NRSV,and he said yes
4787,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune answered it cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship
4788,ACT,22,NRSV,paul said but i was born a citizen
4789,ACT,22,NRSV,immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him and the tribune also was afraid for he realized that paul was a roman citizen and that he had bound him
4790,ACT,22,NRSV,since he wanted to find out what paul was being accused of by the jews the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet
4791,ACT,22,NRSV,he brought paul down and had him stand before them
4792,ACT,23,NRSV,while paul was looking intently at the council he said brothers up to this day i have lived my life with a clear conscience before god
4793,ACT,23,NRSV,then the high priest ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth
4794,ACT,23,NRSV,at this paul said to him god will strike you you whitewashed wall are you sitting there to judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck
4795,ACT,23,NRSV,those standing nearby said do you dare to insult gods high priest
4796,ACT,23,NRSV,and paul said i did not realize brothers that he was high priest for it is written you shall not speak evil of a leader of your people
4797,ACT,23,NRSV,when paul noticed that some were sadducees and others were pharisees he called out in the council brothers i am a pharisee a son of pharisees
4798,ACT,23,NRSV,i am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead
4799,ACT,23,NRSV,when he said this a dissension began between the pharisees and the sadducees and the assembly was divided
4800,ACT,23,NRSV,the sadducees say that there is no resurrection or angel or spirit but the pharisees acknowledge all three then a great clamor arose and certain scribes of the pharisees group stood up and contended we find nothing wrong with this man
4801,ACT,23,NRSV,what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him
4802,ACT,23,NRSV,when the dissension became violent the tribune fearing that they would tear paul to pieces ordered the soldiers to go down take him by force and bring him into the barracks
4803,ACT,23,NRSV,that night the lord stood near him and said keep up your courage for just as you have testified for me in jerusalem so you must bear witness also in rome
4804,ACT,23,NRSV,in the morning the jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed paul
4805,ACT,23,NRSV,there were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy
4806,ACT,23,NRSV,they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed paul
4807,ACT,23,NRSV,now then you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case
4808,ACT,23,NRSV,and we are ready to do away with him before he arrives
4809,ACT,23,NRSV,now the son of pauls sister heard about the ambush so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told paul
4810,ACT,23,NRSV,paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the tribune for he has something to report to him
4811,ACT,23,NRSV,so he took him brought him to the tribune and said the prisoner paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you he has something to tell you
4812,ACT,23,NRSV,the tribune took him by the hand drew him aside privately and asked what is it that you have to report to me
4813,ACT,23,NRSV,he answered the jews have agreed to ask you to bring paul down to the council tomorrow as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into his case
4814,ACT,23,NRSV,but do not be persuaded by them for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him
4815,ACT,23,NRSV,they have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him
4816,ACT,23,NRSV,they are ready now and are waiting for your consent
4817,ACT,23,NRSV,so the tribune dismissed the young man ordering him tell no one that you have informed me of this
4818,ACT,23,NRSV,then he summoned two of the centurions and said get ready to leave by nine oclock tonight for caesarea with two hundred soldiers seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen
4819,ACT,23,NRSV,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor
4820,ACT,23,NRSV,he wrote a letter to this effect claudius lysias to his excellency the governor felix greetings
4821,ACT,23,NRSV,this man was seized by the jews and was about to be killed by them but when i had learned that he was a roman citizen i came with the guard and rescued him
4822,ACT,23,NRSV,since i wanted to know the charge for which they accused him i had him brought to their council
4823,ACT,23,NRSV,i found that he was accused concerning questions of their law but was charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment
4824,ACT,23,NRSV,when i was informed that there would be a plot against the man i sent him to you at once ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him
4825,ACT,23,NRSV,so the soldiers according to their instructions took paul and brought him during the night to antipatris
4826,ACT,23,NRSV,the next day they let the horsemen go on with him while they returned to the barracks
4827,ACT,23,NRSV,when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they presented paul also before him
4828,ACT,23,NRSV,on reading the letter he asked what province he belonged to and when he learned that he was from cilicia he said i will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive
4829,ACT,23,NRSV,then he ordered that he be kept under guard in herods headquarters
4830,ACT,24,NRSV,five days later the high priest ananias came down with some elders and an attorney a certain tertullus and they reported their case against paul to the governor
4831,ACT,24,NRSV,when paul had been summoned tertullus began to accuse him saying your excellency because of you we have long enjoyed peace and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight
4832,ACT,24,NRSV,we welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude
4833,ACT,24,NRSV,but to detain you no further i beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness
4834,ACT,24,NRSV,we have in fact found this man a pestilent fellow an agitator among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
4835,ACT,24,NRSV,he even tried to profane the temple and so we seized him
4836,ACT,24,NRSV,by examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him
4837,ACT,24,NRSV,the jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true
4838,ACT,24,NRSV,when the governor motioned to him to speak paul replied i cheerfully make my defense knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation
4839,ACT,24,NRSV,as you can find out it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship in jerusalem
4840,ACT,24,NRSV,they did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city
4841,ACT,24,NRSV,neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me
4842,ACT,24,NRSV,but this i admit to you that according to the way which they call a sect i worship the god of our ancestors believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets
4843,ACT,24,NRSV,i have a hope in goda hope that they themselves also acceptthat there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous
4844,ACT,24,NRSV,therefore i do my best always to have a clear conscience toward god and all people
4845,ACT,24,NRSV,now after some years i came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices
4846,ACT,24,NRSV,while i was doing this they found me in the temple completing the rite of purification without any crowd or disturbance
4847,ACT,24,NRSV,but there were some jews from asiathey ought to be here before you to make an accusation if they have anything against me
4848,ACT,24,NRSV,or let these men here tell what crime they had found when i stood before the council unless it was this one sentence that i called out while standing before them it is about the resurrection of the dead that i am on trial before you today
4849,ACT,24,NRSV,but felix who was rather well informed about the way adjourned the hearing with the comment when lysias the tribune comes down i will decide your case
4850,ACT,24,NRSV,then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs
4851,ACT,24,NRSV,some days later when felix came with his wife drusilla who was jewish he sent for paul and heard him speak concerning faith in christ jesus
4852,ACT,24,NRSV,and as he discussed justice selfcontrol and the coming judgment felix became frightened and said go away for the present when i have an opportunity i will send for you
4853,ACT,24,NRSV,at the same time he hoped that money would be given him by paul and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him
4854,ACT,24,NRSV,after two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and since he wanted to grant the jews a favor felix left paul in prison
4855,ACT,25,NRSV,three days after festus had arrived in the province he went up from caesarea to jerusalem where the chief priests and the leaders of the jews gave him a report against paul
4856,ACT,25,NRSV,they appealed to him and requested as a favor to them against paul to have him transferred to jerusalem
4857,ACT,25,NRSV,they were in fact planning an ambush to kill him along the way
4858,ACT,25,NRSV,festus replied that paul was being kept at caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly
4859,ACT,25,NRSV,so he said let those of you who have the authority come down with me and if there is anything wrong about the man let them accuse him
4860,ACT,25,NRSV,after he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days he went down to caesarea the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered paul to be brought
4861,ACT,25,NRSV,when he arrived the jews who had gone down from jerusalem surrounded him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove
4862,ACT,25,NRSV,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor
4863,ACT,25,NRSV,but festus wishing to do the jews a favor asked paul do you wish to go up to jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges
4864,ACT,25,NRSV,paul said i am appealing to the emperors tribunal this is where i should be tried
4865,ACT,25,NRSV,i have done no wrong to the jews as you very well know
4866,ACT,25,NRSV,now if i am in the wrong and have committed something for which i deserve to die i am not trying to escape death but if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can turn me over to them
4867,ACT,25,NRSV,i appeal to the emperor
4868,ACT,25,NRSV,then festus after he had conferred with his council replied you have appealed to the emperor to the emperor you will go
4869,ACT,25,NRSV,after several days had passed king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea to welcome festus
4870,ACT,25,NRSV,since they were staying there several days festus laid pauls case before the king saying there is a man here who was left in prison by felix
4871,ACT,25,NRSV,when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him
4872,ACT,25,NRSV,i told them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge
4873,ACT,25,NRSV,so when they met here i lost no time but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought
4874,ACT,25,NRSV,when the accusers stood up they did not charge him with any of the crimes that i was expecting
4875,ACT,25,NRSV,instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain jesus who had died but whom paul asserted to be alive
4876,ACT,25,NRSV,since i was at a loss how to investigate these questions i asked whether he wished to go to jerusalem and be tried there on these charges
4877,ACT,25,NRSV,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor
4878,ACT,25,NRSV,agrippa said to festus i would like to hear the man myself
4879,ACT,25,NRSV,tomorrow he said you will hear him
4880,ACT,25,NRSV,so on the next day agrippa and bernice came with great pomp and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city
4881,ACT,25,NRSV,then festus gave the order and paul was brought in
4882,ACT,25,NRSV,and festus said king agrippa and all here present with us you see this man about whom the whole jewish community petitioned me both in jerusalem and here shouting that he ought not to live any longer
4883,ACT,25,NRSV,but i found that he had done nothing deserving death and when he appealed to his imperial majesty i decided to send him
4884,ACT,25,NRSV,but i have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him
4885,ACT,25,NRSV,therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that after we have examined him i may have something to write for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him
4886,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul you have permission to speak for yourself
4887,ACT,26,NRSV,then paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself i consider myself fortunate that it is before you king agrippa i am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the jews because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the jews therefore i beg of you to listen to me patiently
4888,ACT,26,NRSV,all the jews know my way of life from my youth a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in jerusalem
4889,ACT,26,NRSV,they have known for a long time if they are willing to testify that i have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a pharisee
4890,ACT,26,NRSV,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night
4891,ACT,26,NRSV,it is for this hope your excellency that i am accused by jews why is it thought incredible by any of you that god raises the dead
4892,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed i myself was convinced that i ought to do many things against the name of jesus of nazareth
4893,ACT,26,NRSV,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death
4894,ACT,26,NRSV,by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to blaspheme and since i was so furiously enraged at them i pursued them even to foreign cities
4895,ACT,26,NRSV,with this in mind i was traveling to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests when at midday along the road your excellency i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions
4896,ACT,26,NRSV,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me
4897,ACT,26,NRSV,it hurts you to kick against the goads
4898,ACT,26,NRSV,i asked who are you lord
4899,ACT,26,NRSV,the lord answered i am jesus whom you are persecuting
4900,ACT,26,NRSV,but get up and stand on your feet for i have appeared to you for this purpose to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which i will appear to you
4901,ACT,26,NRSV,i will rescue you from your people and from the gentilesto whom i am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
4902,ACT,26,NRSV,after that king agrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but declared first to those in damascus then in jerusalem and throughout the countryside of judea and also to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do deeds consistent with repentance
4903,ACT,26,NRSV,for this reason the jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me
4904,ACT,26,NRSV,to this day i have had help from god and so i stand here testifying to both small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would take place that the messiah must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the gentiles
4905,ACT,26,NRSV,while he was making this defense festus exclaimed you are out of your mind paul too much learning is driving you insane but paul said i am not out of my mind most excellent festus but i am speaking the sober truth
4906,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed the king knows about these things and to him i speak freely for i am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice for this was not done in a corner
4907,ACT,26,NRSV,king agrippa do you believe the prophets
4908,ACT,26,NRSV,i know that you believe
4909,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul are you so quickly persuading me to become a christian
4910,ACT,26,NRSV,paul replied whether quickly or not i pray to god that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as i amexcept for these chains
4911,ACT,26,NRSV,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment
4912,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to festus this man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor
4913,ACT,27,NRSV,when it was decided that we were to sail for italy they transferred paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the augustan cohort named julius
4914,ACT,27,NRSV,embarking on a ship of adramyttium that was about to set sail to the ports along the coast of asia we put to sea accompanied by aristarchus a macedonian from thessalonica
4915,ACT,27,NRSV,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for
4916,ACT,27,NRSV,putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of cyprus because the winds were against us
4917,ACT,27,NRSV,after we had sailed across the sea that is off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia
4918,ACT,27,NRSV,there the centurion found an alexandrian ship bound for italy and put us on board
4919,ACT,27,NRSV,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone
4920,ACT,27,NRSV,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea
4921,ACT,27,NRSV,since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous because even the fast had already gone by paul advised them saying sirs i can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives
4922,ACT,27,NRSV,but the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what paul said
4923,ACT,27,NRSV,since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach phoenix where they could spend the winter
4924,ACT,27,NRSV,it was a harbor of crete facing southwest and northwest
4925,ACT,27,NRSV,when a moderate south wind began to blow they thought they could achieve their purpose so they weighed anchor and began to sail past crete close to the shore
4926,ACT,27,NRSV,but soon a violent wind called the northeaster rushed down from crete
4927,ACT,27,NRSV,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven
4928,ACT,27,NRSV,by running under the lee of a small island called cauda we were scarcely able to get the ships boat under control
4929,ACT,27,NRSV,after hoisting it up they took measures to undergird the ship then fearing that they would run on the syrtis they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven
4930,ACT,27,NRSV,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard
4931,ACT,27,NRSV,when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small tempest raged all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned
4932,ACT,27,NRSV,since they had been without food for a long time paul then stood up among them and said men you should have listened to me and not have set sail from crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss
4933,ACT,27,NRSV,i urge you now to keep up your courage for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship
4934,ACT,27,NRSV,for last night there stood by me an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i worship and he said do not be afraid paul you must stand before the emperor and indeed god has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you
4935,ACT,27,NRSV,so keep up your courage men for i have faith in god that it will be exactly as i have been told
4936,ACT,27,NRSV,but we will have to run aground on some island
4937,ACT,27,NRSV,when the fourteenth night had come as we were drifting across the sea of adria about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land
4938,ACT,27,NRSV,so they took soundings and found twenty fathoms a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms
4939,ACT,27,NRSV,fearing that we might run on the rocks they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come
4940,ACT,27,NRSV,but when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow paul said to the centurion and the soldiers unless these men stay in the ship you cannot be saved
4941,ACT,27,NRSV,then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift
4942,ACT,27,NRSV,just before daybreak paul urged all of them to take some food saying today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and remaining without food having eaten nothing
4943,ACT,27,NRSV,therefore i urge you to take some food for it will help you survive for none of you will lose a hair from your heads
4944,ACT,27,NRSV,after he had said this he took bread and giving thanks to god in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat
4945,ACT,27,NRSV,then all of them were encouraged and took food for themselves
4946,ACT,27,NRSV,we were in all two hundred seventysix persons in the ship after they had satisfied their hunger they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea
4947,ACT,27,NRSV,in the morning they did not recognize the land but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if they could
4948,ACT,27,NRSV,so they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea
4949,ACT,27,NRSV,at the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steeringoars then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach
4950,ACT,27,NRSV,but striking a reef they ran the ship aground the bow stuck and remained immovable but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves
4951,ACT,27,NRSV,the soldiers plan was to kill the prisoners so that none might swim away and escape but the centurion wishing to save paul kept them from carrying out their plan
4952,ACT,27,NRSV,he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land and the rest to follow some on planks and others on pieces of the ship
4953,ACT,27,NRSV,and so it was that all were brought safely to land
4954,ACT,28,NRSV,after we had reached safety we then learned that the island was called malta
4955,ACT,28,NRSV,the natives showed us unusual kindness
4956,ACT,28,NRSV,since it had begun to rain and was cold they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us around it
4957,ACT,28,NRSV,paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand
4958,ACT,28,NRSV,when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand they said to one another this man must be a murderer though he has escaped from the sea justice has not allowed him to live
4959,ACT,28,NRSV,he however shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm
4960,ACT,28,NRSV,they were expecting him to swell up or drop dead but after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing unusual had happened to him they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god
4961,ACT,28,NRSV,now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island named publius who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days
4962,ACT,28,NRSV,it so happened that the father of publius lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery
4963,ACT,28,NRSV,paul visited him and cured him by praying and putting his hands on him
4964,ACT,28,NRSV,after this happened the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured
4965,ACT,28,NRSV,they bestowed many honors on us and when we were about to sail they put on board all the provisions we needed
4966,ACT,28,NRSV,three months later we set sail on a ship that had wintered at the island an alexandrian ship with the twin brothers as its figurehead
4967,ACT,28,NRSV,we put in at syracuse and stayed there for three days then we weighed anchor and came to rhegium
4968,ACT,28,NRSV,after one day there a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to puteoli
4969,ACT,28,NRSV,there we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days
4970,ACT,28,NRSV,and so we came to rome
4971,ACT,28,NRSV,the believers from there when they heard of us came as far as the forum of appius and three taverns to meet us
4972,ACT,28,NRSV,on seeing them paul thanked god and took courage
4973,ACT,28,NRSV,when we came into rome paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him
4974,ACT,28,NRSV,three days later he called together the local leaders of the jews
4975,ACT,28,NRSV,when they had assembled he said to them brothers though i had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors yet i was arrested in jerusalem and handed over to the romans
4976,ACT,28,NRSV,when they had examined me the romans wanted to release me because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case
4977,ACT,28,NRSV,but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to the emperoreven though i had no charge to bring against my nation
4978,ACT,28,NRSV,for this reason therefore i have asked to see you and speak with you since it is for the sake of the hope of israel that i am bound with this chain
4979,ACT,28,NRSV,they replied we have received no letters from judea about you and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you
4980,ACT,28,NRSV,but we would like to hear from you what you think for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against
4981,ACT,28,NRSV,after they had set a day to meet with him they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers
4982,ACT,28,NRSV,from morning until evening he explained the matter to them testifying to the kingdom of god and trying to convince them about jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets
4983,ACT,28,NRSV,some were convinced by what he had said while others refused to believe
4984,ACT,28,NRSV,so they disagreed with each other and as they were leaving paul made one further statement the holy spirit was right in saying to your ancestors through the prophet isaiah go to this people and say you will indeed listen but never understand and you will indeed look but never perceive
4985,ACT,28,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes so that they might not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them
4986,ACT,28,NRSV,let it be known to you then that this salvation of god has been sent to the gentiles they will listen
4987,ACT,28,NRSV,he lived there two whole years at his own expense and welcomed all who came to him proclaiming the kingdom of god and teaching about the lord jesus christ with all boldness and without hindrance
4988,ROM,1,NRSV,paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
4989,ROM,1,NRSV,first i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you because your faith is proclaimed throughout the world
4990,ROM,1,NRSV,for god whom i serve with my spirit by announcing the gospel of his son is my witness that without ceasing i remember you always in my prayers asking that by gods will i may somehow at last succeed in coming to you
4991,ROM,1,NRSV,for i am longing to see you so that i may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you or rather so that we may be mutually encouraged by each others faith both yours and mine
4992,ROM,1,NRSV,i want you to know brothers and sisters that i have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented in order that i may reap some harvest among you as i have among the rest of the gentiles
4993,ROM,1,NRSV,i am a debtor both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish hence my eagerness to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in rome
4994,ROM,1,NRSV,for i am not ashamed of the gospel it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and also to the greek
4995,ROM,1,NRSV,for in it the righteousness of god is revealed through faith for faith as it is written the one who is righteous will live by faith
4996,ROM,1,NRSV,for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those who by their wickedness suppress the truth
4997,ROM,1,NRSV,for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them
4998,ROM,1,NRSV,ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature invisible though they are have been understood and seen through the things he has made
4999,ROM,1,NRSV,so they are without excuse for though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened
5000,ROM,1,NRSV,claiming to be wise they became fools and they exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or fourfooted animals or reptiles
5001,ROM,1,NRSV,therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the degrading of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen
5002,ROM,1,NRSV,for this reason god gave them up to degrading passions
5003,ROM,1,NRSV,their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural and in the same way also the men giving up natural intercourse with women were consumed with passion for one another
5004,ROM,1,NRSV,men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error
5005,ROM,1,NRSV,and since they did not see fit to acknowledge god god gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done
5006,ROM,1,NRSV,they were filled with every kind of wickedness evil covetousness malice
5007,ROM,1,NRSV,full of envy murder strife deceit craftiness they are gossips slanderers godhaters insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil rebellious toward parents foolish faithless heartless ruthless
5008,ROM,1,NRSV,they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to dieyet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them
5009,ROM,2,NRSV,therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things
5010,ROM,2,NRSV,you say we know that gods judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth
5011,ROM,2,NRSV,do you imagine whoever you are that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself you will escape the judgment of god
5012,ROM,2,NRSV,or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience
5013,ROM,2,NRSV,do you not realize that gods kindness is meant to lead you to repentance
5014,ROM,2,NRSV,but by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when gods righteous judgment will be revealed
5015,ROM,2,NRSV,for he will repay according to each ones deeds to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life while for those who are selfseeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness there will be wrath and fury
5016,ROM,2,NRSV,there will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil the jew first and also the greek but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good the jew first and also the greek
5017,ROM,2,NRSV,for god shows no partiality
5018,ROM,2,NRSV,all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law
5019,ROM,2,NRSV,for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in gods sight but the doers of the law who will be justified
5020,ROM,2,NRSV,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves
5021,ROM,2,NRSV,they show that what the law requires is written on their hearts to which their own conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them on the day when according to my gospel god through jesus christ will judge the secret thoughts of all
5022,ROM,2,NRSV,but if you call yourself a jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to god and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness a corrector of the foolish a teacher of children having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth you then that teach others will you not teach yourself
5023,ROM,2,NRSV,while you preach against stealing do you steal
5024,ROM,2,NRSV,you that forbid adultery do you commit adultery
5025,ROM,2,NRSV,you that abhor idols do you rob temples
5026,ROM,2,NRSV,you that boast in the law do you dishonor god by breaking the law
5027,ROM,2,NRSV,for as it is written the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you
5028,ROM,2,NRSV,circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law but if you break the law your circumcision has become uncircumcision
5029,ROM,2,NRSV,so if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision
5030,ROM,2,NRSV,then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law
5031,ROM,2,NRSV,for a person is not a jew who is one outwardly nor is true circumcision something external and physical
5032,ROM,2,NRSV,rather a person is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heartit is spiritual and not literal
5033,ROM,2,NRSV,such a person receives praise not from others but from god
5034,ROM,3,NRSV,then what advantage has the jew
5035,ROM,3,NRSV,or what is the value of circumcision
5036,ROM,3,NRSV,much in every way
5037,ROM,3,NRSV,for in the first place the jews were entrusted with the oracles of god
5038,ROM,3,NRSV,what if some were unfaithful
5039,ROM,3,NRSV,will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of god
5040,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means although everyone is a liar let god be proved true as it is written so that you may be justified in your words and prevail in your judging
5041,ROM,3,NRSV,but if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of god what should we say
5042,ROM,3,NRSV,that god is unjust to inflict wrath on us
5043,ROM,3,NRSV,i speak in a human way by no means for then how could god judge the world
5044,ROM,3,NRSV,but if through my falsehood gods truthfulness abounds to his glory why am i still being condemned as a sinner
5045,ROM,3,NRSV,and why not say as some people slander us by saying that we say let us do evil so that good may come
5046,ROM,3,NRSV,their condemnation is deserved what then
5047,ROM,3,NRSV,are we any better off
5048,ROM,3,NRSV,no not at all for we have already charged that all both jews and greeks are under the power of sin as it is written there is no one who is righteous not even one there is no one who has understanding there is no one who seeks god
5049,ROM,3,NRSV,all have turned aside together they have become worthless there is no one who shows kindness there is not even one
5050,ROM,3,NRSV,their throats are opened graves they use their tongues to deceive
5051,ROM,3,NRSV,the venom of vipers is under their lips
5052,ROM,3,NRSV,their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness
5053,ROM,3,NRSV,their feet are swift to shed blood ruin and misery are in their paths and the way of peace they have not known
5054,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no fear of god before their eyes
5055,ROM,3,NRSV,now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to god
5056,ROM,3,NRSV,for no human being will be justified in his sight by deeds prescribed by the law for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
5057,ROM,3,NRSV,but now apart from law the righteousness of god has been disclosed and is attested by the law and the prophets the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe
5058,ROM,3,NRSV,for there is no distinction since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god they are now justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood effective through faith
5059,ROM,3,NRSV,he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus
5060,ROM,3,NRSV,then what becomes of boasting
5061,ROM,3,NRSV,it is excluded
5062,ROM,3,NRSV,by what law
5063,ROM,3,NRSV,by that of works
5064,ROM,3,NRSV,no but by the law of faith
5065,ROM,3,NRSV,for we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law
5066,ROM,3,NRSV,or is god the god of jews only
5067,ROM,3,NRSV,is he not the god of gentiles also
5068,ROM,3,NRSV,yes of gentiles also since god is one and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith
5069,ROM,3,NRSV,do we then overthrow the law by this faith
5070,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means on the contrary we uphold the law
5071,ROM,4,NRSV,what then are we to say was gained by abraham our ancestor according to the flesh
5072,ROM,4,NRSV,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god
5073,ROM,4,NRSV,for what does the scripture say
5074,ROM,4,NRSV,abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness
5075,ROM,4,NRSV,now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due
5076,ROM,4,NRSV,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness
5077,ROM,4,NRSV,so also david speaks of the blessedness of those to whom god reckons righteousness apart from works blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the one against whom the lord will not reckon sin
5078,ROM,4,NRSV,is this blessedness then pronounced only on the circumcised or also on the uncircumcised
5079,ROM,4,NRSV,we say faith was reckoned to abraham as righteousness
5080,ROM,4,NRSV,how then was it reckoned to him
5081,ROM,4,NRSV,was it before or after he had been circumcised
5082,ROM,4,NRSV,it was not after but before he was circumcised
5083,ROM,4,NRSV,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised
5084,ROM,4,NRSV,the purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor abraham had before he was circumcised
5085,ROM,4,NRSV,for the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith
5086,ROM,4,NRSV,if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void
5087,ROM,4,NRSV,for the law brings wrath but where there is no law neither is there violation
5088,ROM,4,NRSV,for this reason it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of abraham for he is the father of all of us as it is written i have made you the father of many nationsin the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist
5089,ROM,4,NRSV,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be
5090,ROM,4,NRSV,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb
5091,ROM,4,NRSV,no distrust made him waver concerning the promise of god but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to god being fully convinced that god was able to do what he had promised
5092,ROM,4,NRSV,therefore his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness
5093,ROM,4,NRSV,now the words it was reckoned to him were written not for his sake alone but for ours also
5094,ROM,4,NRSV,it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification
5095,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god
5096,ROM,5,NRSV,and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us
5097,ROM,5,NRSV,for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly
5098,ROM,5,NRSV,indeed rarely will anyone die for a righteous personthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die
5099,ROM,5,NRSV,but god proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners christ died for us
5100,ROM,5,NRSV,much more surely then now that we have been justified by his blood will we be saved through him from the wrath of god
5101,ROM,5,NRSV,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life
5102,ROM,5,NRSV,but more than that we even boast in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation
5103,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and death came through sin and so death spread to all because all have sinned sin was indeed in the world before the law but sin is not reckoned when there is no law
5104,ROM,5,NRSV,yet death exercised dominion from adam to moses even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of adam who is a type of the one who was to come
5105,ROM,5,NRSV,but the free gift is not like the trespass
5106,ROM,5,NRSV,for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many
5107,ROM,5,NRSV,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin
5108,ROM,5,NRSV,for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification
5109,ROM,5,NRSV,if because of the one mans trespass death exercised dominion through that one much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man jesus christ
5110,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all
5111,ROM,5,NRSV,for just as by the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one mans obedience the many will be made righteous
5112,ROM,5,NRSV,but law came in with the result that the trespass multiplied but where sin increased grace abounded all the more so that just as sin exercised dominion in death so grace might also exercise dominion through justification leading to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5113,ROM,6,NRSV,what then are we to say
5114,ROM,6,NRSV,should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound
5115,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it
5116,ROM,6,NRSV,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death
5117,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life
5118,ROM,6,NRSV,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his
5119,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed and we might no longer be enslaved to sin
5120,ROM,6,NRSV,for whoever has died is freed from sin
5121,ROM,6,NRSV,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him
5122,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him
5123,ROM,6,NRSV,the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god
5124,ROM,6,NRSV,so you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to god in christ jesus
5125,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies to make you obey their passions
5126,ROM,6,NRSV,no longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness but present yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and present your members to god as instruments of righteousness
5127,ROM,6,NRSV,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace
5128,ROM,6,NRSV,what then
5129,ROM,6,NRSV,should we sin because we are not under law but under grace
5130,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness
5131,ROM,6,NRSV,but thanks be to god that you having once been slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted and that you having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness
5132,ROM,6,NRSV,i am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations
5133,ROM,6,NRSV,for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification
5134,ROM,6,NRSV,when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness
5135,ROM,6,NRSV,so what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed
5136,ROM,6,NRSV,the end of those things is death
5137,ROM,6,NRSV,but now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to god the advantage you get is sanctification
5138,ROM,6,NRSV,the end is eternal life
5139,ROM,6,NRSV,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
5140,ROM,7,NRSV,do you not know brothers and sisters for i am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only during that persons lifetime
5141,ROM,7,NRSV,thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband
5142,ROM,7,NRSV,accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive
5143,ROM,7,NRSV,but if her husband dies she is free from that law and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress
5144,ROM,7,NRSV,in the same way my friends you have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god
5145,ROM,7,NRSV,while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death
5146,ROM,7,NRSV,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit
5147,ROM,7,NRSV,what then should we say
5148,ROM,7,NRSV,that the law is sin
5149,ROM,7,NRSV,by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin
5150,ROM,7,NRSV,i would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet
5151,ROM,7,NRSV,but sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness
5152,ROM,7,NRSV,apart from the law sin lies dead
5153,ROM,7,NRSV,i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me
5154,ROM,7,NRSV,for sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment deceived me and through it killed me
5155,ROM,7,NRSV,so the law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good
5156,ROM,7,NRSV,did what is good then bring death to me
5157,ROM,7,NRSV,by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure
5158,ROM,7,NRSV,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold into slavery under sin
5159,ROM,7,NRSV,i do not understand my own actions
5160,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do what i want but i do the very thing i hate
5161,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good
5162,ROM,7,NRSV,but in fact it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me
5163,ROM,7,NRSV,for i know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh
5164,ROM,7,NRSV,i can will what is right but i cannot do it
5165,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do the good i want but the evil i do not want is what i do
5166,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me
5167,ROM,7,NRSV,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand
5168,ROM,7,NRSV,for i delight in the law of god in my inmost self but i see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members
5169,ROM,7,NRSV,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death
5170,ROM,7,NRSV,thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then with my mind i am a slave to the law of god but with my flesh i am a slave to the law of sin
5171,ROM,8,NRSV,there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
5172,ROM,8,NRSV,for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death
5173,ROM,8,NRSV,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin he condemned sin in the flesh so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit
5174,ROM,8,NRSV,for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit
5175,ROM,8,NRSV,to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace
5176,ROM,8,NRSV,for this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods lawindeed it cannot and those who are in the flesh cannot please god
5177,ROM,8,NRSV,but you are not in the flesh you are in the spirit since the spirit of god dwells in you
5178,ROM,8,NRSV,anyone who does not have the spirit of christ does not belong to him
5179,ROM,8,NRSV,but if christ is in you though the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness
5180,ROM,8,NRSV,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit that dwells in you
5181,ROM,8,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live
5182,ROM,8,NRSV,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god
5183,ROM,8,NRSV,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption
5184,ROM,8,NRSV,when we cry abba father it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him
5185,ROM,8,NRSV,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us
5186,ROM,8,NRSV,for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god
5187,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies
5188,ROM,8,NRSV,for in hope we were saved
5189,ROM,8,NRSV,now hope that is seen is not hope
5190,ROM,8,NRSV,for who hopes for what is seen
5191,ROM,8,NRSV,but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience
5192,ROM,8,NRSV,likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but that very spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words
5193,ROM,8,NRSV,and god who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god
5194,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that all things work together for good for those who love god who are called according to his purpose
5195,ROM,8,NRSV,for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family
5196,ROM,8,NRSV,and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified
5197,ROM,8,NRSV,what then are we to say about these things
5198,ROM,8,NRSV,if god is for us who is against us
5199,ROM,8,NRSV,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else
5200,ROM,8,NRSV,who will bring any charge against gods elect
5201,ROM,8,NRSV,it is god who justifies
5202,ROM,8,NRSV,who is to condemn
5203,ROM,8,NRSV,it is christ jesus who died yes who was raised who is at the right hand of god who indeed intercedes for us
5204,ROM,8,NRSV,who will separate us from the love of christ
5205,ROM,8,NRSV,will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
5206,ROM,8,NRSV,as it is written for your sake we are being killed all day long we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered
5207,ROM,8,NRSV,no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us
5208,ROM,8,NRSV,for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord
5209,ROM,9,NRSV,i am speaking the truth in christi am not lying my conscience confirms it by the holy spirit i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart
5210,ROM,9,NRSV,for i could wish that i myself were accursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my own people my kindred according to the flesh
5211,ROM,9,NRSV,they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah who is over all god blessed forever
5212,ROM,9,NRSV,amen
5213,ROM,9,NRSV,it is not as though the word of god had failed
5214,ROM,9,NRSV,for not all israelites truly belong to israel and not all of abrahams children are his true descendants but it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you
5215,ROM,9,NRSV,this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of god but the children of the promise are counted as descendants
5216,ROM,9,NRSV,for this is what the promise said about this time i will return and sarah shall have a son
5217,ROM,9,NRSV,nor is that all something similar happened to rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband our ancestor isaac
5218,ROM,9,NRSV,even before they had been born or had done anything good or bad so that gods purpose of election might continue not by works but by his call she was told the elder shall serve the younger
5219,ROM,9,NRSV,as it is written i have loved jacob but i have hated esau
5220,ROM,9,NRSV,what then are we to say
5221,ROM,9,NRSV,is there injustice on gods part
5222,ROM,9,NRSV,by no means for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
5223,ROM,9,NRSV,so it depends not on human will or exertion but on god who shows mercy
5224,ROM,9,NRSV,for the scripture says to pharaoh i have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth
5225,ROM,9,NRSV,so then he has mercy on whomever he chooses and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses
5226,ROM,9,NRSV,you will say to me then why then does he still find fault
5227,ROM,9,NRSV,for who can resist his will
5228,ROM,9,NRSV,but who indeed are you a human being to argue with god
5229,ROM,9,NRSV,will what is molded say to the one who molds it why have you made me like this
5230,ROM,9,NRSV,has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use
5231,ROM,9,NRSV,what if god desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy which he has prepared beforehand for glory including us whom he has called not from the jews only but also from the gentiles
5232,ROM,9,NRSV,as indeed he says in hosea those who were not my people i will call my people and her who was not beloved i will call beloved
5233,ROM,9,NRSV,and in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people there they shall be called children of the living god
5234,ROM,9,NRSV,and isaiah cries out concerning israel though the number of the children of israel were like the sand of the sea only a remnant of them will be saved for the lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively
5235,ROM,9,NRSV,and as isaiah predicted if the lord of hosts had not left survivors to us we would have fared like sodom and been made like gomorrah
5236,ROM,9,NRSV,what then are we to say
5237,ROM,9,NRSV,gentiles who did not strive for righteousness have attained it that is righteousness through faith but israel who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law did not succeed in fulfilling that law
5238,ROM,9,NRSV,why not
5239,ROM,9,NRSV,because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith but as if it were based on works
5240,ROM,9,NRSV,they have stumbled over the stumbling stone as it is written see i am laying in zion a stone that will make people stumble a rock that will make them fall and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame
5241,ROM,10,NRSV,brothers and sisters my hearts desire and prayer to god for them is that they may be saved
5242,ROM,10,NRSV,i can testify that they have a zeal for god but it is not enlightened
5243,ROM,10,NRSV,for being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from god and seeking to establish their own they have not submitted to gods righteousness
5244,ROM,10,NRSV,for christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes
5245,ROM,10,NRSV,moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law that the person who does these things will live by them
5246,ROM,10,NRSV,but the righteousness that comes from faith says do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven
5247,ROM,10,NRSV,that is to bring christ down or who will descend into the abyss
5248,ROM,10,NRSV,that is to bring christ up from the dead
5249,ROM,10,NRSV,but what does it say
5250,ROM,10,NRSV,the word is near you on your lips and in your heart that is the word of faith that we proclaim because if you confess with your lips that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
5251,ROM,10,NRSV,for one believes with the heart and so is justified and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved
5252,ROM,10,NRSV,the scripture says no one who believes in him will be put to shame
5253,ROM,10,NRSV,for there is no distinction between jew and greek the same lord is lord of all and is generous to all who call on him
5254,ROM,10,NRSV,for everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
5255,ROM,10,NRSV,but how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed
5256,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard
5257,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him
5258,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent
5259,ROM,10,NRSV,as it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news but not all have obeyed the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message
5260,ROM,10,NRSV,so faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes through the word of christ
5261,ROM,10,NRSV,but i ask have they not heard
5262,ROM,10,NRSV,indeed they have for their voice has gone out to all the earth and their words to the ends of the world
5263,ROM,10,NRSV,again i ask did israel not understand
5264,ROM,10,NRSV,first moses says i will make you jealous of those who are not a nation with a foolish nation i will make you angry
5265,ROM,10,NRSV,then isaiah is so bold as to say i have been found by those who did not seek me i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me
5266,ROM,10,NRSV,but of israel he says all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people
5267,ROM,11,NRSV,i ask then has god rejected his people
5268,ROM,11,NRSV,by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin
5269,ROM,11,NRSV,god has not rejected his people whom he foreknew
5270,ROM,11,NRSV,do you not know what the scripture says of elijah how he pleads with god against israel
5271,ROM,11,NRSV,lord they have killed your prophets they have demolished your altars i alone am left and they are seeking my life
5272,ROM,11,NRSV,but what is the divine reply to him
5273,ROM,11,NRSV,i have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal
5274,ROM,11,NRSV,so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace
5275,ROM,11,NRSV,but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace
5276,ROM,11,NRSV,what then
5277,ROM,11,NRSV,israel failed to obtain what it was seeking
5278,ROM,11,NRSV,the elect obtained it but the rest were hardened as it is written god gave them a sluggish spirit eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear down to this very day
5279,ROM,11,NRSV,and david says let their table become a snare and a trap a stumbling block and a retribution for them let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see and keep their backs forever bent
5280,ROM,11,NRSV,so i ask have they stumbled so as to fall
5281,ROM,11,NRSV,by no means but through their stumbling salvation has come to the gentiles so as to make israel jealous
5282,ROM,11,NRSV,now if their stumbling means riches for the world and if their defeat means riches for gentiles how much more will their full inclusion mean now i am speaking to you gentiles
5283,ROM,11,NRSV,inasmuch then as i am an apostle to the gentiles i glorify my ministry in order to make my own people jealous and thus save some of them
5284,ROM,11,NRSV,for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead if the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy then the whole batch is holy and if the root is holy then the branches also are holy
5285,ROM,11,NRSV,but if some of the branches were broken off and you a wild olive shoot were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree do not boast over the branches
5286,ROM,11,NRSV,if you do boast remember that it is not you that support the root but the root that supports you
5287,ROM,11,NRSV,you will say branches were broken off so that i might be grafted in
5288,ROM,11,NRSV,that is true
5289,ROM,11,NRSV,they were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand only through faith
5290,ROM,11,NRSV,so do not become proud but stand in awe
5291,ROM,11,NRSV,for if god did not spare the natural branches perhaps he will not spare you
5292,ROM,11,NRSV,note then the kindness and the severity of god severity toward those who have fallen but gods kindness toward you provided you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off
5293,ROM,11,NRSV,and even those of israel if they do not persist in unbelief will be grafted in for god has the power to graft them in again
5294,ROM,11,NRSV,for if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree
5295,ROM,11,NRSV,so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters i want you to understand this mystery a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of the gentiles has come in
5296,ROM,11,NRSV,and so all israel will be saved as it is written out of zion will come the deliverer he will banish ungodliness from jacob
5297,ROM,11,NRSV,and this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins
5298,ROM,11,NRSV,as regards the gospel they are enemies of god for your sake but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their ancestors for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable
5299,ROM,11,NRSV,just as you were once disobedient to god but have now received mercy because of their disobedience so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they too may now receive mercy
5300,ROM,11,NRSV,for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all
5301,ROM,11,NRSV,o the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways for who has known the mind of the lord
5302,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has been his counselor
5303,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has given a gift to him to receive a gift in return
5304,ROM,11,NRSV,for from him and through him and to him are all things
5305,ROM,11,NRSV,to him be the glory forever
5306,ROM,11,NRSV,amen
5307,ROM,12,NRSV,i appeal to you therefore brothers and sisters by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual worship
5308,ROM,12,NRSV,do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of godwhat is good and acceptable and perfect
5309,ROM,12,NRSV,for by the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has assigned
5310,ROM,12,NRSV,for as in one body we have many members and not all the members have the same function so we who are many are one body in christ and individually we are members one of another
5311,ROM,12,NRSV,we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness
5312,ROM,12,NRSV,let love be genuine hate what is evil hold fast to what is good love one another with mutual affection outdo one another in showing honor
5313,ROM,12,NRSV,do not lag in zeal be ardent in spirit serve the lord
5314,ROM,12,NRSV,rejoice in hope be patient in suffering persevere in prayer
5315,ROM,12,NRSV,contribute to the needs of the saints extend hospitality to strangers
5316,ROM,12,NRSV,bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse them
5317,ROM,12,NRSV,rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep
5318,ROM,12,NRSV,live in harmony with one another do not be haughty but associate with the lowly do not claim to be wiser than you are
5319,ROM,12,NRSV,do not repay anyone evil for evil but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all
5320,ROM,12,NRSV,if it is possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with all
5321,ROM,12,NRSV,beloved never avenge yourselves but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord
5322,ROM,12,NRSV,no if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads
5323,ROM,12,NRSV,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
5324,ROM,13,NRSV,let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those authorities that exist have been instituted by god
5325,ROM,13,NRSV,therefore whoever resists authority resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment
5326,ROM,13,NRSV,for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad
5327,ROM,13,NRSV,do you wish to have no fear of the authority
5328,ROM,13,NRSV,then do what is good and you will receive its approval for it is gods servant for your good
5329,ROM,13,NRSV,but if you do what is wrong you should be afraid for the authority does not bear the sword in vain it is the servant of god to execute wrath on the wrongdoer
5330,ROM,13,NRSV,therefore one must be subject not only because of wrath but also because of conscience
5331,ROM,13,NRSV,for the same reason you also pay taxes for the authorities are gods servants busy with this very thing
5332,ROM,13,NRSV,pay to all what is due themtaxes to whom taxes are due revenue to whom revenue is due respect to whom respect is due honor to whom honor is due
5333,ROM,13,NRSV,owe no one anything except to love one another for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law
5334,ROM,13,NRSV,the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word love your neighbor as yourself
5335,ROM,13,NRSV,love does no wrong to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
5336,ROM,13,NRSV,besides this you know what time it is how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep
5337,ROM,13,NRSV,for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers the night is far gone the day is near
5338,ROM,13,NRSV,let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light let us live honorably as in the day not in reveling and drunkenness not in debauchery and licentiousness not in quarreling and jealousy
5339,ROM,13,NRSV,instead put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires
5340,ROM,14,NRSV,welcome those who are weak in faith but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions
5341,ROM,14,NRSV,some believe in eating anything while the weak eat only vegetables
5342,ROM,14,NRSV,those who eat must not despise those who abstain and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat for god has welcomed them
5343,ROM,14,NRSV,who are you to pass judgment on servants of another
5344,ROM,14,NRSV,it is before their own lord that they stand or fall
5345,ROM,14,NRSV,and they will be upheld for the lord is able to make them stand
5346,ROM,14,NRSV,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike
5347,ROM,14,NRSV,let all be fully convinced in their own minds
5348,ROM,14,NRSV,those who observe the day observe it in honor of the lord
5349,ROM,14,NRSV,also those who eat eat in honor of the lord since they give thanks to god while those who abstain abstain in honor of the lord and give thanks to god
5350,ROM,14,NRSV,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves
5351,ROM,14,NRSV,if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords
5352,ROM,14,NRSV,for to this end christ died and lived again so that he might be lord of both the dead and the living
5353,ROM,14,NRSV,why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister
5354,ROM,14,NRSV,or you why do you despise your brother or sister
5355,ROM,14,NRSV,for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god
5356,ROM,14,NRSV,for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god
5357,ROM,14,NRSV,so then each of us will be accountable to god
5358,ROM,14,NRSV,let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another but resolve instead never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of another
5359,ROM,14,NRSV,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean
5360,ROM,14,NRSV,if your brother or sister is being injured by what you eat you are no longer walking in love
5361,ROM,14,NRSV,do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom christ died
5362,ROM,14,NRSV,so do not let your good be spoken of as evil
5363,ROM,14,NRSV,for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
5364,ROM,14,NRSV,the one who thus serves christ is acceptable to god and has human approval
5365,ROM,14,NRSV,let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding
5366,ROM,14,NRSV,do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god
5367,ROM,14,NRSV,everything is indeed clean but it is wrong for you to make others fall by what you eat it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother or sister stumble
5368,ROM,14,NRSV,the faith that you have have as your own conviction before god
5369,ROM,14,NRSV,blessed are those who have no reason to condemn themselves because of what they approve
5370,ROM,14,NRSV,but those who have doubts are condemned if they eat because they do not act from faith for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin
5371,ROM,15,NRSV,we who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves
5372,ROM,15,NRSV,each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor
5373,ROM,15,NRSV,for christ did not please himself but as it is written the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me
5374,ROM,15,NRSV,for whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope
5375,ROM,15,NRSV,may the god of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another in accordance with christ jesus so that together you may with one voice glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ
5376,ROM,15,NRSV,welcome one another therefore just as christ has welcomed you for the glory of god
5377,ROM,15,NRSV,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy
5378,ROM,15,NRSV,as it is written therefore i will confess you among the gentiles and sing praises to your name and again he says rejoice o gentiles with his people and again praise the lord all you gentiles and let all the peoples praise him and again isaiah says the root of jesse shall come the one who rises to rule the gentiles in him the gentiles shall hope
5379,ROM,15,NRSV,may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy spirit
5380,ROM,15,NRSV,i myself feel confident about you my brothers and sisters that you yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another
5381,ROM,15,NRSV,nevertheless on some points i have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder because of the grace given me by god to be a minister of christ jesus to the gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of god so that the offering of the gentiles may be acceptable sanctified by the holy spirit
5382,ROM,15,NRSV,in christ jesus then i have reason to boast of my work for god
5383,ROM,15,NRSV,for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the gentiles by word and deed by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and as far around as illyricum i have fully proclaimed the good news of christ
5384,ROM,15,NRSV,thus i make it my ambition to proclaim the good news not where christ has already been named so that i do not build on someone elses foundation but as it is written those who have never been told of him shall see and those who have never heard of him shall understand
5385,ROM,15,NRSV,this is the reason that i have so often been hindered from coming to you
5386,ROM,15,NRSV,but now with no further place for me in these regions i desire as i have for many years to come to you when i go to spain
5387,ROM,15,NRSV,for i do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you once i have enjoyed your company for a little while
5388,ROM,15,NRSV,at present however i am going to jerusalem in a ministry to the saints for macedonia and achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at jerusalem
5389,ROM,15,NRSV,they were pleased to do this and indeed they owe it to them for if the gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings they ought also to be of service to them in material things
5390,ROM,15,NRSV,so when i have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected i will set out by way of you to spain and i know that when i come to you i will come in the fullness of the blessing of christ

5419,ROM,16,NRSV,i tertius the writer of this letter greet you in the lord
5420,ROM,16,NRSV,gaius who is host to me and to the whole church greets you
5421,ROM,16,NRSV,erastus the city treasurer and our brother quartus greet you
5422,ROM,16,NRSV,now to god who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages but is now disclosed and through the prophetic writings is made known to all the gentiles according to the command of the eternal god to bring about the obedience of faith to the only wise god through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever amen
5423,1CO,1,NRSV,paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and our brother sosthenes to the church of god that is in corinth to those who are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our lord jesus christ both their lord and ours grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
5424,1CO,1,NRSV,i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind just as the testimony of christ has been strengthened among you so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ
5425,1CO,1,NRSV,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ
5426,1CO,1,NRSV,god is faithful by him you were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord
5427,1CO,1,NRSV,now i appeal to you brothers and sisters by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose
5428,1CO,1,NRSV,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters
5429,1CO,1,NRSV,what i mean is that each of you says i belong to paul or i belong to apollos or i belong to cephas or i belong to christ
5430,1CO,1,NRSV,has christ been divided
5431,1CO,1,NRSV,was paul crucified for you
5432,1CO,1,NRSV,or were you baptized in the name of paul
5433,1CO,1,NRSV,i thank god that i baptized none of you except crispus and gaius so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name
5434,1CO,1,NRSV,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power
5435,1CO,1,NRSV,for the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
5436,1CO,1,NRSV,for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart
5437,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the one who is wise
5438,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the scribe
5439,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the debater of this age
5440,1CO,1,NRSV,has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world
5441,1CO,1,NRSV,for since in the wisdom of god the world did not know god through wisdom god decided through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe
5442,1CO,1,NRSV,for jews demand signs and greeks desire wisdom but we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles but to those who are the called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
5443,1CO,1,NRSV,for gods foolishness is wiser than human wisdom and gods weakness is stronger than human strength
5444,1CO,1,NRSV,consider your own call brothers and sisters not many of you were wise by human standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth
5445,1CO,1,NRSV,but god chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise god chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong god chose what is low and despised in the world things that are not to reduce to nothing things that are so that no one might boast in the presence of god
5446,1CO,1,NRSV,he is the source of your life in christ jesus who became for us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption in order that as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lord
5447,1CO,2,NRSV,when i came to you brothers and sisters i did not come proclaiming the mystery of god to you in lofty words or wisdom
5448,1CO,2,NRSV,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified
5449,1CO,2,NRSV,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling
5450,1CO,2,NRSV,my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of god
5451,1CO,2,NRSV,yet among the mature we do speak wisdom though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are doomed to perish
5452,1CO,2,NRSV,but we speak gods wisdom secret and hidden which god decreed before the ages for our glory
5453,1CO,2,NRSV,none of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory
5454,1CO,2,NRSV,but as it is written what no eye has seen nor ear heard nor the human heart conceived what god has prepared for those who love him these things god has revealed to us through the spirit for the spirit searches everything even the depths of god
5455,1CO,2,NRSV,for what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within
5456,1CO,2,NRSV,so also no one comprehends what is truly gods except the spirit of god
5457,1CO,2,NRSV,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is from god so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by god
5458,1CO,2,NRSV,and we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the spirit interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual
5459,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of gods spirit for they are foolishness to them and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned
5460,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are spiritual discern all things and they are themselves subject to no one elses scrutiny
5461,1CO,2,NRSV,for who has known the mind of the lord so as to instruct him
5462,1CO,2,NRSV,but we have the mind of christ
5463,1CO,3,NRSV,and so brothers and sisters i could not speak to you as spiritual people but rather as people of the flesh as infants in christ
5464,1CO,3,NRSV,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food
5465,1CO,3,NRSV,even now you are still not ready for you are still of the flesh
5466,1CO,3,NRSV,for as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not of the flesh and behaving according to human inclinations
5467,1CO,3,NRSV,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human
5468,1CO,3,NRSV,what then is apollos
5469,1CO,3,NRSV,what is paul
5470,1CO,3,NRSV,servants through whom you came to believe as the lord assigned to each
5471,1CO,3,NRSV,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth
5472,1CO,3,NRSV,so neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything but only god who gives the growth
5473,1CO,3,NRSV,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each
5474,1CO,3,NRSV,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building
5475,1CO,3,NRSV,according to the grace of god given to me like a skilled master builder i laid a foundation and someone else is building on it
5476,1CO,3,NRSV,each builder must choose with care how to build on it
5477,1CO,3,NRSV,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ
5478,1CO,3,NRSV,now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw the work of each builder will become visible for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test what sort of work each has done
5479,1CO,3,NRSV,if what has been built on the foundation survives the builder will receive a reward
5480,1CO,3,NRSV,if the work is burned up the builder will suffer loss the builder will be saved but only as through fire
5481,1CO,3,NRSV,do you not know that you are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells in you
5482,1CO,3,NRSV,if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person
5483,1CO,3,NRSV,for gods temple is holy and you are that temple
5484,1CO,3,NRSV,do not deceive yourselves
5485,1CO,3,NRSV,if you think that you are wise in this age you should become fools so that you may become wise
5486,1CO,3,NRSV,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god
5487,1CO,3,NRSV,for it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile
5488,1CO,3,NRSV,so let no one boast about human leaders
5489,1CO,3,NRSV,for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the futureall belong to you and you belong to christ and christ belongs to god
5490,1CO,4,NRSV,think of us in this way as servants of christ and stewards of gods mysteries
5491,1CO,4,NRSV,moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy
5492,1CO,4,NRSV,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court
5493,1CO,4,NRSV,i do not even judge myself
5494,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not aware of anything against myself but i am not thereby acquitted
5495,1CO,4,NRSV,it is the lord who judges me
5496,1CO,4,NRSV,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart
5497,1CO,4,NRSV,then each one will receive commendation from god
5498,1CO,4,NRSV,i have applied all this to apollos and myself for your benefit brothers and sisters so that you may learn through us the meaning of the saying nothing beyond what is written so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another
5499,1CO,4,NRSV,for who sees anything different in you
5500,1CO,4,NRSV,what do you have that you did not receive
5501,1CO,4,NRSV,and if you received it why do you boast as if it were not a gift
5502,1CO,4,NRSV,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals
5503,1CO,4,NRSV,we are fools for the sake of christ but you are wise in christ
5504,1CO,4,NRSV,we are weak but you are strong
5505,1CO,4,NRSV,you are held in honor but we in disrepute
5506,1CO,4,NRSV,to the present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless and we grow weary from the work of our own hands
5507,1CO,4,NRSV,when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure when slandered we speak kindly
5508,1CO,4,NRSV,we have become like the rubbish of the world the dregs of all things to this very day
5509,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not writing this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children
5510,1CO,4,NRSV,for though you might have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers
5511,1CO,4,NRSV,indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel
5512,1CO,4,NRSV,i appeal to you then be imitators of me
5513,1CO,4,NRSV,for this reason i sent you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church
5514,1CO,4,NRSV,but some of you thinking that i am not coming to you have become arrogant
5515,1CO,4,NRSV,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power
5516,1CO,4,NRSV,for the kingdom of god depends not on talk but on power
5517,1CO,4,NRSV,what would you prefer
5518,1CO,4,NRSV,am i to come to you with a stick or with love in a spirit of gentleness
5519,1CO,5,NRSV,it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that is not found even among pagans for a man is living with his fathers wife
5520,1CO,5,NRSV,and you are arrogant should you not rather have mourned so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you
5521,1CO,5,NRSV,for though absent in body i am present in spirit and as if present i have already pronounced judgment in the name of the lord jesus on the man who has done such a thing
5522,1CO,5,NRSV,when you are assembled and my spirit is present with the power of our lord jesus you are to hand this man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the lord
5523,1CO,5,NRSV,your boasting is not a good thing
5524,1CO,5,NRSV,do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough
5525,1CO,5,NRSV,clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch as you really are unleavened
5526,1CO,5,NRSV,for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed
5527,1CO,5,NRSV,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
5528,1CO,5,NRSV,i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral persons not at all meaning the immoral of this world or the greedy and robbers or idolaters since you would then need to go out of the world
5529,1CO,5,NRSV,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber
5530,1CO,5,NRSV,do not even eat with such a one
5531,1CO,5,NRSV,for what have i to do with judging those outside
5532,1CO,5,NRSV,is it not those who are inside that you are to judge
5533,1CO,5,NRSV,god will judge those outside
5534,1CO,5,NRSV,drive out the wicked person from among you
5535,1CO,6,NRSV,when any of you has a grievance against another do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it before the saints
5536,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that the saints will judge the world
5537,1CO,6,NRSV,and if the world is to be judged by you are you incompetent to try trivial cases
5538,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that we are to judge angelsto say nothing of ordinary matters
5539,1CO,6,NRSV,if you have ordinary cases then do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church
5540,1CO,6,NRSV,i say this to your shame
5541,1CO,6,NRSV,can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer and another but a believer goes to court against a believer and before unbelievers at that
5542,1CO,6,NRSV,in fact to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you
5543,1CO,6,NRSV,why not rather be wronged
5544,1CO,6,NRSV,why not rather be defrauded
5545,1CO,6,NRSV,but you yourselves wrong and defraudand believers at that
5546,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god
5547,1CO,6,NRSV,do not be deceived fornicators idolaters adulterers male prostitutes sodomites thieves the greedy drunkards revilers robbersnone of these will inherit the kingdom of god
5548,1CO,6,NRSV,and this is what some of you used to be
5549,1CO,6,NRSV,but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god
5550,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but not all things are beneficial
5551,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but i will not be dominated by anything
5552,1CO,6,NRSV,food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food and god will destroy both one and the other
5553,1CO,6,NRSV,the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body
5554,1CO,6,NRSV,and god raised the lord and will also raise us by his power
5555,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that your bodies are members of christ
5556,1CO,6,NRSV,should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute
5557,1CO,6,NRSV,never do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her
5558,1CO,6,NRSV,for it is said the two shall be one flesh
5559,1CO,6,NRSV,but anyone united to the lord becomes one spirit with him
5560,1CO,6,NRSV,shun fornication every sin that a person commits is outside the body but the fornicator sins against the body itself
5561,1CO,6,NRSV,or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from god and that you are not your own
5562,1CO,6,NRSV,for you were bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body
5563,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning the matters about which you wrote it is well for a man not to touch a woman
5564,1CO,7,NRSV,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband
5565,1CO,7,NRSV,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband
5566,1CO,7,NRSV,for the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does
5567,1CO,7,NRSV,do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer and then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol
5568,1CO,7,NRSV,this i say by way of concession not of command
5569,1CO,7,NRSV,i wish that all were as i myself am
5570,1CO,7,NRSV,but each has a particular gift from god one having one kind and another a different kind
5571,1CO,7,NRSV,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am
5572,1CO,7,NRSV,but if they are not practicing selfcontrol they should marry
5573,1CO,7,NRSV,for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion
5574,1CO,7,NRSV,to the married i give this commandnot i but the lordthat the wife should not separate from her husband but if she does separate let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and that the husband should not divorce his wife
5575,1CO,7,NRSV,to the rest i sayi and not the lordthat if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her
5576,1CO,7,NRSV,and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her she should not divorce him
5577,1CO,7,NRSV,for the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband
5578,1CO,7,NRSV,otherwise your children would be unclean but as it is they are holy
5579,1CO,7,NRSV,but if the unbelieving partner separates let it be so in such a case the brother or sister is not bound
5580,1CO,7,NRSV,it is to peace that god has called you
5581,1CO,7,NRSV,wife for all you know you might save your husband
5582,1CO,7,NRSV,husband for all you know you might save your wife
5583,1CO,7,NRSV,however that may be let each of you lead the life that the lord has assigned to which god called you
5584,1CO,7,NRSV,this is my rule in all the churches
5585,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised
5586,1CO,7,NRSV,let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision
5587,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised
5588,1CO,7,NRSV,let him not seek circumcision
5589,1CO,7,NRSV,circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but obeying the commandments of god is everything
5590,1CO,7,NRSV,let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called
5591,1CO,7,NRSV,were you a slave when called
5592,1CO,7,NRSV,do not be concerned about it
5593,1CO,7,NRSV,even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever
5594,1CO,7,NRSV,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ
5595,1CO,7,NRSV,you were bought with a price do not become slaves of human masters
5596,1CO,7,NRSV,in whatever condition you were called brothers and sisters there remain with god
5597,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning virgins i have no command of the lord but i give my opinion as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy
5598,1CO,7,NRSV,i think that in view of the impending crisis it is well for you to remain as you are
5599,1CO,7,NRSV,are you bound to a wife
5600,1CO,7,NRSV,do not seek to be free
5601,1CO,7,NRSV,are you free from a wife
5602,1CO,7,NRSV,do not seek a wife
5603,1CO,7,NRSV,but if you marry you do not sin and if a virgin marries she does not sin
5604,1CO,7,NRSV,yet those who marry will experience distress in this life and i would spare you that
5605,1CO,7,NRSV,i mean brothers and sisters the appointed time has grown short from now on let even those who have wives be as though they had none and those who mourn as though they were not mourning and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they had no possessions and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it
5606,1CO,7,NRSV,for the present form of this world is passing away
5607,1CO,7,NRSV,i want you to be free from anxieties
5608,1CO,7,NRSV,the unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the lord how to please the lord but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please his wife and his interests are divided
5609,1CO,7,NRSV,and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband
5610,1CO,7,NRSV,i say this for your own benefit not to put any restraint upon you but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the lord
5611,1CO,7,NRSV,if anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancee if his passions are strong and so it has to be let him marry as he wishes it is no sin
5612,1CO,7,NRSV,let them marry
5613,1CO,7,NRSV,but if someone stands firm in his resolve being under no necessity but having his own desire under control and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee he will do well
5614,1CO,7,NRSV,so then he who marries his fiancee does well and he who refrains from marriage will do better
5615,1CO,7,NRSV,a wife is bound as long as her husband lives
5616,1CO,7,NRSV,but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes only in the lord
5617,1CO,7,NRSV,but in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is
5618,1CO,7,NRSV,and i think that i too have the spirit of god
5619,1CO,8,NRSV,now concerning food sacrificed to idols we know that all of us possess knowledge
5620,1CO,8,NRSV,knowledge puffs up but love builds up
5621,1CO,8,NRSV,anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge but anyone who loves god is known by him
5622,1CO,8,NRSV,hence as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that no idol in the world really exists and that there is no god but one
5623,1CO,8,NRSV,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist
5624,1CO,8,NRSV,it is not everyone however who has this knowledge
5625,1CO,8,NRSV,since some have become so accustomed to idols until now they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
5626,1CO,8,NRSV,food will not bring us close to god
5627,1CO,8,NRSV,we are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do
5628,1CO,8,NRSV,but take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak
5629,1CO,8,NRSV,for if others see you who possess knowledge eating in the temple of an idol might they not since their conscience is weak be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols
5630,1CO,8,NRSV,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed
5631,1CO,8,NRSV,but when you thus sin against members of your family and wound their conscience when it is weak you sin against christ
5632,1CO,8,NRSV,therefore if food is a cause of their falling i will never eat meat so that i may not cause one of them to fall
5633,1CO,9,NRSV,am i not free
5634,1CO,9,NRSV,am i not an apostle
5635,1CO,9,NRSV,have i not seen jesus our lord
5636,1CO,9,NRSV,are you not my work in the lord
5637,1CO,9,NRSV,if i am not an apostle to others at least i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord
5638,1CO,9,NRSV,this is my defense to those who would examine me
5639,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to our food and drink
5640,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas
5641,1CO,9,NRSV,or is it only barnabas and i who have no right to refrain from working for a living
5642,1CO,9,NRSV,who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service
5643,1CO,9,NRSV,who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit
5644,1CO,9,NRSV,or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk
5645,1CO,9,NRSV,do i say this on human authority
5646,1CO,9,NRSV,does not the law also say the same
5647,1CO,9,NRSV,for it is written in the law of moses you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain
5648,1CO,9,NRSV,is it for oxen that god is concerned
5649,1CO,9,NRSV,or does he not speak entirely for our sake
5650,1CO,9,NRSV,it was indeed written for our sake for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop
5651,1CO,9,NRSV,if we have sown spiritual good among you is it too much if we reap your material benefits
5652,1CO,9,NRSV,if others share this rightful claim on you do not we still more
5653,1CO,9,NRSV,nevertheless we have not made use of this right but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of christ
5654,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar
5655,1CO,9,NRSV,in the same way the lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel
5656,1CO,9,NRSV,but i have made no use of any of these rights nor am i writing this so that they may be applied in my case
5657,1CO,9,NRSV,indeed i would rather die than thatno one will deprive me of my ground for boasting if i proclaim the gospel this gives me no ground for boasting for an obligation is laid on me and woe to me if i do not proclaim the gospel for if i do this of my own will i have a reward but if not of my own will i am entrusted with a commission
5658,1CO,9,NRSV,what then is my reward
5659,1CO,9,NRSV,just this that in my proclamation i may make the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel
5660,1CO,9,NRSV,for though i am free with respect to all i have made myself a slave to all so that i might win more of them
5661,1CO,9,NRSV,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews
5662,1CO,9,NRSV,to those under the law i became as one under the law though i myself am not under the law so that i might win those under the law
5663,1CO,9,NRSV,to those outside the law i became as one outside the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so that i might win those outside the law
5664,1CO,9,NRSV,to the weak i became weak so that i might win the weak
5665,1CO,9,NRSV,i have become all things to all people that i might by all means save some
5666,1CO,9,NRSV,i do it all for the sake of the gospel so that i may share in its blessings
5667,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that in a race the runners all compete but only one receives the prize
5668,1CO,9,NRSV,run in such a way that you may win it
5669,1CO,9,NRSV,athletes exercise selfcontrol in all things they do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an imperishable one
5670,1CO,9,NRSV,so i do not run aimlessly nor do i box as though beating the air but i punish my body and enslave it so that after proclaiming to others i myself should not be disqualified
5671,1CO,10,NRSV,i do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink
5672,1CO,10,NRSV,for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ
5673,1CO,10,NRSV,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness
5674,1CO,10,NRSV,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did
5675,1CO,10,NRSV,do not become idolaters as some of them did as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play
5676,1CO,10,NRSV,we must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did and twentythree thousand fell in a single day
5677,1CO,10,NRSV,we must not put christ to the test as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents
5678,1CO,10,NRSV,and do not complain as some of them did and were destroyed by the destroyer
5679,1CO,10,NRSV,these things happened to them to serve as an example and they were written down to instruct us on whom the ends of the ages have come
5680,1CO,10,NRSV,so if you think you are standing watch out that you do not fall
5681,1CO,10,NRSV,no testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone
5682,1CO,10,NRSV,god is faithful and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it
5683,1CO,10,NRSV,therefore my dear friends flee from the worship of idols
5684,1CO,10,NRSV,i speak as to sensible people judge for yourselves what i say
5685,1CO,10,NRSV,the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a sharing in the blood of christ
5686,1CO,10,NRSV,the bread that we break is it not a sharing in the body of christ
5687,1CO,10,NRSV,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread
5688,1CO,10,NRSV,consider the people of israel are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar
5689,1CO,10,NRSV,what do i imply then
5690,1CO,10,NRSV,that food sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything
5691,1CO,10,NRSV,no i imply that what pagans sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to god
5692,1CO,10,NRSV,i do not want you to be partners with demons
5693,1CO,10,NRSV,you cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons
5694,1CO,10,NRSV,you cannot partake of the table of the lord and the table of demons
5695,1CO,10,NRSV,or are we provoking the lord to jealousy
5696,1CO,10,NRSV,are we stronger than he
5697,1CO,10,NRSV,all things are lawful but not all things are beneficial
5698,1CO,10,NRSV,all things are lawful but not all things build up
5699,1CO,10,NRSV,do not seek your own advantage but that of the other
5700,1CO,10,NRSV,eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience for the earth and its fullness are the lords
5701,1CO,10,NRSV,if an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience
5702,1CO,10,NRSV,but if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it out of consideration for the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience i mean the others conscience not your own
5703,1CO,10,NRSV,for why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone elses conscience
5704,1CO,10,NRSV,if i partake with thankfulness why should i be denounced because of that for which i give thanks
5705,1CO,10,NRSV,so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do everything for the glory of god
5706,1CO,10,NRSV,give no offense to jews or to greeks or to the church of god just as i try to please everyone in everything i do not seeking my own advantage but that of many so that they may be saved
5707,1CO,11,NRSV,be imitators of me as i am of christ
5708,1CO,11,NRSV,i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you
5709,1CO,11,NRSV,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband is the head of his wife and god is the head of christ
5710,1CO,11,NRSV,any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head disgraces his head but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved
5711,1CO,11,NRSV,for if a woman will not veil herself then she should cut off her hair but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved she should wear a veil
5712,1CO,11,NRSV,for a man ought not to have his head veiled since he is the image and reflection of god but woman is the reflection of man
5713,1CO,11,NRSV,indeed man was not made from woman but woman from man
5714,1CO,11,NRSV,neither was man created for the sake of woman but woman for the sake of man
5715,1CO,11,NRSV,for this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels
5716,1CO,11,NRSV,nevertheless in the lord woman is not independent of man or man independent of woman
5717,1CO,11,NRSV,for just as woman came from man so man comes through woman but all things come from god
5718,1CO,11,NRSV,judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray to god with her head unveiled
5719,1CO,11,NRSV,does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is degrading to him but if a woman has long hair it is her glory
5720,1CO,11,NRSV,for her hair is given to her for a covering
5721,1CO,11,NRSV,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god
5722,1CO,11,NRSV,now in the following instructions i do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
5723,1CO,11,NRSV,for to begin with when you come together as a church i hear that there are divisions among you and to some extent i believe it
5724,1CO,11,NRSV,indeed there have to be factions among you for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine
5725,1CO,11,NRSV,when you come together it is not really to eat the lords supper
5726,1CO,11,NRSV,for when the time comes to eat each of you goes ahead with your own supper and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk
5727,1CO,11,NRSV,what do you not have homes to eat and drink in
5728,1CO,11,NRSV,or do you show contempt for the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing
5729,1CO,11,NRSV,what should i say to you
5730,1CO,11,NRSV,should i commend you
5731,1CO,11,NRSV,in this matter i do not commend you for i received from the lord what i also handed on to you that the lord jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body that is for you
5732,1CO,11,NRSV,do this in remembrance of me
5733,1CO,11,NRSV,in the same way he took the cup also after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood
5734,1CO,11,NRSV,do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
5735,1CO,11,NRSV,for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes
5736,1CO,11,NRSV,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord
5737,1CO,11,NRSV,examine yourselves and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup
5738,1CO,11,NRSV,for all who eat and drink without discerning the body eat and drink judgment against themselves
5739,1CO,11,NRSV,for this reason many of you are weak and ill and some have died
5740,1CO,11,NRSV,but if we judged ourselves we would not be judged
5741,1CO,11,NRSV,but when we are judged by the lord we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world
5742,1CO,11,NRSV,so then my brothers and sisters when you come together to eat wait for one another
5743,1CO,11,NRSV,if you are hungry eat at home so that when you come together it will not be for your condemnation
5744,1CO,11,NRSV,about the other things i will give instructions when i come
5745,1CO,12,NRSV,now concerning spiritual gifts brothers and sisters i do not want you to be uninformed
5746,1CO,12,NRSV,you know that when you were pagans you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak
5747,1CO,12,NRSV,therefore i want you to understand that no one speaking by the spirit of god ever says let jesus be cursed and no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit
5748,1CO,12,NRSV,now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of services but the same lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone
5749,1CO,12,NRSV,to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
5750,1CO,12,NRSV,to one is given through the spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the one spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another the discernment of spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues
5751,1CO,12,NRSV,all these are activated by one and the same spirit who allots to each one individually just as the spirit chooses
5752,1CO,12,NRSV,for just as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body though many are one body so it is with christ
5753,1CO,12,NRSV,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit
5754,1CO,12,NRSV,indeed the body does not consist of one member but of many
5755,1CO,12,NRSV,if the foot would say because i am not a hand i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body
5756,1CO,12,NRSV,and if the ear would say because i am not an eye i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body
5757,1CO,12,NRSV,if the whole body were an eye where would the hearing be
5758,1CO,12,NRSV,if the whole body were hearing where would the sense of smell be
5759,1CO,12,NRSV,but as it is god arranged the members in the body each one of them as he chose
5760,1CO,12,NRSV,if all were a single member where would the body be
5761,1CO,12,NRSV,as it is there are many members yet one body
5762,1CO,12,NRSV,the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of you nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you
5763,1CO,12,NRSV,on the contrary the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect whereas our more respectable members do not need this
5764,1CO,12,NRSV,but god has so arranged the body giving the greater honor to the inferior member that there may be no dissension within the body but the members may have the same care for one another
5765,1CO,12,NRSV,if one member suffers all suffer together with it if one member is honored all rejoice together with it
5766,1CO,12,NRSV,now you are the body of christ and individually members of it
5767,1CO,12,NRSV,and god has appointed in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then deeds of power then gifts of healing forms of assistance forms of leadership various kinds of tongues
5768,1CO,12,NRSV,are all apostles
5769,1CO,12,NRSV,are all prophets
5770,1CO,12,NRSV,are all teachers
5771,1CO,12,NRSV,do all work miracles
5772,1CO,12,NRSV,do all possess gifts of healing
5773,1CO,12,NRSV,do all speak in tongues
5774,1CO,12,NRSV,do all interpret
5775,1CO,12,NRSV,but strive for the greater gifts
5776,1CO,12,NRSV,and i will show you a still more excellent way
5777,1CO,13,NRSV,if i speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels but do not have love i am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal
5778,1CO,13,NRSV,and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love i am nothing
5779,1CO,13,NRSV,if i give away all my possessions and if i hand over my body so that i may boast but do not have love i gain nothing
5780,1CO,13,NRSV,love is patient love is kind love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude
5781,1CO,13,NRSV,it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice in wrongdoing but rejoices in the truth
5782,1CO,13,NRSV,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
5783,1CO,13,NRSV,love never ends
5784,1CO,13,NRSV,but as for prophecies they will come to an end as for tongues they will cease as for knowledge it will come to an end
5785,1CO,13,NRSV,for we know only in part and we prophesy only in part but when the complete comes the partial will come to an end
5786,1CO,13,NRSV,when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put an end to childish ways
5787,1CO,13,NRSV,for now we see in a mirror dimly but then we will see face to face
5788,1CO,13,NRSV,now i know only in part then i will know fully even as i have been fully known
5789,1CO,13,NRSV,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love
5790,1CO,14,NRSV,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy
5791,1CO,14,NRSV,for those who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to god for nobody understands them since they are speaking mysteries in the spirit
5792,1CO,14,NRSV,on the other hand those who prophesy speak to other people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation
5793,1CO,14,NRSV,those who speak in a tongue build up themselves but those who prophesy build up the church
5794,1CO,14,NRSV,now i would like all of you to speak in tongues but even more to prophesy
5795,1CO,14,NRSV,one who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may be built up
5796,1CO,14,NRSV,now brothers and sisters if i come to you speaking in tongues how will i benefit you unless i speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching
5797,1CO,14,NRSV,it is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound such as the flute or the harp
5798,1CO,14,NRSV,if they do not give distinct notes how will anyone know what is being played
5799,1CO,14,NRSV,and if the bugle gives an indistinct sound who will get ready for battle
5800,1CO,14,NRSV,so with yourselves if in a tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible how will anyone know what is being said
5801,1CO,14,NRSV,for you will be speaking into the air
5802,1CO,14,NRSV,there are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world and nothing is without sound
5803,1CO,14,NRSV,if then i do not know the meaning of a sound i will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me
5804,1CO,14,NRSV,so with yourselves since you are eager for spiritual gifts strive to excel in them for building up the church
5805,1CO,14,NRSV,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret
5806,1CO,14,NRSV,for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive
5807,1CO,14,NRSV,what should i do then
5808,1CO,14,NRSV,i will pray with the spirit but i will pray with the mind also i will sing praise with the spirit but i will sing praise with the mind also
5809,1CO,14,NRSV,otherwise if you say a blessing with the spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the amen to your thanksgiving since the outsider does not know what you are saying
5810,1CO,14,NRSV,for you may give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up
5811,1CO,14,NRSV,i thank god that i speak in tongues more than all of you nevertheless in church i would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others also than ten thousand words in a tongue
5812,1CO,14,NRSV,brothers and sisters do not be children in your thinking rather be infants in evil but in thinking be adults
5813,1CO,14,NRSV,in the law it is written by people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners i will speak to this people yet even then they will not listen to me says the lord
5814,1CO,14,NRSV,tongues then are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers
5815,1CO,14,NRSV,if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your mind
5816,1CO,14,NRSV,but if all prophesy an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all
5817,1CO,14,NRSV,after the secrets of the unbelievers heart are disclosed that person will bow down before god and worship him declaring god is really among you
5818,1CO,14,NRSV,what should be done then my friends
5819,1CO,14,NRSV,when you come together each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation
5820,1CO,14,NRSV,let all things be done for building up
5821,1CO,14,NRSV,if anyone speaks in a tongue let there be only two or at most three and each in turn and let one interpret
5822,1CO,14,NRSV,but if there is no one to interpret let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to god
5823,1CO,14,NRSV,let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said
5824,1CO,14,NRSV,if a revelation is made to someone else sitting nearby let the first person be silent
5825,1CO,14,NRSV,for you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged
5826,1CO,14,NRSV,and the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets for god is a god not of disorder but of peace
5827,1CO,14,NRSV,as in all the churches of the saints women should be silent in the churches
5828,1CO,14,NRSV,for they are not permitted to speak but should be subordinate as the law also says
5829,1CO,14,NRSV,if there is anything they desire to know let them ask their husbands at home
5830,1CO,14,NRSV,for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church
5831,1CO,14,NRSV,or did the word of god originate with you
5832,1CO,14,NRSV,or are you the only ones it has reached anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must acknowledge that what i am writing to you is a command of the lord
5833,1CO,14,NRSV,anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized
5834,1CO,14,NRSV,so my friends be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues but all things should be done decently and in order
5835,1CO,15,NRSV,now i would remind you brothers and sisters of the good news that i proclaimed to you which you in turn received in which also you stand through which also you are being saved if you hold firmly to the message that i proclaimed to youunless you have come to believe in vain
5836,1CO,15,NRSV,for i handed on to you as of first importance what i in turn had received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve
5837,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died
5838,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to james then to all the apostles
5839,1CO,15,NRSV,last of all as to one untimely born he appeared also to me
5840,1CO,15,NRSV,for i am the least of the apostles unfit to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god
5841,1CO,15,NRSV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me has not been in vain
5842,1CO,15,NRSV,on the contrary i worked harder than any of themthough it was not i but the grace of god that is with me
5843,1CO,15,NRSV,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe
5844,1CO,15,NRSV,now if christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead
5845,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain
5846,1CO,15,NRSV,we are even found to be misrepresenting god because we testified of god that he raised christwhom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised
5847,1CO,15,NRSV,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised
5848,1CO,15,NRSV,if christ has not been raised your faith is futile and you are still in your sins
5849,1CO,15,NRSV,then those also who have died in christ have perished
5850,1CO,15,NRSV,if for this life only we have hoped in christ we are of all people most to be pitied
5851,1CO,15,NRSV,but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have died
5852,1CO,15,NRSV,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ
5853,1CO,15,NRSV,but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at his coming those who belong to christ
5854,1CO,15,NRSV,then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power
5855,1CO,15,NRSV,for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet
5856,1CO,15,NRSV,the last enemy to be destroyed is death
5857,1CO,15,NRSV,for god has put all things in subjection under his feet
5858,1CO,15,NRSV,but when it says all things are put in subjection it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him
5859,1CO,15,NRSV,when all things are subjected to him then the son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him so that god may be all in all
5860,1CO,15,NRSV,otherwise what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead
5861,1CO,15,NRSV,if the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized on their behalf
5862,1CO,15,NRSV,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour
5863,1CO,15,NRSV,i die every day that is as certain brothers and sisters as my boasting of youa boast that i make in christ jesus our lord
5864,1CO,15,NRSV,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it
5865,1CO,15,NRSV,if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die
5866,1CO,15,NRSV,do not be deceived bad company ruins good morals
5867,1CO,15,NRSV,come to a sober and right mind and sin no more for some people have no knowledge of god
5868,1CO,15,NRSV,i say this to your shame
5869,1CO,15,NRSV,but someone will ask how are the dead raised
5870,1CO,15,NRSV,with what kind of body do they come
5871,1CO,15,NRSV,fool what you sow does not come to life unless it dies
5872,1CO,15,NRSV,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain
5873,1CO,15,NRSV,but god gives it a body as he has chosen and to each kind of seed its own body
5874,1CO,15,NRSV,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish
5875,1CO,15,NRSV,there are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one thing and that of the earthly is another
5876,1CO,15,NRSV,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory
5877,1CO,15,NRSV,so it is with the resurrection of the dead
5878,1CO,15,NRSV,what is sown is perishable what is raised is imperishable
5879,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory
5880,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in weakness it is raised in power
5881,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown a physical body it is raised a spiritual body
5882,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is a physical body there is also a spiritual body
5883,1CO,15,NRSV,thus it is written the first man adam became a living being the last adam became a lifegiving spirit
5884,1CO,15,NRSV,but it is not the spiritual that is first but the physical and then the spiritual
5885,1CO,15,NRSV,the first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is from heaven
5886,1CO,15,NRSV,as was the man of dust so are those who are of the dust and as is the man of heaven so are those who are of heaven
5887,1CO,15,NRSV,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven
5888,1CO,15,NRSV,what i am saying brothers and sisters is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable
5889,1CO,15,NRSV,listen i will tell you a mystery we will not all die but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet
5890,1CO,15,NRSV,for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed
5891,1CO,15,NRSV,for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality
5892,1CO,15,NRSV,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory
5893,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your victory
5894,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your sting
5895,1CO,15,NRSV,the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
5896,1CO,15,NRSV,but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ
5897,1CO,15,NRSV,therefore my beloved be steadfast immovable always excelling in the work of the lord because you know that in the lord your labor is not in vain
5898,1CO,16,NRSV,now concerning the collection for the saints you should follow the directions i gave to the churches of galatia
5899,1CO,16,NRSV,on the first day of every week each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn so that collections need not be taken when i come
5900,1CO,16,NRSV,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem
5901,1CO,16,NRSV,if it seems advisable that i should go also they will accompany me
5902,1CO,16,NRSV,i will visit you after passing through macedoniafor i intend to pass through macedonia and perhaps i will stay with you or even spend the winter so that you may send me on my way wherever i go
5903,1CO,16,NRSV,i do not want to see you now just in passing for i hope to spend some time with you if the lord permits
5904,1CO,16,NRSV,but i will stay in ephesus until pentecost for a wide door for effective work has opened to me and there are many adversaries
5905,1CO,16,NRSV,if timothy comes see that he has nothing to fear among you for he is doing the work of the lord just as i am therefore let no one despise him
5906,1CO,16,NRSV,send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am expecting him with the brothers
5907,1CO,16,NRSV,now concerning our brother apollos i strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers but he was not at all willing to come now
5908,1CO,16,NRSV,he will come when he has the opportunity
5909,1CO,16,NRSV,keep alert stand firm in your faith be courageous be strong
5910,1CO,16,NRSV,let all that you do be done in love
5911,1CO,16,NRSV,now brothers and sisters you know that members of the household of stephanas were the first converts in achaia and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints i urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people and of everyone who works and toils with them
5912,1CO,16,NRSV,i rejoice at the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus because they have made up for your absence for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours
5913,1CO,16,NRSV,so give recognition to such persons
5914,1CO,16,NRSV,the churches of asia send greetings
5915,1CO,16,NRSV,aquila and prisca together with the church in their house greet you warmly in the lord
5916,1CO,16,NRSV,all the brothers and sisters send greetings
5917,1CO,16,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss
5918,1CO,16,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand
5919,1CO,16,NRSV,let anyone be accursed who has no love for the lord
5920,1CO,16,NRSV,our lord come the grace of the lord jesus be with you
5921,1CO,16,NRSV,my love be with all of you in christ jesus
5922,2CO,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the church of god that is in corinth including all the saints throughout achaia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
5923,2CO,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all consolation who consoles us in all our affliction so that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction with the consolation with which we ourselves are consoled by god
5924,2CO,1,NRSV,for just as the sufferings of christ are abundant for us so also our consolation is abundant through christ
5925,2CO,1,NRSV,if we are being afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation if we are being consoled it is for your consolation which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering
5926,2CO,1,NRSV,our hope for you is unshaken for we know that as you share in our sufferings so also you share in our consolation
5927,2CO,1,NRSV,we do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters of the affliction we experienced in asia for we were so utterly unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself
5928,2CO,1,NRSV,indeed we felt that we had received the sentence of death so that we would rely not on ourselves but on god who raises the dead
5929,2CO,1,NRSV,he who rescued us from so deadly a peril will continue to rescue us on him we have set our hope that he will rescue us again as you also join in helping us by your prayers so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many
5930,2CO,1,NRSV,indeed this is our boast the testimony of our conscience we have behaved in the world with frankness and godly sincerity not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of godand all the more toward you
5931,2CO,1,NRSV,for we write you nothing other than what you can read and also understand i hope you will understand until the end as you have already understood us in partthat on the day of the lord jesus we are your boast even as you are our boast
5932,2CO,1,NRSV,since i was sure of this i wanted to come to you first so that you might have a double favor i wanted to visit you on my way to macedonia and to come back to you from macedonia and have you send me on to judea
5933,2CO,1,NRSV,was i vacillating when i wanted to do this
5934,2CO,1,NRSV,do i make my plans according to ordinary human standards ready to say yes yes and no no at the same time
5935,2CO,1,NRSV,as surely as god is faithful our word to you has not been yes and no for the son of god jesus christ whom we proclaimed among you silvanus and timothy and i was not yes and no but in him it is always yes
5936,2CO,1,NRSV,for in him every one of gods promises is a yes
5937,2CO,1,NRSV,for this reason it is through him that we say the amen to the glory of god
5938,2CO,1,NRSV,but it is god who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts as a first installment
5939,2CO,1,NRSV,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth
5940,2CO,1,NRSV,i do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith rather we are workers with you for your joy because you stand firm in the faith
5941,2CO,2,NRSV,so i made up my mind not to make you another painful visit
5942,2CO,2,NRSV,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained
5943,2CO,2,NRSV,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you
5944,2CO,2,NRSV,for i wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that i have for you
5945,2CO,2,NRSV,but if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but to some extentnot to exaggerate itto all of you
5946,2CO,2,NRSV,this punishment by the majority is enough for such a person so now instead you should forgive and console him so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow
5947,2CO,2,NRSV,so i urge you to reaffirm your love for him
5948,2CO,2,NRSV,i wrote for this reason to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything
5949,2CO,2,NRSV,anyone whom you forgive i also forgive
5950,2CO,2,NRSV,what i have forgiven if i have forgiven anything has been for your sake in the presence of christ
5951,2CO,2,NRSV,and we do this so that we may not be outwitted by satan for we are not ignorant of his designs
5952,2CO,2,NRSV,when i came to troas to proclaim the good news of christ a door was opened for me in the lord but my mind could not rest because i did not find my brother titus there
5953,2CO,2,NRSV,so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia
5954,2CO,2,NRSV,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him
5955,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are the aroma of christ to god among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing to the one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life
5956,2CO,2,NRSV,who is sufficient for these things
5957,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are not peddlers of gods word like so many but in christ we speak as persons of sincerity as persons sent from god and standing in his presence
5958,2CO,3,NRSV,are we beginning to commend ourselves again
5959,2CO,3,NRSV,surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we
5960,2CO,3,NRSV,you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts to be known and read by all and you show that you are a letter of christ prepared by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts
5961,2CO,3,NRSV,such is the confidence that we have through christ toward god
5962,2CO,3,NRSV,not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us our competence is from god who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not of letter but of spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life
5963,2CO,3,NRSV,now if the ministry of death chiseled in letters on stone tablets came in glory so that the people of israel could not gaze at moses face because of the glory of his face a glory now set aside how much more will the ministry of the spirit come in glory
5964,2CO,3,NRSV,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside
5965,2CO,3,NRSV,but their minds were hardened
5966,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day when they hear the reading of the old covenant that same veil is still there since only in christ is it set aside
5967,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed
5968,2CO,3,NRSV,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom
5969,2CO,3,NRSV,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit
5970,2CO,4,NRSV,therefore since it is by gods mercy that we are engaged in this ministry we do not lose heart
5971,2CO,4,NRSV,we have renounced the shameful things that one hides we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify gods word but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of god
5972,2CO,4,NRSV,and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing
5973,2CO,4,NRSV,in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
5974,2CO,4,NRSV,for we do not proclaim ourselves we proclaim jesus christ as lord and ourselves as your slaves for jesus sake
5975,2CO,4,NRSV,for it is the god who said let light shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
5976,2CO,4,NRSV,but we have this treasure in clay jars so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to god and does not come from us
5977,2CO,4,NRSV,we are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not driven to despair persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed always carrying in the body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be made visible in our bodies
5978,2CO,4,NRSV,for while we live we are always being given up to death for jesus sake so that the life of jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh
5979,2CO,4,NRSV,so death is at work in us but life in you
5980,2CO,4,NRSV,but just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripturei believed and so i spokewe also believe and so we speak because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus will raise us also with jesus and will bring us with you into his presence
5981,2CO,4,NRSV,yes everything is for your sake so that grace as it extends to more and more people may increase thanksgiving to the glory of god
5982,2CO,4,NRSV,so we do not lose heart
5983,2CO,4,NRSV,even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day
5984,2CO,4,NRSV,for this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal
5985,2CO,5,NRSV,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
5986,2CO,5,NRSV,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked
5987,2CO,5,NRSV,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
5988,2CO,5,NRSV,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee
5989,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight
5990,2CO,5,NRSV,yes we do have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord
5991,2CO,5,NRSV,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him
5992,2CO,5,NRSV,for all of us must appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body whether good or evil
5993,2CO,5,NRSV,therefore knowing the fear of the lord we try to persuade others but we ourselves are well known to god and i hope that we are also well known to your consciences
5994,2CO,5,NRSV,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart
5995,2CO,5,NRSV,for if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right mind it is for you
5996,2CO,5,NRSV,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died
5997,2CO,5,NRSV,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them
5998,2CO,5,NRSV,from now on therefore we regard no one from a human point of view even though we once knew christ from a human point of view we know him no longer in that way
5999,2CO,5,NRSV,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us
6000,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god
6001,2CO,5,NRSV,for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
6002,2CO,6,NRSV,as we work together with him we urge you also not to accept the grace of god in vain
6003,2CO,6,NRSV,for he says at an acceptable time i have listened to you and on a day of salvation i have helped you
6004,2CO,6,NRSV,see now is the acceptable time see now is the day of salvation we are putting no obstacle in anyones way so that no fault may be found with our ministry but as servants of god we have commended ourselves in every way through great endurance in afflictions hardships calamities beatings imprisonments riots labors sleepless nights hunger by purity knowledge patience kindness holiness of spirit genuine love truthful speech and the power of god with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left in honor and dishonor in ill repute and good repute
6005,2CO,6,NRSV,we are treated as impostors and yet are true as unknown and yet are well known as dying and seewe are alive as punished and yet not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing everything
6006,2CO,6,NRSV,we have spoken frankly to you corinthians our heart is wide open to you
6007,2CO,6,NRSV,there is no restriction in our affections but only in yours
6008,2CO,6,NRSV,in returni speak as to childrenopen wide your hearts also
6009,2CO,6,NRSV,do not be mismatched with unbelievers
6010,2CO,6,NRSV,for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness
6011,2CO,6,NRSV,or what fellowship is there between light and darkness
6012,2CO,6,NRSV,what agreement does christ have with beliar
6013,2CO,6,NRSV,or what does a believer share with an unbeliever
6014,2CO,6,NRSV,what agreement has the temple of god with idols
6015,2CO,6,NRSV,for we are the temple of the living god as god said i will live in them and walk among them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
6016,2CO,6,NRSV,therefore come out from them and be separate from them says the lord and touch nothing unclean then i will welcome you and i will be your father and you shall be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty
6017,2CO,7,NRSV,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god
6018,2CO,7,NRSV,make room in your hearts for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one
6019,2CO,7,NRSV,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together
6020,2CO,7,NRSV,i often boast about you i have great pride in you i am filled with consolation i am overjoyed in all our affliction
6021,2CO,7,NRSV,for even when we came into macedonia our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted in every waydisputes without and fears within
6022,2CO,7,NRSV,but god who consoles the downcast consoled us by the arrival of titus and not only by his coming but also by the consolation with which he was consoled about you as he told us of your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that i rejoiced still more
6023,2CO,7,NRSV,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly
6024,2CO,7,NRSV,now i rejoice not because you were grieved but because your grief led to repentance for you felt a godly grief so that you were not harmed in any way by us
6025,2CO,7,NRSV,for godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret but worldly grief produces death
6026,2CO,7,NRSV,for see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what zeal what punishment at every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter
6027,2CO,7,NRSV,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god
6028,2CO,7,NRSV,in this we find comfort
6029,2CO,7,NRSV,in addition to our own consolation we rejoiced still more at the joy of titus because his mind has been set at rest by all of you
6030,2CO,7,NRSV,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well
6031,2CO,7,NRSV,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling
6032,2CO,7,NRSV,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you
6033,2CO,8,NRSV,we want you to know brothers and sisters about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part
6034,2CO,8,NRSV,for as i can testify they voluntarily gave according to their means and even beyond their means begging us earnestly for the privilege of sharing in this ministry to the saints and this not merely as we expected they gave themselves first to the lord and by the will of god to us so that we might urge titus that as he had already made a beginning so he should also complete this generous undertaking among you
6035,2CO,8,NRSV,now as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in utmost eagerness and in our love for you so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking
6036,2CO,8,NRSV,i do not say this as a command but i am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others
6037,2CO,8,NRSV,for you know the generous act of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that by his poverty you might become rich
6038,2CO,8,NRSV,and in this matter i am giving my advice it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something now finish doing it so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means
6039,2CO,8,NRSV,for if the eagerness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one hasnot according to what one does not have
6040,2CO,8,NRSV,i do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you but it is a question of a fair balance between your present abundance and their need so that their abundance may be for your need in order that there may be a fair balance
6041,2CO,8,NRSV,as it is written the one who had much did not have too much and the one who had little did not have too little
6042,2CO,8,NRSV,but thanks be to god who put in the heart of titus the same eagerness for you that i myself have
6043,2CO,8,NRSV,for he not only accepted our appeal but since he is more eager than ever he is going to you of his own accord
6044,2CO,8,NRSV,with him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his proclaiming the good news and not only that but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this generous undertaking for the glory of the lord himself and to show our goodwill
6045,2CO,8,NRSV,we intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering for we intend to do what is right not only in the lords sight but also in the sight of others
6046,2CO,8,NRSV,and with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found eager in many matters but who is now more eager than ever because of his great confidence in you
6047,2CO,8,NRSV,as for titus he is my partner and coworker in your service as for our brothers they are messengers of the churches the glory of christ
6048,2CO,8,NRSV,therefore openly before the churches show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you
6049,2CO,9,NRSV,now it is not necessary for me to write you about the ministry to the saints for i know your eagerness which is the subject of my boasting about you to the people of macedonia saying that achaia has been ready since last year and your zeal has stirred up most of them
6050,2CO,9,NRSV,but i am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you may not prove to have been empty in this case so that you may be ready as i said you would be otherwise if some macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready we would be humiliatedto say nothing of youin this undertaking
6051,2CO,9,NRSV,so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for this bountiful gift that you have promised so that it may be ready as a voluntary gift and not as an extortion
6052,2CO,9,NRSV,the point is this the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully
6053,2CO,9,NRSV,each of you must give as you have made up your mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
6054,2CO,9,NRSV,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work
6055,2CO,9,NRSV,as it is written he scatters abroad he gives to the poor his righteousness endures forever
6056,2CO,9,NRSV,he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness
6057,2CO,9,NRSV,you will be enriched in every way for your great generosity which will produce thanksgiving to god through us for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to god
6058,2CO,9,NRSV,through the testing of this ministry you glorify god by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of god that he has given you
6059,2CO,9,NRSV,thanks be to god for his indescribable gift
6060,2CO,10,NRSV,i myself paul appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of christi who am humble when face to face with you but bold toward you when i am away i ask that when i am present i need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards
6061,2CO,10,NRSV,indeed we live as human beings but we do not wage war according to human standards for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human but they have divine power to destroy strongholds
6062,2CO,10,NRSV,we destroy arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of god and we take every thought captive to obey christ
6063,2CO,10,NRSV,we are ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete
6064,2CO,10,NRSV,look at what is before your eyes
6065,2CO,10,NRSV,if you are confident that you belong to christ remind yourself of this that just as you belong to christ so also do we
6066,2CO,10,NRSV,now even if i boast a little too much of our authority which the lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down i will not be ashamed of it
6067,2CO,10,NRSV,i do not want to seem as though i am trying to frighten you with my letters
6068,2CO,10,NRSV,for they say his letters are weighty and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible
6069,2CO,10,NRSV,let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent we will also do when present
6070,2CO,10,NRSV,we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves
6071,2CO,10,NRSV,but when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another they do not show good sense
6072,2CO,10,NRSV,we however will not boast beyond limits but will keep within the field that god has assigned to us to reach out even as far as you
6073,2CO,10,NRSV,for we were not overstepping our limits when we reached you we were the first to come all the way to you with the good news of christ
6074,2CO,10,NRSV,we do not boast beyond limits that is in the labors of others but our hope is that as your faith increases our sphere of action among you may be greatly enlarged so that we may proclaim the good news in lands beyond you without boasting of work already done in someone elses sphere of action
6075,2CO,10,NRSV,let the one who boasts boast in the lord
6076,2CO,10,NRSV,for it is not those who commend themselves that are approved but those whom the lord commends
6077,2CO,11,NRSV,i wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness
6078,2CO,11,NRSV,do bear with me i feel a divine jealousy for you for i promised you in marriage to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to christ
6079,2CO,11,NRSV,but i am afraid that as the serpent deceived eve by its cunning your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to christ
6080,2CO,11,NRSV,for if someone comes and proclaims another jesus than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you submit to it readily enough
6081,2CO,11,NRSV,i think that i am not in the least inferior to these superapostles
6082,2CO,11,NRSV,i may be untrained in speech but not in knowledge certainly in every way and in all things we have made this evident to you
6083,2CO,11,NRSV,did i commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted because i proclaimed gods good news to you free of charge
6084,2CO,11,NRSV,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you
6085,2CO,11,NRSV,and when i was with you and was in need i did not burden anyone for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from macedonia
6086,2CO,11,NRSV,so i refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way
6087,2CO,11,NRSV,as the truth of christ is in me this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of achaia
6088,2CO,11,NRSV,and why
6089,2CO,11,NRSV,because i do not love you
6090,2CO,11,NRSV,god knows i do and what i do i will also continue to do in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about
6091,2CO,11,NRSV,for such boasters are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ
6092,2CO,11,NRSV,and no wonder even satan disguises himself as an angel of light
6093,2CO,11,NRSV,so it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness
6094,2CO,11,NRSV,their end will match their deeds
6095,2CO,11,NRSV,i repeat let no one think that i am a fool but if you do then accept me as a fool so that i too may boast a little
6096,2CO,11,NRSV,what i am saying in regard to this boastful confidence i am saying not with the lords authority but as a fool since many boast according to human standards i will also boast
6097,2CO,11,NRSV,for you gladly put up with fools being wise yourselves for you put up with it when someone makes slaves of you or preys upon you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or gives you a slap in the face
6098,2CO,11,NRSV,to my shame i must say we were too weak for that but whatever anyone dares to boast ofi am speaking as a fooli also dare to boast of that
6099,2CO,11,NRSV,are they hebrews
6100,2CO,11,NRSV,so am i
6101,2CO,11,NRSV,are they israelites
6102,2CO,11,NRSV,so am i
6103,2CO,11,NRSV,are they descendants of abraham
6104,2CO,11,NRSV,so am i
6105,2CO,11,NRSV,are they ministers of christ
6106,2CO,11,NRSV,i am talking like a madmani am a better one with far greater labors far more imprisonments with countless floggings and often near death
6107,2CO,11,NRSV,five times i have received from the jews the forty lashes minus one
6108,2CO,11,NRSV,three times i was beaten with rods
6109,2CO,11,NRSV,once i received a stoning
6110,2CO,11,NRSV,three times i was shipwrecked for a night and a day i was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from bandits danger from my own people danger from gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers and sisters in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night hungry and thirsty often without food cold and naked
6111,2CO,11,NRSV,and besides other things i am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches
6112,2CO,11,NRSV,who is weak and i am not weak
6113,2CO,11,NRSV,who is made to stumble and i am not indignant
6114,2CO,11,NRSV,if i must boast i will boast of the things that show my weakness
6115,2CO,11,NRSV,the god and father of the lord jesus blessed be he forever knows that i do not lie
6116,2CO,11,NRSV,in damascus the governor under king aretas guarded the city of damascus in order to seize me but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands
6117,2CO,12,NRSV,it is necessary to boast nothing is to be gained by it but i will go on to visions and revelations of the lord
6118,2CO,12,NRSV,i know a person in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heavenwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows
6119,2CO,12,NRSV,and i know that such a personwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows was caught up into paradise and heard things that are not to be told that no mortal is permitted to repeat
6120,2CO,12,NRSV,on behalf of such a one i will boast but on my own behalf i will not boast except of my weaknesses
6121,2CO,12,NRSV,but if i wish to boast i will not be a fool for i will be speaking the truth
6122,2CO,12,NRSV,but i refrain from it so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me even considering the exceptional character of the revelations
6123,2CO,12,NRSV,therefore to keep me from being too elated a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to torment me to keep me from being too elated
6124,2CO,12,NRSV,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness
6125,2CO,12,NRSV,so i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may dwell in me
6126,2CO,12,NRSV,therefore i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for the sake of christ for whenever i am weak then i am strong
6127,2CO,12,NRSV,i have been a fool you forced me to it
6128,2CO,12,NRSV,indeed you should have been the ones commending me for i am not at all inferior to these superapostles even though i am nothing
6129,2CO,12,NRSV,the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience signs and wonders and mighty works
6130,2CO,12,NRSV,how have you been worse off than the other churches except that i myself did not burden you
6131,2CO,12,NRSV,forgive me this wrong here i am ready to come to you this third time
6132,2CO,12,NRSV,and i will not be a burden because i do not want what is yours but you for children ought not to lay up for their parents but parents for their children
6133,2CO,12,NRSV,i will most gladly spend and be spent for you
6134,2CO,12,NRSV,if i love you more am i to be loved less
6135,2CO,12,NRSV,let it be assumed that i did not burden you
6136,2CO,12,NRSV,nevertheless you say since i was crafty i took you in by deceit
6137,2CO,12,NRSV,did i take advantage of you through any of those whom i sent to you
6138,2CO,12,NRSV,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him
6139,2CO,12,NRSV,titus did not take advantage of you did he
6140,2CO,12,NRSV,did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit
6141,2CO,12,NRSV,did we not take the same steps
6142,2CO,12,NRSV,have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you
6143,2CO,12,NRSV,we are speaking in christ before god
6144,2CO,12,NRSV,everything we do beloved is for the sake of building you up
6145,2CO,12,NRSV,for i fear that when i come i may find you not as i wish and that you may find me not as you wish i fear that there may perhaps be quarreling jealousy anger selfishness slander gossip conceit and disorder
6146,2CO,12,NRSV,i fear that when i come again my god may humble me before you and that i may have to mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced
6147,2CO,13,NRSV,this is the third time i am coming to you
6148,2CO,13,NRSV,any charge must be sustained by the evidence of two or three witnesses
6149,2CO,13,NRSV,i warned those who sinned previously and all the others and i warn them now while absent as i did when present on my second visit that if i come again i will not be lenient since you desire proof that christ is speaking in me
6150,2CO,13,NRSV,he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful in you
6151,2CO,13,NRSV,for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god
6152,2CO,13,NRSV,for we are weak in him but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of god
6153,2CO,13,NRSV,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith
6154,2CO,13,NRSV,test yourselves
6155,2CO,13,NRSV,do you not realize that jesus christ is in youunless indeed you fail to meet the test i hope you will find out that we have not failed
6156,2CO,13,NRSV,but we pray to god that you may not do anything wrongnot that we may appear to have met the test but that you may do what is right though we may seem to have failed
6157,2CO,13,NRSV,for we cannot do anything against the truth but only for the truth
6158,2CO,13,NRSV,for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong
6159,2CO,13,NRSV,this is what we pray for that you may become perfect
6160,2CO,13,NRSV,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down
6161,2CO,13,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters farewell
6162,2CO,13,NRSV,put things in order listen to my appeal agree with one another live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you
6163,2CO,13,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss
6164,2CO,13,NRSV,all the saints greet you
6165,2CO,13,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with all of you
6166,GAL,1,NRSV,paul an apostlesent neither by human commission nor from human authorities but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the members of gods family who are with me to the churches of galatia grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age according to the will of our god and father to whom be the glory forever and ever
6167,GAL,1,NRSV,amen
6168,GAL,1,NRSV,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ
6169,GAL,1,NRSV,but even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you let that one be accursed as we have said before so now i repeat if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received let that one be accursed am i now seeking human approval or gods approval
6170,GAL,1,NRSV,or am i trying to please people
6171,GAL,1,NRSV,if i were still pleasing people i would not be a servant of christ
6172,GAL,1,NRSV,for i want you to know brothers and sisters that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin for i did not receive it from a human source nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ
6173,GAL,1,NRSV,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism
6174,GAL,1,NRSV,i was violently persecuting the church of god and was trying to destroy it
6175,GAL,1,NRSV,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors
6176,GAL,1,NRSV,but when god who had set me apart before i was born and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me so that i might proclaim him among the gentiles i did not confer with any human being nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me but i went away at once into arabia and afterwards i returned to damascus
6177,GAL,1,NRSV,then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit cephas and stayed with him fifteen days but i did not see any other apostle except james the lords brother
6178,GAL,1,NRSV,in what i am writing to you before god i do not lie then i went into the regions of syria and cilicia and i was still unknown by sight to the churches of judea that are in christ they only heard it said the one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy
6179,GAL,1,NRSV,and they glorified god because of me
6180,GAL,2,NRSV,then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus along with me
6181,GAL,2,NRSV,i went up in response to a revelation
6182,GAL,2,NRSV,then i laid before them though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders the gospel that i proclaim among the gentiles in order to make sure that i was not running or had not run in vain
6183,GAL,2,NRSV,but even titus who was with me was not compelled to be circumcised though he was a greek
6184,GAL,2,NRSV,but because of false believers secretly brought in who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus so that they might enslave us we did not submit to them even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you
6185,GAL,2,NRSV,and from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders what they actually were makes no difference to me god shows no partialitythose leaders contributed nothing to me
6186,GAL,2,NRSV,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised
6187,GAL,2,NRSV,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was eager to do
6188,GAL,2,NRSV,but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood selfcondemned for until certain people came from james he used to eat with the gentiles
6189,GAL,2,NRSV,but after they came he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction
6190,GAL,2,NRSV,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy
6191,GAL,2,NRSV,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews
6192,GAL,2,NRSV,we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ
6193,GAL,2,NRSV,and we have come to believe in christ jesus so that we might be justified by faith in christ and not by doing the works of the law because no one will be justified by the works of the law
6194,GAL,2,NRSV,but if in our effort to be justified in christ we ourselves have been found to be sinners is christ then a servant of sin
6195,GAL,2,NRSV,certainly not but if i build up again the very things that i once tore down then i demonstrate that i am a transgressor
6196,GAL,2,NRSV,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god
6197,GAL,2,NRSV,i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me
6198,GAL,2,NRSV,and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
6199,GAL,2,NRSV,i do not nullify the grace of god for if justification comes through the law then christ died for nothing
6200,GAL,3,NRSV,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you
6201,GAL,3,NRSV,it was before your eyes that jesus christ was publicly exhibited as crucified the only thing i want to learn from you is this did you receive the spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard
6202,GAL,3,NRSV,are you so foolish
6203,GAL,3,NRSV,having started with the spirit are you now ending with the flesh
6204,GAL,3,NRSV,did you experience so much for nothingif it really was for nothing
6205,GAL,3,NRSV,well then does god supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard
6206,GAL,3,NRSV,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham
6207,GAL,3,NRSV,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith declared the gospel beforehand to abraham saying all the gentiles shall be blessed in you
6208,GAL,3,NRSV,for this reason those who believe are blessed with abraham who believed
6209,GAL,3,NRSV,for all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law
6210,GAL,3,NRSV,now it is evident that no one is justified before god by the law for the one who is righteous will live by faith
6211,GAL,3,NRSV,but the law does not rest on faith on the contrary whoever does the works of the law will live by them
6212,GAL,3,NRSV,christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for usfor it is written cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree in order that in christ jesus the blessing of abraham might come to the gentiles so that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
6213,GAL,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters i give an example from daily life once a persons will has been ratified no one adds to it or annuls it
6214,GAL,3,NRSV,now the promises were made to abraham and to his offspring it does not say and to offsprings as of many but it says and to your offspring that is to one person who is christ
6215,GAL,3,NRSV,my point is this the law which came four hundred thirty years later does not annul a covenant previously ratified by god so as to nullify the promise
6216,GAL,3,NRSV,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise
6217,GAL,3,NRSV,why then the law
6218,GAL,3,NRSV,it was added because of transgressions until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made and it was ordained through angels by a mediator
6219,GAL,3,NRSV,now a mediator involves more than one party but god is one
6220,GAL,3,NRSV,is the law then opposed to the promises of god
6221,GAL,3,NRSV,certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law
6222,GAL,3,NRSV,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe
6223,GAL,3,NRSV,now before faith came we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed
6224,GAL,3,NRSV,therefore the law was our disciplinarian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith
6225,GAL,3,NRSV,but now that faith has come we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian for in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith
6226,GAL,3,NRSV,as many of you as were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ
6227,GAL,3,NRSV,there is no longer jew or greek there is no longer slave or free there is no longer male and female for all of you are one in christ jesus
6228,GAL,3,NRSV,and if you belong to christ then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to the promise
6229,GAL,4,NRSV,my point is this heirs as long as they are minors are no better than slaves though they are the owners of all the property but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father
6230,GAL,4,NRSV,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world
6231,GAL,4,NRSV,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children
6232,GAL,4,NRSV,and because you are children god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father so you are no longer a slave but a child and if a child then also an heir through god
6233,GAL,4,NRSV,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods
6234,GAL,4,NRSV,now however that you have come to know god or rather to be known by god how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits
6235,GAL,4,NRSV,how can you want to be enslaved to them again
6236,GAL,4,NRSV,you are observing special days and months and seasons and years
6237,GAL,4,NRSV,i am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted
6238,GAL,4,NRSV,friends i beg you become as i am for i also have become as you are
6239,GAL,4,NRSV,you have done me no wrong
6240,GAL,4,NRSV,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus
6241,GAL,4,NRSV,what has become of the goodwill you felt
6242,GAL,4,NRSV,for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me
6243,GAL,4,NRSV,have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth
6244,GAL,4,NRSV,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them
6245,GAL,4,NRSV,it is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times and not only when i am present with you
6246,GAL,4,NRSV,my little children for whom i am again in the pain of childbirth until christ is formed in you i wish i were present with you now and could change my tone for i am perplexed about you
6247,GAL,4,NRSV,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law
6248,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman
6249,GAL,4,NRSV,one the child of the slave was born according to the flesh the other the child of the free woman was born through the promise
6250,GAL,4,NRSV,now this is an allegory these women are two covenants
6251,GAL,4,NRSV,one woman in fact is hagar from mount sinai bearing children for slavery
6252,GAL,4,NRSV,now hagar is mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children
6253,GAL,4,NRSV,but the other woman corresponds to the jerusalem above she is free and she is our mother
6254,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written rejoice you childless one you who bear no children burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married
6255,GAL,4,NRSV,now you my friends are children of the promise like isaac
6256,GAL,4,NRSV,but just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the spirit so it is now also
6257,GAL,4,NRSV,but what does the scripture say
6258,GAL,4,NRSV,drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman
6259,GAL,4,NRSV,so then friends we are children not of the slave but of the free woman
6260,GAL,5,NRSV,for freedom christ has set us free
6261,GAL,5,NRSV,stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery
6262,GAL,5,NRSV,listen i paul am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you
6263,GAL,5,NRSV,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law
6264,GAL,5,NRSV,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace
6265,GAL,5,NRSV,for through the spirit by faith we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness
6266,GAL,5,NRSV,for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything the only thing that counts is faith working through love
6267,GAL,5,NRSV,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth
6268,GAL,5,NRSV,such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you
6269,GAL,5,NRSV,a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough
6270,GAL,5,NRSV,i am confident about you in the lord that you will not think otherwise
6271,GAL,5,NRSV,but whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty
6272,GAL,5,NRSV,but my friends why am i still being persecuted if i am still preaching circumcision
6273,GAL,5,NRSV,in that case the offense of the cross has been removed
6274,GAL,5,NRSV,i wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves for you were called to freedom brothers and sisters only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for selfindulgence but through love become slaves to one another
6275,GAL,5,NRSV,for the whole law is summed up in a single commandment you shall love your neighbor as yourself
6276,GAL,5,NRSV,if however you bite and devour one another take care that you are not consumed by one another
6277,GAL,5,NRSV,live by the spirit i say and do not gratify the desires of the flesh
6278,GAL,5,NRSV,for what the flesh desires is opposed to the spirit and what the spirit desires is opposed to the flesh for these are opposed to each other to prevent you from doing what you want
6279,GAL,5,NRSV,but if you are led by the spirit you are not subject to the law
6280,GAL,5,NRSV,now the works of the flesh are obvious fornication impurity licentiousness idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousy anger quarrels dissensions factions envy drunkenness carousing and things like these
6281,GAL,5,NRSV,i am warning you as i warned you before those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god
6282,GAL,5,NRSV,by contrast the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness generosity faithfulness gentleness and selfcontrol
6283,GAL,5,NRSV,there is no law against such things
6284,GAL,5,NRSV,and those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires
6285,GAL,5,NRSV,if we live by the spirit let us also be guided by the spirit
6286,GAL,5,NRSV,let us not become conceited competing against one another envying one another
6287,GAL,6,NRSV,my friends if anyone is detected in a transgression you who have received the spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness
6288,GAL,6,NRSV,take care that you yourselves are not tempted
6289,GAL,6,NRSV,bear one anothers burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ
6290,GAL,6,NRSV,for if those who are nothing think they are something they deceive themselves
6291,GAL,6,NRSV,all must test their own work then that work rather than their neighbors work will become a cause for pride
6292,GAL,6,NRSV,for all must carry their own loads
6293,GAL,6,NRSV,those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher
6294,GAL,6,NRSV,do not be deceived god is not mocked for you reap whatever you sow
6295,GAL,6,NRSV,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit
6296,GAL,6,NRSV,so let us not grow weary in doing what is right for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up
6297,GAL,6,NRSV,so then whenever we have an opportunity let us work for the good of all and especially for those of the family of faith
6298,GAL,6,NRSV,see what large letters i make when i am writing in my own hand it is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcisedonly that they may not be persecuted for the cross of christ
6299,GAL,6,NRSV,even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh
6300,GAL,6,NRSV,may i never boast of anything except the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
6301,GAL,6,NRSV,for neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything but a new creation is everything as for those who will follow this rulepeace be upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god
6302,GAL,6,NRSV,from now on let no one make trouble for me for i carry the marks of jesus branded on my body
6303,GAL,6,NRSV,may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers and sisters
6304,GAL,6,NRSV,amen
6305,EPH,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god to the saints who are in ephesus and are faithful in christ jesus grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
6306,EPH,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us in christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places just as he chose us in christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love
6307,EPH,1,NRSV,he destined us for adoption as his children through jesus christ according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the beloved
6308,EPH,1,NRSV,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us
6309,EPH,1,NRSV,with all wisdom and insight he has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure that he set forth in christ as a plan for the fullness of time to gather up all things in him things in heaven and things on earth
6310,EPH,1,NRSV,in christ we have also obtained an inheritance having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will so that we who were the first to set our hope on christ might live for the praise of his glory
6311,EPH,1,NRSV,in him you also when you had heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and had believed in him were marked with the seal of the promised holy spirit this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as gods own people to the praise of his glory
6312,EPH,1,NRSV,i have heard of your faith in the lord jesus and your love toward all the saints and for this reason i do not cease to give thanks for you as i remember you in my prayers
6313,EPH,1,NRSV,i pray that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him so that with the eyes of your heart enlightened you may know what is the hope to which he has called you what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe according to the working of his great power
6314,EPH,1,NRSV,god put this power to work in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is named not only in this age but also in the age to come
6315,EPH,1,NRSV,and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all
6316,EPH,2,NRSV,you were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived following the course of this world following the ruler of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient
6317,EPH,2,NRSV,all of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh following the desires of flesh and senses and we were by nature children of wrath like everyone else
6318,EPH,2,NRSV,but god who is rich in mercy out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus
6319,EPH,2,NRSV,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not the result of works so that no one may boast
6320,EPH,2,NRSV,for we are what he has made us created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand to be our way of life
6321,EPH,2,NRSV,so then remember that at one time you gentiles by birth called the uncircumcision by those who are called the circumcisiona physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands remember that you were at that time without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers to the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world
6322,EPH,2,NRSV,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ
6323,EPH,2,NRSV,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us
6324,EPH,2,NRSV,he has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two thus making peace and might reconcile both groups to god in one body through the cross thus putting to death that hostility through it
6325,EPH,2,NRSV,so he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near for through him both of us have access in one spirit to the father
6326,EPH,2,NRSV,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone
6327,EPH,2,NRSV,in him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for god
6328,EPH,3,NRSV,this is the reason that i paul am a prisoner for christ jesus for the sake of you gentiles for surely you have already heard of the commission of gods grace that was given me for you and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation as i wrote above in a few words a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of christ
6329,EPH,3,NRSV,in former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that is the gentiles have become fellow heirs members of the same body and sharers in the promise in christ jesus through the gospel
6330,EPH,3,NRSV,of this gospel i have become a servant according to the gift of gods grace that was given me by the working of his power
6331,EPH,3,NRSV,although i am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to me to bring to the gentiles the news of the boundless riches of christ and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in god who created all things so that through the church the wisdom of god in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places
6332,EPH,3,NRSV,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him
6333,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray therefore that you may not lose heart over my sufferings for you they are your glory
6334,EPH,3,NRSV,for this reason i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name
6335,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love
6336,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray that you may have the power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god
6337,EPH,3,NRSV,now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations forever and ever
6338,EPH,3,NRSV,amen
6339,EPH,4,NRSV,i therefore the prisoner in the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
6340,EPH,4,NRSV,there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in all
6341,EPH,4,NRSV,but each of us was given grace according to the measure of christs gift
6342,EPH,4,NRSV,therefore it is said when he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive he gave gifts to his people
6343,EPH,4,NRSV,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth
6344,EPH,4,NRSV,he who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things the gifts he gave were that some would be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of christ until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to maturity to the measure of the full stature of christ
6345,EPH,4,NRSV,we must no longer be children tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine by peoples trickery by their craftiness in deceitful scheming
6346,EPH,4,NRSV,but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ from whom the whole body joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped as each part is working properly promotes the bodys growth in building itself up in love
6347,EPH,4,NRSV,now this i affirm and insist on in the lord you must no longer live as the gentiles live in the futility of their minds
6348,EPH,4,NRSV,they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of their ignorance and hardness of heart
6349,EPH,4,NRSV,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity
6350,EPH,4,NRSV,that is not the way you learned christ for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus
6351,EPH,4,NRSV,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness
6352,EPH,4,NRSV,so then putting away falsehood let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors for we are members of one another
6353,EPH,4,NRSV,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not make room for the devil
6354,EPH,4,NRSV,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy
6355,EPH,4,NRSV,let no evil talk come out of your mouths but only what is useful for building up as there is need so that your words may give grace to those who hear
6356,EPH,4,NRSV,and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption
6357,EPH,4,NRSV,put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander together with all malice and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ has forgiven you
6358,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore be imitators of god as beloved children and live in love as christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god
6359,EPH,5,NRSV,but fornication and impurity of any kind or greed must not even be mentioned among you as is proper among saints
6360,EPH,5,NRSV,entirely out of place is obscene silly and vulgar talk but instead let there be thanksgiving
6361,EPH,5,NRSV,be sure of this that no fornicator or impure person or one who is greedy that is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
6362,EPH,5,NRSV,let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god comes on those who are disobedient
6363,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore do not be associated with them
6364,EPH,5,NRSV,for once you were darkness but now in the lord you are light
6365,EPH,5,NRSV,live as children of light for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true
6366,EPH,5,NRSV,try to find out what is pleasing to the lord
6367,EPH,5,NRSV,take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness but instead expose them
6368,EPH,5,NRSV,for it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly but everything exposed by the light becomes visible for everything that becomes visible is light
6369,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore it says sleeper awake rise from the dead and christ will shine on you
6370,EPH,5,NRSV,be careful then how you live not as unwise people but as wise making the most of the time because the days are evil
6371,EPH,5,NRSV,so do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is
6372,EPH,5,NRSV,do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery but be filled with the spirit as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves singing and making melody to the lord in your hearts giving thanks to god the father at all times and for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ
6373,EPH,5,NRSV,be subject to one another out of reverence for christ
6374,EPH,5,NRSV,wives be subject to your husbands as you are to the lord
6375,EPH,5,NRSV,for the husband is the head of the wife just as christ is the head of the church the body of which he is the savior
6376,EPH,5,NRSV,just as the church is subject to christ so also wives ought to be in everything to their husbands
6377,EPH,5,NRSV,husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word so as to present the church to himself in splendor without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kindyes so that she may be holy and without blemish
6378,EPH,5,NRSV,in the same way husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies
6379,EPH,5,NRSV,he who loves his wife loves himself
6380,EPH,5,NRSV,for no one ever hates his own body but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it just as christ does for the church because we are members of his body
6381,EPH,5,NRSV,for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
6382,EPH,5,NRSV,this is a great mystery and i am applying it to christ and the church
6383,EPH,5,NRSV,each of you however should love his wife as himself and a wife should respect her husband
6384,EPH,6,NRSV,children obey your parents in the lord for this is right
6385,EPH,6,NRSV,honor your father and motherthis is the first commandment with a promise so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth
6386,EPH,6,NRSV,and fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord
6387,EPH,6,NRSV,slaves obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as you obey christ not only while being watched and in order to please them but as slaves of christ doing the will of god from the heart
6388,EPH,6,NRSV,render service with enthusiasm as to the lord and not to men and women knowing that whatever good we do we will receive the same again from the lord whether we are slaves or free
6389,EPH,6,NRSV,and masters do the same to them
6390,EPH,6,NRSV,stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality
6391,EPH,6,NRSV,finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his power
6392,EPH,6,NRSV,put on the whole armor of god so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
6393,EPH,6,NRSV,for our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers of this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places
6394,EPH,6,NRSV,therefore take up the whole armor of god so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day and having done everything to stand firm
6395,EPH,6,NRSV,stand therefore and fasten the belt of truth around your waist and put on the breastplate of righteousness
6396,EPH,6,NRSV,as shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace
6397,EPH,6,NRSV,with all of these take the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one
6398,EPH,6,NRSV,take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
6399,EPH,6,NRSV,pray in the spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication
6400,EPH,6,NRSV,to that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints
6401,EPH,6,NRSV,pray also for me so that when i speak a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains
6402,EPH,6,NRSV,pray that i may declare it boldly as i must speak
6403,EPH,6,NRSV,so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing tychicus will tell you everything
6404,EPH,6,NRSV,he is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the lord
6405,EPH,6,NRSV,i am sending him to you for this very purpose to let you know how we are and to encourage your hearts
6406,EPH,6,NRSV,peace be to the whole community and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
6407,EPH,6,NRSV,grace be with all who have an undying love for our lord jesus christ
6408,PHP,1,NRSV,paul and timothy servants of christ jesus to all the saints in christ jesus who are in philippi with the bishops and deacons grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
6409,PHP,1,NRSV,i thank my god every time i remember you constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now
6410,PHP,1,NRSV,i am confident of this that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of jesus christ
6411,PHP,1,NRSV,it is right for me to think this way about all of you because you hold me in your heart for all of you share in gods grace with me both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel
6412,PHP,1,NRSV,for god is my witness how i long for all of you with the compassion of christ jesus
6413,PHP,1,NRSV,and this is my prayer that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best so that in the day of christ you may be pure and blameless having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through jesus christ for the glory and praise of god
6414,PHP,1,NRSV,i want you to know beloved that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for christ and most of the brothers and sisters having been made confident in the lord by my imprisonment dare to speak the word with greater boldness and without fear
6415,PHP,1,NRSV,some proclaim christ from envy and rivalry but others from goodwill
6416,PHP,1,NRSV,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment
6417,PHP,1,NRSV,what does it matter
6418,PHP,1,NRSV,just this that christ is proclaimed in every way whether out of false motives or true and in that i rejoice
6419,PHP,1,NRSV,yes and i will continue to rejoice for i know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ this will turn out for my deliverance
6420,PHP,1,NRSV,it is my eager expectation and hope that i will not be put to shame in any way but that by my speaking with all boldness christ will be exalted now as always in my body whether by life or by death
6421,PHP,1,NRSV,for to me living is christ and dying is gain
6422,PHP,1,NRSV,if i am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me and i do not know which i prefer
6423,PHP,1,NRSV,i am hard pressed between the two my desire is to depart and be with christ for that is far better but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you
6424,PHP,1,NRSV,since i am convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith so that i may share abundantly in your boasting in christ jesus when i come to you again
6425,PHP,1,NRSV,only live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come and see you or am absent and hear about you i will know that you are standing firm in one spirit striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel and are in no way intimidated by your opponents
6426,PHP,1,NRSV,for them this is evidence of their destruction but of your salvation
6427,PHP,1,NRSV,and this is gods doing
6428,PHP,1,NRSV,for he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in christ but of suffering for him as well since you are having the same struggle that you saw i had and now hear that i still have
6429,PHP,2,NRSV,if then there is any encouragement in christ any consolation from love any sharing in the spirit any compassion and sympathy make my joy complete be of the same mind having the same love being in full accord and of one mind
6430,PHP,2,NRSV,do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit but in humility regard others as better than yourselves
6431,PHP,2,NRSV,let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others
6432,PHP,2,NRSV,let the same mind be in you that was in christ jesus who though he was in the form of god did not regard equality with god as something to be exploited but emptied himself taking the form of a slave being born in human likeness
6433,PHP,2,NRSV,and being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death even death on a cross
6434,PHP,2,NRSV,therefore god also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bend in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
6435,PHP,2,NRSV,therefore my beloved just as you have always obeyed me not only in my presence but much more now in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who is at work in you enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
6436,PHP,2,NRSV,do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world
6437,PHP,2,NRSV,it is by your holding fast to the word of life that i can boast on the day of christ that i did not run in vain or labor in vain
6438,PHP,2,NRSV,but even if i am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me
6439,PHP,2,NRSV,i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon so that i may be cheered by news of you
6440,PHP,2,NRSV,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare
6441,PHP,2,NRSV,all of them are seeking their own interests not those of jesus christ
6442,PHP,2,NRSV,but timothys worth you know how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel
6443,PHP,2,NRSV,i hope therefore to send him as soon as i see how things go with me and i trust in the lord that i will also come soon
6444,PHP,2,NRSV,still i think it necessary to send to you epaphroditusmy brother and coworker and fellow soldier your messenger and minister to my need for he has been longing for all of you and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill
6445,PHP,2,NRSV,he was indeed so ill that he nearly died
6446,PHP,2,NRSV,but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me also so that i would not have one sorrow after another
6447,PHP,2,NRSV,i am the more eager to send him therefore in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again and that i may be less anxious
6448,PHP,2,NRSV,welcome him then in the lord with all joy and honor such people because he came close to death for the work of christ risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me
6449,PHP,3,NRSV,finally my brothers and sisters rejoice in the lord
6450,PHP,3,NRSV,to write the same things to you is not troublesome to me and for you it is a safeguard
6451,PHP,3,NRSV,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh
6452,PHP,3,NRSV,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless
6453,PHP,3,NRSV,yet whatever gains i had these i have come to regard as loss because of christ
6454,PHP,3,NRSV,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord
6455,PHP,3,NRSV,for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and i regard them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but one that comes through faith in christ the righteousness from god based on faith
6456,PHP,3,NRSV,i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead
6457,PHP,3,NRSV,not that i have already obtained this or have already reached the goal but i press on to make it my own because christ jesus has made me his own
6458,PHP,3,NRSV,beloved i do not consider that i have made it my own but this one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead i press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of god in christ jesus
6459,PHP,3,NRSV,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you
6460,PHP,3,NRSV,only let us hold fast to what we have attained
6461,PHP,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters join in imitating me and observe those who live according to the example you have in us
6462,PHP,3,NRSV,for many live as enemies of the cross of christ i have often told you of them and now i tell you even with tears
6463,PHP,3,NRSV,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things
6464,PHP,3,NRSV,but our citizenship is in heaven and it is from there that we are expecting a savior the lord jesus christ
6465,PHP,3,NRSV,he will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself
6466,PHP,4,NRSV,therefore my brothers and sisters whom i love and long for my joy and crown stand firm in the lord in this way my beloved
6467,PHP,4,NRSV,i urge euodia and i urge syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord
6468,PHP,4,NRSV,yes and i ask you also my loyal companion help these women for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel together with clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life
6469,PHP,4,NRSV,rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice
6470,PHP,4,NRSV,let your gentleness be known to everyone
6471,PHP,4,NRSV,the lord is near
6472,PHP,4,NRSV,do not worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god
6473,PHP,4,NRSV,and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
6474,PHP,4,NRSV,finally beloved whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever is commendable if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things
6475,PHP,4,NRSV,keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and the god of peace will be with you
6476,PHP,4,NRSV,i rejoice in the lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me indeed you were concerned for me but had no opportunity to show it
6477,PHP,4,NRSV,not that i am referring to being in need for i have learned to be content with whatever i have
6478,PHP,4,NRSV,i know what it is to have little and i know what it is to have plenty
6479,PHP,4,NRSV,in any and all circumstances i have learned the secret of being wellfed and of going hungry of having plenty and of being in need
6480,PHP,4,NRSV,i can do all things through him who strengthens me
6481,PHP,4,NRSV,in any case it was kind of you to share my distress
6482,PHP,4,NRSV,you philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel when i left macedonia no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone
6483,PHP,4,NRSV,for even when i was in thessalonica you sent me help for my needs more than once
6484,PHP,4,NRSV,not that i seek the gift but i seek the profit that accumulates to your account
6485,PHP,4,NRSV,i have been paid in full and have more than enough i am fully satisfied now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to god
6486,PHP,4,NRSV,and my god will fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory in christ jesus
6487,PHP,4,NRSV,to our god and father be glory forever and ever
6488,PHP,4,NRSV,amen
6489,PHP,4,NRSV,greet every saint in christ jesus
6490,PHP,4,NRSV,the friends who are with me greet you
6491,PHP,4,NRSV,all the saints greet you especially those of the emperors household
6492,PHP,4,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit
6493,COL,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in christ in colossae grace to you and peace from god our father
6494,COL,1,NRSV,in our prayers for you we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ for we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints because of the hope laid up for you in heaven
6495,COL,1,NRSV,you have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth the gospel that has come to you
6496,COL,1,NRSV,just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of god
6497,COL,1,NRSV,this you learned from epaphras our beloved fellow servant
6498,COL,1,NRSV,he is a faithful minister of christ on your behalf and he has made known to us your love in the spirit
6499,COL,1,NRSV,for this reason since the day we heard it we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of gods will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding so that you may lead lives worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of god
6500,COL,1,NRSV,may you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience while joyfully giving thanks to the father who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light
6501,COL,1,NRSV,he has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins
6502,COL,1,NRSV,he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created things visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powersall things have been created through him and for him
6503,COL,1,NRSV,he himself is before all things and in him all things hold together
6504,COL,1,NRSV,he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might come to have first place in everything
6505,COL,1,NRSV,for in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him god was pleased to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven by making peace through the blood of his cross
6506,COL,1,NRSV,and you who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven
6507,COL,1,NRSV,i paul became a servant of this gospel
6508,COL,1,NRSV,i am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh i am completing what is lacking in christs afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church
6509,COL,1,NRSV,i became its servant according to gods commission that was given to me for you to make the word of god fully known the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints
6510,COL,1,NRSV,to them god chose to make known how great among the gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory
6511,COL,1,NRSV,it is he whom we proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom so that we may present everyone mature in christ
6512,COL,1,NRSV,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me
6513,COL,2,NRSV,for i want you to know how much i am struggling for you and for those in laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face
6514,COL,2,NRSV,i want their hearts to be encouraged and united in love so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding and have the knowledge of gods mystery that is christ himself in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
6515,COL,2,NRSV,i am saying this so that no one may deceive you with plausible arguments
6516,COL,2,NRSV,for though i am absent in body yet i am with you in spirit and i rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in christ
6517,COL,2,NRSV,as you therefore have received christ jesus the lord continue to live your lives in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith just as you were taught abounding in thanksgiving
6518,COL,2,NRSV,see to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition according to the elemental spirits of the universe and not according to christ
6519,COL,2,NRSV,for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily and you have come to fullness in him who is the head of every ruler and authority
6520,COL,2,NRSV,in him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ when you were buried with him in baptism you were also raised with him through faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead
6521,COL,2,NRSV,and when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god made you alive together with him when he forgave us all our trespasses erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands
6522,COL,2,NRSV,he set this aside nailing it to the cross
6523,COL,2,NRSV,he disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them triumphing over them in it
6524,COL,2,NRSV,therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals new moons or sabbaths
6525,COL,2,NRSV,these are only a shadow of what is to come but the substance belongs to christ
6526,COL,2,NRSV,do not let anyone disqualify you insisting on selfabasement and worship of angels dwelling on visions puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking and not holding fast to the head from whom the whole body nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows with a growth that is from god
6527,COL,2,NRSV,if with christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe why do you live as if you still belonged to the world
6528,COL,2,NRSV,why do you submit to regulations do not handle do not taste do not touch
6529,COL,2,NRSV,all these regulations refer to things that perish with use they are simply human commands and teachings
6530,COL,2,NRSV,these have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting selfimposed piety humility and severe treatment of the body but they are of no value in checking selfindulgence
6531,COL,3,NRSV,so if you have been raised with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god
6532,COL,3,NRSV,set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god
6533,COL,3,NRSV,when christ who is your life is revealed then you also will be revealed with him in glory
6534,COL,3,NRSV,put to death therefore whatever in you is earthly fornication impurity passion evil desire and greed which is idolatry
6535,COL,3,NRSV,on account of these the wrath of god is coming on those who are disobedient
6536,COL,3,NRSV,these are the ways you also once followed when you were living that life
6537,COL,3,NRSV,but now you must get rid of all such thingsanger wrath malice slander and abusive language from your mouth
6538,COL,3,NRSV,do not lie to one another seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator
6539,COL,3,NRSV,in that renewal there is no longer greek and jew circumcised and uncircumcised barbarian scythian slave and free but christ is all and in all as gods chosen ones holy and beloved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility meekness and patience
6540,COL,3,NRSV,bear with one another and if anyone has a complaint against another forgive each other just as the lord has forgiven you so you also must forgive
6541,COL,3,NRSV,above all clothe yourselves with love which binds everything together in perfect harmony
6542,COL,3,NRSV,and let the peace of christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called in the one body
6543,COL,3,NRSV,and be thankful
6544,COL,3,NRSV,let the word of christ dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs to god
6545,COL,3,NRSV,and whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
6546,COL,3,NRSV,wives be subject to your husbands as is fitting in the lord
6547,COL,3,NRSV,husbands love your wives and never treat them harshly
6548,COL,3,NRSV,children obey your parents in everything for this is your acceptable duty in the lord
6549,COL,3,NRSV,fathers do not provoke your children or they may lose heart
6550,COL,3,NRSV,slaves obey your earthly masters in everything not only while being watched and in order to please them but wholeheartedly fearing the lord
6551,COL,3,NRSV,whatever your task put yourselves into it as done for the lord and not for your masters since you know that from the lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you serve the lord christ
6552,COL,3,NRSV,for the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done and there is no partiality
6553,COL,4,NRSV,masters treat your slaves justly and fairly for you know that you also have a master in heaven
6554,COL,4,NRSV,devote yourselves to prayer keeping alert in it with thanksgiving
6555,COL,4,NRSV,at the same time pray for us as well that god will open to us a door for the word that we may declare the mystery of christ for which i am in prison so that i may reveal it clearly as i should
6556,COL,4,NRSV,conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders making the most of the time
6557,COL,4,NRSV,let your speech always be gracious seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone
6558,COL,4,NRSV,tychicus will tell you all the news about me he is a beloved brother a faithful minister and a fellow servant in the lord
6559,COL,4,NRSV,i have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts he is coming with onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you
6560,COL,4,NRSV,they will tell you about everything here
6561,COL,4,NRSV,aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you as does mark the cousin of barnabas concerning whom you have received instructionsif he comes to you welcome him
6562,COL,4,NRSV,and jesus who is called justus greets you
6563,COL,4,NRSV,these are the only ones of the circumcision among my coworkers for the kingdom of god and they have been a comfort to me
6564,COL,4,NRSV,epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus greets you
6565,COL,4,NRSV,he is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that god wills
6566,COL,4,NRSV,for i testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in laodicea and in hierapolis
6567,COL,4,NRSV,luke the beloved physician and demas greet you
6568,COL,4,NRSV,give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in laodicea and to nympha and the church in her house
6569,COL,4,NRSV,and when this letter has been read among you have it read also in the church of the laodiceans and see that you read also the letter from laodicea
6570,COL,4,NRSV,and say to archippus see that you complete the task that you have received in the lord
6571,COL,4,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand
6572,COL,4,NRSV,remember my chains
6573,COL,4,NRSV,grace be with you
6574,1TH,1,NRSV,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace
6575,1TH,1,NRSV,we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ
6576,1TH,1,NRSV,for we know brothers and sisters beloved by god that he has chosen you because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake
6577,1TH,1,NRSV,and you became imitators of us and of the lord for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the holy spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia
6578,1TH,1,NRSV,for the word of the lord has sounded forth from you not only in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith in god has become known so that we have no need to speak about it
6579,1TH,1,NRSV,for the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you and how you turned to god from idols to serve a living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the deadjesus who rescues us from the wrath that is coming
6580,1TH,2,NRSV,you yourselves know brothers and sisters that our coming to you was not in vain but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at philippi as you know we had courage in our god to declare to you the gospel of god in spite of great opposition
6581,1TH,2,NRSV,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts
6582,1TH,2,NRSV,as you know and as god is our witness we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed nor did we seek praise from mortals whether from you or from others though we might have made demands as apostles of christ
6583,1TH,2,NRSV,but we were gentle among you like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children
6584,1TH,2,NRSV,so deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own selves because you have become very dear to us
6585,1TH,2,NRSV,you remember our labor and toil brothers and sisters we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of god
6586,1TH,2,NRSV,you are witnesses and god also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was toward you believers
6587,1TH,2,NRSV,as you know we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of god who calls you into his own kingdom and glory
6588,1TH,2,NRSV,we also constantly give thanks to god for this that when you received the word of god that you heard from us you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is gods word which is also at work in you believers
6589,1TH,2,NRSV,for you brothers and sisters became imitators of the churches of god in christ jesus that are in judea for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the jews who killed both the lord jesus and the prophets and drove us out they displease god and oppose everyone by hindering us from speaking to the gentiles so that they may be saved
6590,1TH,2,NRSV,thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins but gods wrath has overtaken them at last
6591,1TH,2,NRSV,as for us brothers and sisters when for a short time we were made orphans by being separated from youin person not in heartwe longed with great eagerness to see you face to face
6592,1TH,2,NRSV,for we wanted to come to youcertainly i paul wanted to again and againbut satan blocked our way
6593,1TH,2,NRSV,for what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our lord jesus at his coming
6594,1TH,2,NRSV,is it not you
6595,1TH,2,NRSV,yes you are our glory and joy
6596,1TH,3,NRSV,therefore when we could bear it no longer we decided to be left alone in athens and we sent timothy our brother and coworker for god in proclaiming the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions
6597,1TH,3,NRSV,indeed you yourselves know that this is what we are destined for
6598,1TH,3,NRSV,in fact when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution so it turned out as you know
6599,1TH,3,NRSV,for this reason when i could bear it no longer i sent to find out about your faith i was afraid that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor had been in vain
6600,1TH,3,NRSV,but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought us the good news of your faith and love
6601,1TH,3,NRSV,he has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see usjust as we long to see you
6602,1TH,3,NRSV,for this reason brothers and sisters during all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you through your faith
6603,1TH,3,NRSV,for we now live if you continue to stand firm in the lord
6604,1TH,3,NRSV,how can we thank god enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our god because of you
6605,1TH,3,NRSV,night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith
6606,1TH,3,NRSV,now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus direct our way to you
6607,1TH,3,NRSV,and may the lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all just as we abound in love for you
6608,1TH,3,NRSV,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints
6609,1TH,4,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters we ask and urge you in the lord jesus that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please god as in fact you are doing you should do so more and more
6610,1TH,4,NRSV,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus
6611,1TH,4,NRSV,for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from fornication that each one of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor not with lustful passion like the gentiles who do not know god that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister in this matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you
6612,1TH,4,NRSV,for god did not call us to impurity but in holiness
6613,1TH,4,NRSV,therefore whoever rejects this rejects not human authority but god who also gives his holy spirit to you
6614,1TH,4,NRSV,now concerning love of the brothers and sisters you do not need to have anyone write to you for you yourselves have been taught by god to love one another and indeed you do love all the brothers and sisters throughout macedonia
6615,1TH,4,NRSV,but we urge you beloved to do so more and more to aspire to live quietly to mind your own affairs and to work with your hands as we directed you so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and be dependent on no one
6616,1TH,4,NRSV,but we do not want you to be uninformed brothers and sisters about those who have died so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope
6617,1TH,4,NRSV,for since we believe that jesus died and rose again even so through jesus god will bring with him those who have died
6618,1TH,4,NRSV,for this we declare to you by the word of the lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the lord will by no means precede those who have died
6619,1TH,4,NRSV,for the lord himself with a cry of command with the archangels call and with the sound of gods trumpet will descend from heaven and the dead in christ will rise first
6620,1TH,4,NRSV,then we who are alive who are left will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the lord in the air and so we will be with the lord forever
6621,1TH,4,NRSV,therefore encourage one another with these words
6622,1TH,5,NRSV,now concerning the times and the seasons brothers and sisters you do not need to have anything written to you
6623,1TH,5,NRSV,for you yourselves know very well that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night
6624,1TH,5,NRSV,when they say there is peace and security then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman and there will be no escape but you beloved are not in darkness for that day to surprise you like a thief for you are all children of light and children of the day we are not of the night or of darkness
6625,1TH,5,NRSV,so then let us not fall asleep as others do but let us keep awake and be sober for those who sleep sleep at night and those who are drunk get drunk at night
6626,1TH,5,NRSV,but since we belong to the day let us be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation
6627,1TH,5,NRSV,for god has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our lord jesus christ who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him
6628,1TH,5,NRSV,therefore encourage one another and build up each other as indeed you are doing
6629,1TH,5,NRSV,but we appeal to you brothers and sisters to respect those who labor among you and have charge of you in the lord and admonish you esteem them very highly in love because of their work
6630,1TH,5,NRSV,be at peace among yourselves
6631,1TH,5,NRSV,and we urge you beloved to admonish the idlers encourage the faint hearted help the weak be patient with all of them
6632,1TH,5,NRSV,see that none of you repays evil for evil but always seek to do good to one another and to all
6633,1TH,5,NRSV,rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you
6634,1TH,5,NRSV,do not quench the spirit
6635,1TH,5,NRSV,do not despise the words of prophets but test everything hold fast to what is good abstain from every form of evil
6636,1TH,5,NRSV,may the god of peace himself sanctify you entirely and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ
6637,1TH,5,NRSV,the one who calls you is faithful and he will do this
6638,1TH,5,NRSV,beloved pray for us
6639,1TH,5,NRSV,greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss
6640,1TH,5,NRSV,i solemnly command you by the lord that this letter be read to all of them
6641,1TH,5,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
6642,2TH,1,NRSV,paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
6643,2TH,1,NRSV,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing
6644,2TH,1,NRSV,therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of god for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring
6645,2TH,1,NRSV,this is evidence of the righteous judgment of god and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are also suffering
6646,2TH,1,NRSV,for it is indeed just of god to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus
6647,2TH,1,NRSV,these will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction separated from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his might when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at on that day among all who have believed because our testimony to you was believed
6648,2TH,1,NRSV,to this end we always pray for you asking that our god will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
6649,2TH,2,NRSV,as to the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we beg you brothers and sisters not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by spirit or by word or by letter as though from us to the effect that the day of the lord is already here
6650,2TH,2,NRSV,let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed the one destined for destruction
6651,2TH,2,NRSV,he opposes and exalts himself above every socalled god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god declaring himself to be god
6652,2TH,2,NRSV,do you not remember that i told you these things when i was still with you
6653,2TH,2,NRSV,and you know what is now restraining him so that he may be revealed when his time comes
6654,2TH,2,NRSV,for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work but only until the one who now restrains it is removed
6655,2TH,2,NRSV,and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will destroy with the breath of his mouth annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming
6656,2TH,2,NRSV,the coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of satan who uses all power signs lying wonders and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved
6657,2TH,2,NRSV,for this reason god sends them a powerful delusion leading them to believe what is false so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned
6658,2TH,2,NRSV,but we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters beloved by the lord because god chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and through belief in the truth
6659,2TH,2,NRSV,for this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news so that you may obtain the glory of our lord jesus christ
6660,2TH,2,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us either by word of mouth or by our letter
6661,2TH,2,NRSV,now may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word
6662,2TH,3,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters pray for us so that the word of the lord may spread rapidly and be glorified everywhere just as it is among you and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people for not all have faith
6663,2TH,3,NRSV,but the lord is faithful he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one
6664,2TH,3,NRSV,and we have confidence in the lord concerning you that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command
6665,2TH,3,NRSV,may the lord direct your hearts to the love of god and to the steadfastness of christ
6666,2TH,3,NRSV,now we command you beloved in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us
6667,2TH,3,NRSV,for you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us we were not idle when we were with you and we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you
6668,2TH,3,NRSV,this was not because we do not have that right but in order to give you an example to imitate
6669,2TH,3,NRSV,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat
6670,2TH,3,NRSV,for we hear that some of you are living in idleness mere busybodies not doing any work
6671,2TH,3,NRSV,now such persons we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living
6672,2TH,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters do not be weary in doing what is right
6673,2TH,3,NRSV,take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter have nothing to do with them so that they may be ashamed
6674,2TH,3,NRSV,do not regard them as enemies but warn them as believers
6675,2TH,3,NRSV,now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways
6676,2TH,3,NRSV,the lord be with all of you
6677,2TH,3,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand
6678,2TH,3,NRSV,this is the mark in every letter of mine it is the way i write
6679,2TH,3,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with all of you
6680,1TI,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our savior and of christ jesus our hope to timothy my loyal child in the faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
6681,1TI,1,NRSV,i urge you as i did when i was on my way to macedonia to remain in ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith
6682,1TI,1,NRSV,but the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart a good conscience and sincere faith
6683,1TI,1,NRSV,some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk desiring to be teachers of the law without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions
6684,1TI,1,NRSV,now we know that the law is good if one uses it legitimately
6685,1TI,1,NRSV,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me
6686,1TI,1,NRSV,i am grateful to christ jesus our lord who has strengthened me because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service even though i was formerly a blasphemer a persecutor and a man of violence
6687,1TI,1,NRSV,but i received mercy because i had acted ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in christ jesus
6688,1TI,1,NRSV,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom i am the foremost
6689,1TI,1,NRSV,but for that very reason i received mercy so that in me as the foremost jesus christ might display the utmost patience making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life
6690,1TI,1,NRSV,to the king of the ages immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever
6691,1TI,1,NRSV,amen
6692,1TI,1,NRSV,i am giving you these instructions timothy my child in accordance with the prophecies made earlier about you so that by following them you may fight the good fight having faith and a good conscience
6693,1TI,1,NRSV,by rejecting conscience certain persons have suffered shipwreck in the faith among them are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have turned over to satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme
6694,1TI,2,NRSV,first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone for kings and all who are in high positions so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity
6695,1TI,2,NRSV,this is right and is acceptable in the sight of god our savior who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
6696,1TI,2,NRSV,for there is one god there is also one mediator between god and humankind christ jesus himself human who gave himself a ransom for all this was attested at the right time
6697,1TI,2,NRSV,for this i was appointed a herald and an apostle i am telling the truth i am not lying a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth
6698,1TI,2,NRSV,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god
6699,1TI,2,NRSV,let a woman learn in silence with full submission
6700,1TI,2,NRSV,i permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man she is to keep silent
6701,1TI,2,NRSV,for adam was formed first then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor
6702,1TI,2,NRSV,yet she will be saved through childbearing provided they continue in faith and love and holiness with modesty
6703,1TI,3,NRSV,the saying is sure whoever aspires to the office of bishop desires a noble task
6704,1TI,3,NRSV,now a bishop must be above reproach married only once temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money
6705,1TI,3,NRSV,he must manage his own household well keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how can he take care of gods church
6706,1TI,3,NRSV,he must not be a recent convert or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil
6707,1TI,3,NRSV,moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil
6708,1TI,3,NRSV,deacons likewise must be serious not doubletongued not indulging in much wine not greedy for money they must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
6709,1TI,3,NRSV,and let them first be tested then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons
6710,1TI,3,NRSV,women likewise must be serious not slanderers but temperate faithful in all things
6711,1TI,3,NRSV,let deacons be married only once and let them manage their children and their households well for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in christ jesus
6712,1TI,3,NRSV,i hope to come to you soon but i am writing these instructions to you so that if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and bulwark of the truth
6713,1TI,3,NRSV,without any doubt the mystery of our religion is great he was revealed in flesh vindicated in spirit seen by angels proclaimed among gentiles believed in throughout the world taken up in glory
6714,1TI,4,NRSV,now the spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron
6715,1TI,4,NRSV,they forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth
6716,1TI,4,NRSV,for everything created by god is good and nothing is to be rejected provided it is received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by gods word and by prayer
6717,1TI,4,NRSV,if you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters you will be a good servant of christ jesus nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed
6718,1TI,4,NRSV,have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives tales
6719,1TI,4,NRSV,train yourself in godliness for while physical training is of some value godliness is valuable in every way holding promise for both the present life and the life to come
6720,1TI,4,NRSV,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance
6721,1TI,4,NRSV,for to this end we toil and struggle because we have our hope set on the living god who is the savior of all people especially of those who believe
6722,1TI,4,NRSV,these are the things you must insist on and teach
6723,1TI,4,NRSV,let no one despise your youth but set the believers an example in speech and conduct in love in faith in purity
6724,1TI,4,NRSV,until i arrive give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhorting to teaching
6725,1TI,4,NRSV,do not neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders
6726,1TI,4,NRSV,put these things into practice devote yourself to them so that all may see your progress
6727,1TI,4,NRSV,pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers
6728,1TI,5,NRSV,do not speak harshly to an older man but speak to him as to a father to younger men as brothers to older women as mothers to younger women as sisterswith absolute purity
6729,1TI,5,NRSV,honor widows who are really widows
6730,1TI,5,NRSV,if a widow has children or grandchildren they should first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some repayment to their parents for this is pleasing in gods sight
6731,1TI,5,NRSV,the real widow left alone has set her hope on god and continues in supplications and prayers night and day but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives
6732,1TI,5,NRSV,give these commands as well so that they may be above reproach
6733,1TI,5,NRSV,and whoever does not provide for relatives and especially for family members has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
6734,1TI,5,NRSV,let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once she must be well attested for her good works as one who has brought up children shown hospitality washed the saints feet helped the afflicted and devoted herself to doing good in every way
6735,1TI,5,NRSV,but refuse to put younger widows on the list for when their sensual desires alienate them from christ they want to marry and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge
6736,1TI,5,NRSV,besides that they learn to be idle gadding about from house to house and they are not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say
6737,1TI,5,NRSV,so i would have younger widows marry bear children and manage their households so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us
6738,1TI,5,NRSV,for some have already turned away to follow satan
6739,1TI,5,NRSV,if any believing woman has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows
6740,1TI,5,NRSV,let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor in preaching and teaching for the scripture says you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain and the laborer deserves to be paid
6741,1TI,5,NRSV,never accept any accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses
6742,1TI,5,NRSV,as for those who persist in sin rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest also may stand in fear
6743,1TI,5,NRSV,in the presence of god and of christ jesus and of the elect angels i warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice doing nothing on the basis of partiality
6744,1TI,5,NRSV,do not ordain anyone hastily and do not participate in the sins of others keep yourself pure
6745,1TI,5,NRSV,no longer drink only water but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments
6746,1TI,5,NRSV,the sins of some people are conspicuous and precede them to judgment while the sins of others follow them there
6747,1TI,5,NRSV,so also good works are conspicuous and even when they are not they cannot remain hidden
6748,1TI,6,NRSV,let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of god and the teaching may not be blasphemed
6749,1TI,6,NRSV,those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church rather they must serve them all the more since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved
6750,1TI,6,NRSV,teach and urge these duties
6751,1TI,6,NRSV,whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our lord jesus christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness is conceited understanding nothing and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words
6752,1TI,6,NRSV,from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain
6753,1TI,6,NRSV,of course there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment for we brought nothing into the world so that we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with these
6754,1TI,6,NRSV,but those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction
6755,1TI,6,NRSV,for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains
6756,1TI,6,NRSV,but as for you man of god shun all this pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance gentleness
6757,1TI,6,NRSV,fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses
6758,1TI,6,NRSV,in the presence of god who gives life to all things and of christ jesus who in his testimony before pontius pilate made the good confession i charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ which he will bring about at the right timehe who is the blessed and only sovereign the king of kings and lord of lords
6759,1TI,6,NRSV,it is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no one has ever seen or can see to him be honor and eternal dominion
6760,1TI,6,NRSV,amen
6761,1TI,6,NRSV,as for those who in the present age are rich command them not to be haughty or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but rather on god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment
6762,1TI,6,NRSV,they are to do good to be rich in good works generous and ready to share thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of the life that really is life
6763,1TI,6,NRSV,timothy guard what has been entrusted to you
6764,1TI,6,NRSV,avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith
6765,1TI,6,NRSV,grace be with you
6766,2TI,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god for the sake of the promise of life that is in christ jesus to timothy my beloved child grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
6767,2TI,1,NRSV,i am grateful to godwhom i worship with a clear conscience as my ancestors didwhen i remember you constantly in my prayers night and day
6768,2TI,1,NRSV,recalling your tears i long to see you so that i may be filled with joy
6769,2TI,1,NRSV,i am reminded of your sincere faith a faith that lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and now i am sure lives in you
6770,2TI,1,NRSV,for this reason i remind you to rekindle the gift of god that is within you through the laying on of my hands for god did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather a spirit of power and of love and of selfdiscipline
6771,2TI,1,NRSV,do not be ashamed then of the testimony about our lord or of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel relying on the power of god who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace
6772,2TI,1,NRSV,this grace was given to us in christ jesus before the ages began but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our savior christ jesus who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
6773,2TI,1,NRSV,for this gospel i was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher and for this reason i suffer as i do
6774,2TI,1,NRSV,but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him
6775,2TI,1,NRSV,hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me in the faith and love that are in christ jesus
6776,2TI,1,NRSV,guard the good treasure entrusted to you with the help of the holy spirit living in us
6777,2TI,1,NRSV,you are aware that all who are in asia have turned away from me including phygelus and hermogenes
6778,2TI,1,NRSV,may the lord grant mercy to the household of onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain when he arrived in rome he eagerly searched for me and found me may the lord grant that he will find mercy from the lord on that day and you know very well how much service he rendered in ephesus
6779,2TI,2,NRSV,you then my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well
6780,2TI,2,NRSV,share in suffering like a good soldier of christ jesus
6781,2TI,2,NRSV,no one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs the soldiers aim is to please the enlisting officer
6782,2TI,2,NRSV,and in the case of an athlete no one is crowned without competing according to the rules
6783,2TI,2,NRSV,it is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of the crops
6784,2TI,2,NRSV,think over what i say for the lord will give you understanding in all things
6785,2TI,2,NRSV,remember jesus christ raised from the dead a descendant of davidthat is my gospel for which i suffer hardship even to the point of being chained like a criminal
6786,2TI,2,NRSV,but the word of god is not chained
6787,2TI,2,NRSV,therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory
6788,2TI,2,NRSV,the saying is sure if we have died with him we will also live with him if we endure we will also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself
6789,2TI,2,NRSV,remind them of this and warn them before god that they are to avoid wrangling over words which does no good but only ruins those who are listening
6790,2TI,2,NRSV,do your best to present yourself to god as one approved by him a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly explaining the word of truth
6791,2TI,2,NRSV,avoid profane chatter for it will lead people into more and more impiety and their talk will spread like gangrene
6792,2TI,2,NRSV,among them are hymenaeus and philetus who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place
6793,2TI,2,NRSV,they are upsetting the faith of some
6794,2TI,2,NRSV,but gods firm foundation stands bearing this inscription the lord knows those who are his and let everyone who calls on the name of the lord turn away from wickedness
6795,2TI,2,NRSV,in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay some for special use some for ordinary
6796,2TI,2,NRSV,all who cleanse themselves of the things i have mentioned will become special utensils dedicated and useful to the owner of the house ready for every good work
6797,2TI,2,NRSV,shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord from a pure heart
6798,2TI,2,NRSV,have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies you know that they breed quarrels
6799,2TI,2,NRSV,and the lords servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone an apt teacher patient correcting opponents with gentleness
6800,2TI,2,NRSV,god may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth and that they may escape from the snare of the devil having been held captive by him to do his will
6801,2TI,3,NRSV,you must understand this that in the last days distressing times will come
6802,2TI,3,NRSV,for people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boasters arrogant abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy inhuman implacable slanderers profligates brutes haters of good treacherous reckless swollen with conceit lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power
6803,2TI,3,NRSV,avoid them for among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth
6804,2TI,3,NRSV,as jannes and jambres opposed moses so these people of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith also oppose the truth
6805,2TI,3,NRSV,but they will not make much progress because as in the case of those two men their folly will become plain to everyone
6806,2TI,3,NRSV,now you have observed my teaching my conduct my aim in life my faith my patience my love my steadfastness my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in antioch iconium and lystra
6807,2TI,3,NRSV,what persecutions i endured yet the lord rescued me from all of them
6808,2TI,3,NRSV,indeed all who want to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted
6809,2TI,3,NRSV,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived
6810,2TI,3,NRSV,but as for you continue in what you have learned and firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in christ jesus
6811,2TI,3,NRSV,all scripture is inspired by god and is useful for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness so that everyone who belongs to god may be proficient equipped for every good work
6812,2TI,4,NRSV,in the presence of god and of christ jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom i solemnly urge you proclaim the message be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable convince rebuke and encourage with the utmost patience in teaching
6813,2TI,4,NRSV,for the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths
6814,2TI,4,NRSV,as for you always be sober endure suffering do the work of an evangelist carry out your ministry fully
6815,2TI,4,NRSV,as for me i am already being poured out as a libation and the time of my departure has come
6816,2TI,4,NRSV,i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
6817,2TI,4,NRSV,from now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing
6818,2TI,4,NRSV,do your best to come to me soon for demas in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia titus to dalmatia
6819,2TI,4,NRSV,only luke is with me
6820,2TI,4,NRSV,get mark and bring him with you for he is useful in my ministry
6821,2TI,4,NRSV,i have sent tychicus to ephesus
6822,2TI,4,NRSV,when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas also the books and above all the parchments
6823,2TI,4,NRSV,alexander the coppersmith did me great harm the lord will pay him back for his deeds
6824,2TI,4,NRSV,you also must beware of him for he strongly opposed our message
6825,2TI,4,NRSV,at my first defense no one came to my support but all deserted me
6826,2TI,4,NRSV,may it not be counted against them but the lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the gentiles might hear it
6827,2TI,4,NRSV,so i was rescued from the lions mouth
6828,2TI,4,NRSV,the lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom
6829,2TI,4,NRSV,to him be the glory forever and ever
6830,2TI,4,NRSV,amen
6831,2TI,4,NRSV,greet prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus
6832,2TI,4,NRSV,erastus remained in corinth trophimus i left ill in miletus
6833,2TI,4,NRSV,do your best to come before winter
6834,2TI,4,NRSV,eubulus sends greetings to you as do pudens and linus and claudia and all the brothers and sisters
6835,2TI,4,NRSV,the lord be with your spirit
6836,2TI,4,NRSV,grace be with you
6837,TIT,1,NRSV,paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ for the sake of the faith of gods elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness in the hope of eternal life that god who never lies promised before the ages began in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which i have been entrusted by the command of god our savior to titus my loyal child in the faith we share grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior
6838,TIT,1,NRSV,i left you behind in crete for this reason so that you should put in order what remained to be done and should appoint elders in every town as i directed you someone who is blameless married only once whose children are believers not accused of debauchery and not rebellious
6839,TIT,1,NRSV,for a bishop as gods steward must be blameless he must not be arrogant or quicktempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain but he must be hospitable a lover of goodness prudent upright devout and selfcontrolled
6840,TIT,1,NRSV,he must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it
6841,TIT,1,NRSV,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach
6842,TIT,1,NRSV,it was one of them their very own prophet who said cretans are always liars vicious brutes lazy gluttons
6843,TIT,1,NRSV,that testimony is true
6844,TIT,1,NRSV,for this reason rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith not paying attention to jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth
6845,TIT,1,NRSV,to the pure all things are pure but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure
6846,TIT,1,NRSV,their very minds and consciences are corrupted
6847,TIT,1,NRSV,they profess to know god but they deny him by their actions
6848,TIT,1,NRSV,they are detestable disobedient unfit for any good work
6849,TIT,2,NRSV,but as for you teach what is consistent with sound doctrine
6850,TIT,2,NRSV,tell the older men to be temperate serious prudent and sound in faith in love and in endurance
6851,TIT,2,NRSV,likewise tell the older women to be reverent in behavior not to be slanderers or slaves to drink they are to teach what is good so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children to be selfcontrolled chaste good managers of the household kind being submissive to their husbands so that the word of god may not be discredited
6852,TIT,2,NRSV,likewise urge the younger men to be selfcontrolled
6853,TIT,2,NRSV,show yourself in all respects a model of good works and in your teaching show integrity gravity and sound speech that cannot be censured then any opponent will be put to shame having nothing evil to say of us
6854,TIT,2,NRSV,tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect they are not to talk back not to pilfer but to show complete and perfect fidelity so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of god our savior
6855,TIT,2,NRSV,for the grace of god has appeared bringing salvation to all training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions and in the present age to live lives that are selfcontrolled upright and godly while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ
6856,TIT,2,NRSV,he it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds
6857,TIT,2,NRSV,declare these things exhort and reprove with all authority
6858,TIT,2,NRSV,let no one look down on you
6859,TIT,3,NRSV,remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show every courtesy to everyone
6860,TIT,3,NRSV,for we ourselves were once foolish disobedient led astray slaves to various passions and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy despicable hating one another
6861,TIT,3,NRSV,but when the goodness and loving kindness of god our savior appeared he saved us not because of any works of righteousness that we had done but according to his mercy through the water of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit
6862,TIT,3,NRSV,this spirit he poured out on us richly through jesus christ our savior so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life
6863,TIT,3,NRSV,the saying is sure
6864,TIT,3,NRSV,i desire that you insist on these things so that those who have come to believe in god may be careful to devote themselves to good works these things are excellent and profitable to everyone
6865,TIT,3,NRSV,but avoid stupid controversies genealogies dissensions and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable and worthless
6866,TIT,3,NRSV,after a first and second admonition have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful being selfcondemned
6867,TIT,3,NRSV,when i send artemas to you or tychicus do your best to come to me at nicopolis for i have decided to spend the winter there
6868,TIT,3,NRSV,make every effort to send zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way and see that they lack nothing
6869,TIT,3,NRSV,and let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs so that they may not be unproductive
6870,TIT,3,NRSV,all who are with me send greetings to you
6871,TIT,3,NRSV,greet those who love us in the faith
6872,TIT,3,NRSV,grace be with all of you
6873,PHM,1,NRSV,paul a prisoner of christ jesus and timothy our brother to philemon our dear friend and coworker to apphia our sister to archippus our fellow soldier and to the church in your house grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
6874,PHM,1,NRSV,when i remember you in my prayers i always thank my god because i hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the lord jesus
6875,PHM,1,NRSV,i pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for christ
6876,PHM,1,NRSV,i have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you my brother
6877,PHM,1,NRSV,for this reason though i am bold enough in christ to command you to do your duty yet i would rather appeal to you on the basis of loveand i paul do this as an old man and now also as a prisoner of christ jesus
6878,PHM,1,NRSV,i am appealing to you for my child onesimus whose father i have become during my imprisonment
6879,PHM,1,NRSV,formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me
6880,PHM,1,NRSV,i am sending him that is my own heart back to you
6881,PHM,1,NRSV,i wanted to keep him with me so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel but i preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced
6882,PHM,1,NRSV,perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brotherespecially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the lord
6883,PHM,1,NRSV,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me
6884,PHM,1,NRSV,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account
6885,PHM,1,NRSV,i paul am writing this with my own hand i will repay it
6886,PHM,1,NRSV,i say nothing about your owing me even your own self
6887,PHM,1,NRSV,yes brother let me have this benefit from you in the lord refresh my heart in christ
6888,PHM,1,NRSV,confident of your obedience i am writing to you knowing that you will do even more than i say
6889,PHM,1,NRSV,one thing moreprepare a guest room for me for i am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you
6890,PHM,1,NRSV,epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus sends greetings to you and so do mark aristarchus demas and luke my fellow workers
6891,PHM,1,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit
6892,HEB,1,NRSV,long ago god spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken to us by a son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom he also created the worlds
6893,HEB,1,NRSV,he is the reflection of gods glory and the exact imprint of gods very being and he sustains all things by his powerful word
6894,HEB,1,NRSV,when he had made purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs
6895,HEB,1,NRSV,for to which of the angels did god ever say you are my son today i have begotten you
6896,HEB,1,NRSV,or again i will be his father and he will be my son
6897,HEB,1,NRSV,and again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says let all gods angels worship him
6898,HEB,1,NRSV,of the angels he says he makes his angels winds and his servants flames of fire
6899,HEB,1,NRSV,but of the son he says your throne o god is forever and ever and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom
6900,HEB,1,NRSV,you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions
6901,HEB,1,NRSV,and in the beginning lord you founded the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands they will perish but you remain they will all wear out like clothing like a cloak you will roll them up and like clothing they will be changed
6902,HEB,1,NRSV,but you are the same and your years will never end
6903,HEB,1,NRSV,but to which of the angels has he ever said sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet
6904,HEB,1,NRSV,are not all angels spirits in the divine service sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation
6905,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it
6906,HEB,2,NRSV,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation
6907,HEB,2,NRSV,it was declared at first through the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard him while god added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will
6908,HEB,2,NRSV,now god did not subject the coming world about which we are speaking to angels
6909,HEB,2,NRSV,but someone has testified somewhere what are human beings that you are mindful of them or mortals that you care for them
6910,HEB,2,NRSV,you have made them for a little while lower than the angels you have crowned them with glory and honor subjecting all things under their feet
6911,HEB,2,NRSV,now in subjecting all things to them god left nothing outside their control
6912,HEB,2,NRSV,as it is we do not yet see everything in subjection to them but we do see jesus who for a little while was made lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of god he might taste death for everyone
6913,HEB,2,NRSV,it was fitting that god for whom and through whom all things exist in bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings
6914,HEB,2,NRSV,for the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one father
6915,HEB,2,NRSV,for this reason jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters saying i will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters in the midst of the congregation i will praise you
6916,HEB,2,NRSV,and again i will put my trust in him
6917,HEB,2,NRSV,and again here am i and the children whom god has given me
6918,HEB,2,NRSV,since therefore the children share flesh and blood he himself likewise shared the same things so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death
6919,HEB,2,NRSV,for it is clear that he did not come to help angels but the descendants of abraham
6920,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of god to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people
6921,HEB,2,NRSV,because he himself was tested by what he suffered he is able to help those who are being tested
6922,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore brothers and sisters holy partners in a heavenly calling consider that jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession was faithful to the one who appointed him just as moses also was faithful in all gods house
6923,HEB,3,NRSV,yet jesus is worthy of more glory than moses just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself
6924,HEB,3,NRSV,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god now moses was faithful in all gods house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later
6925,HEB,3,NRSV,christ however was faithful over gods house as a son and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope
6926,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion as on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors put me to the test though they had seen my works for forty years
6927,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore i was angry with that generation and i said they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways
6928,HEB,3,NRSV,as in my anger i swore they will not enter my rest
6929,HEB,3,NRSV,take care brothers and sisters that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god
6930,HEB,3,NRSV,but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin
6931,HEB,3,NRSV,for we have become partners of christ if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end
6932,HEB,3,NRSV,as it is said today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion
6933,HEB,3,NRSV,now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious
6934,HEB,3,NRSV,was it not all those who left egypt under the leadership of moses
6935,HEB,3,NRSV,but with whom was he angry forty years
6936,HEB,3,NRSV,was it not those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness
6937,HEB,3,NRSV,and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if not to those who were disobedient
6938,HEB,3,NRSV,so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief
6939,HEB,4,NRSV,therefore while the promise of entering his rest is still open let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it
6940,HEB,4,NRSV,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened
6941,HEB,4,NRSV,for we who have believed enter that rest just as god has said as in my anger i swore they shall not enter my rest though his works were finished at the foundation of the world
6942,HEB,4,NRSV,for in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows and god rested on the seventh day from all his works
6943,HEB,4,NRSV,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest
6944,HEB,4,NRSV,since therefore it remains open for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience again he sets a certain daytodaysaying through david much later in the words already quoted today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts
6945,HEB,4,NRSV,for if joshua had given them rest god would not speak later about another day
6946,HEB,4,NRSV,so then a sabbath rest still remains for the people of god for those who enter gods rest also cease from their labors as god did from his
6947,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs
6948,HEB,4,NRSV,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart
6949,HEB,4,NRSV,and before him no creature is hidden but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account
6950,HEB,4,NRSV,since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our confession
6951,HEB,4,NRSV,for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are yet without sin
6952,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need
6953,HEB,5,NRSV,every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to god on their behalf to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins
6954,HEB,5,NRSV,he is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is subject to weakness and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people
6955,HEB,5,NRSV,and one does not presume to take this honor but takes it only when called by god just as aaron was
6956,HEB,5,NRSV,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he says also in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
6957,HEB,5,NRSV,in the days of his flesh jesus offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission
6958,HEB,5,NRSV,although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered and having been made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him having been designated by god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek
6959,HEB,5,NRSV,about this we have much to say that is hard to explain since you have become dull in understanding
6960,HEB,5,NRSV,for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of god
6961,HEB,5,NRSV,you need milk not solid food for everyone who lives on milk being still an infant is unskilled in the word of righteousness
6962,HEB,5,NRSV,but solid food is for the mature for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil
6963,HEB,6,NRSV,therefore let us go on toward perfection leaving behind the basic teaching about christ and not laying again the foundation repentance from dead works and faith toward god instruction about baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment
6964,HEB,6,NRSV,and we will do this if god permits
6965,HEB,6,NRSV,for it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the holy spirit and have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the age to come and then have fallen away since on their own they are crucifying again the son of god and are holding him up to contempt
6966,HEB,6,NRSV,ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from god
6967,HEB,6,NRSV,but if it produces thorns and thistles it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed its end is to be burned over
6968,HEB,6,NRSV,even though we speak in this way beloved we are confident of better things in your case things that belong to salvation
6969,HEB,6,NRSV,for god is not unjust he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints as you still do
6970,HEB,6,NRSV,and we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end so that you may not become sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises
6971,HEB,6,NRSV,when god made a promise to abraham because he had no one greater by whom to swear he swore by himself saying i will surely bless you and multiply you
6972,HEB,6,NRSV,and thus abraham having patiently endured obtained the promise
6973,HEB,6,NRSV,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute
6974,HEB,6,NRSV,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us
6975,HEB,6,NRSV,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
6976,HEB,7,NRSV,this king melchizedek of salem priest of the most high god met abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him and to him abraham apportioned onetenth of everything
6977,HEB,7,NRSV,his name in the first place means king of righteousness next he is also king of salem that is king of peace
6978,HEB,7,NRSV,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever
6979,HEB,7,NRSV,see how great he is even abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils
6980,HEB,7,NRSV,and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people that is from their kindred though these also are descended from abraham
6981,HEB,7,NRSV,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises
6982,HEB,7,NRSV,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior
6983,HEB,7,NRSV,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives
6984,HEB,7,NRSV,one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him
6985,HEB,7,NRSV,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron
6986,HEB,7,NRSV,for when there is a change in the priesthood there is necessarily a change in the law as well
6987,HEB,7,NRSV,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar
6988,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is evident that our lord was descended from judah and in connection with that tribe moses said nothing about priests
6989,HEB,7,NRSV,it is even more obvious when another priest arises resembling melchizedek one who has become a priest not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life
6990,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is attested of him you are a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
6991,HEB,7,NRSV,there is on the one hand the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual for the law made nothing perfect there is on the other hand the introduction of a better hope through which we approach god
6992,HEB,7,NRSV,this was confirmed with an oath for others who became priests took their office without an oath but this one became a priest with an oath because of the one who said to him the lord has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever accordingly jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant
6993,HEB,7,NRSV,furthermore the former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office but he holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever
6994,HEB,7,NRSV,consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them
6995,HEB,7,NRSV,for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy blameless undefiled separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens
6996,HEB,7,NRSV,unlike the other high priests he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for those of the people this he did once for all when he offered himself
6997,HEB,7,NRSV,for the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness but the word of the oath which came later than the law appoints a son who has been made perfect forever
6998,HEB,8,NRSV,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up
6999,HEB,8,NRSV,for every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer
7000,HEB,8,NRSV,now if he were on earth he would not be a priest at all since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law
7001,HEB,8,NRSV,they offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain
7002,HEB,8,NRSV,but jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted through better promises
7003,HEB,8,NRSV,for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no need to look for a second one
7004,HEB,8,NRSV,god finds fault with them when he says the days are surely coming says the lord when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not like the covenant that i made with their ancestors on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt for they did not continue in my covenant and so i had no concern for them says the lord
7005,HEB,8,NRSV,this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people
7006,HEB,8,NRSV,and they shall not teach one another or say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest
7007,HEB,8,NRSV,for i will be merciful toward their iniquities and i will remember their sins no more
7008,HEB,8,NRSV,in speaking of a new covenant he has made the first one obsolete
7009,HEB,8,NRSV,and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear
7010,HEB,9,NRSV,now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary
7011,HEB,9,NRSV,for a tent was constructed the first one in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence this is called the holy place
7012,HEB,9,NRSV,behind the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies
7013,HEB,9,NRSV,in it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold in which there were a golden urn holding the manna and aarons rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat
7014,HEB,9,NRSV,of these things we cannot speak now in detail
7015,HEB,9,NRSV,such preparations having been made the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties but only the high priest goes into the second and he but once a year and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people
7016,HEB,9,NRSV,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing
7017,HEB,9,NRSV,this is a symbol of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right
7018,HEB,9,NRSV,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption
7019,HEB,9,NRSV,for if the blood of goats and bulls with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified how much more will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to god purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living god for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant
7020,HEB,9,NRSV,where a will is involved the death of the one who made it must be established
7021,HEB,9,NRSV,for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive
7022,HEB,9,NRSV,hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood
7023,HEB,9,NRSV,for when every commandment had been told to all the people by moses in accordance with the law he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people saying this is the blood of the covenant that god has ordained for you
7024,HEB,9,NRSV,and in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship
7025,HEB,9,NRSV,indeed under the law almost everything is purified with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins
7026,HEB,9,NRSV,thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices than these
7027,HEB,9,NRSV,for christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands a mere copy of the true one but he entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god on our behalf
7028,HEB,9,NRSV,nor was it to offer himself again and again as the high priest enters the holy place year after year with blood that is not his own for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world
7029,HEB,9,NRSV,but as it is he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself
7030,HEB,9,NRSV,and just as it is appointed for mortals to die once and after that the judgment so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him
7031,HEB,10,NRSV,since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities it can never by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year make perfect those who approach
7032,HEB,10,NRSV,otherwise would they not have ceased being offered since the worshipers cleansed once for all would no longer have any consciousness of sin
7033,HEB,10,NRSV,but in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year
7034,HEB,10,NRSV,for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins
7035,HEB,10,NRSV,consequently when christ came into the world he said sacrifices and offerings you have not desired but a body you have prepared for me in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure
7036,HEB,10,NRSV,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god in the scroll of the book it is written of me
7037,HEB,10,NRSV,when he said above you have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings these are offered according to the law then he added see i have come to do your will
7038,HEB,10,NRSV,he abolishes the first in order to establish the second
7039,HEB,10,NRSV,and it is by gods will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all
7040,HEB,10,NRSV,and every priest stands day after day at his service offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins
7041,HEB,10,NRSV,but when christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of god and since then has been waiting until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet
7042,HEB,10,NRSV,for by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified
7043,HEB,10,NRSV,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds he also adds i will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more
7044,HEB,10,NRSV,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin
7045,HEB,10,NRSV,therefore my friends since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of jesus by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh and since we have a great priest over the house of god let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
7046,HEB,10,NRSV,let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering for he who has promised is faithful
7047,HEB,10,NRSV,and let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching
7048,HEB,10,NRSV,for if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries
7049,HEB,10,NRSV,anyone who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses
7050,HEB,10,NRSV,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace
7051,HEB,10,NRSV,for we know the one who said vengeance is mine i will repay
7052,HEB,10,NRSV,and again the lord will judge his people
7053,HEB,10,NRSV,it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
7054,HEB,10,NRSV,but recall those earlier days when after you had been enlightened you endured a hard struggle with sufferings sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution and sometimes being partners with those so treated
7055,HEB,10,NRSV,for you had compassion for those who were in prison and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting
7056,HEB,10,NRSV,do not therefore abandon that confidence of yours it brings a great reward
7057,HEB,10,NRSV,for you need endurance so that when you have done the will of god you may receive what was promised
7058,HEB,10,NRSV,for yet in a very little while the one who is coming will come and will not delay but my righteous one will live by faith
7059,HEB,10,NRSV,my soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back
7060,HEB,10,NRSV,but we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost but among those who have faith and so are saved
7061,HEB,11,NRSV,now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
7062,HEB,11,NRSV,indeed by faith our ancestors received approval
7063,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of god so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible
7064,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abel offered to god a more acceptable sacrifice than cains
7065,HEB,11,NRSV,through this he received approval as righteous god himself giving approval to his gifts he died but through his faith he still speaks
7066,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith enoch was taken so that he did not experience death and he was not found because god had taken him
7067,HEB,11,NRSV,for it was attested before he was taken away that he had pleased god
7068,HEB,11,NRSV,and without faith it is impossible to please god for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him
7069,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith noah warned by god about events as yet unseen respected the warning and built an ark to save his household by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith
7070,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance and he set out not knowing where he was going
7071,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised as in a foreign land living in tents as did isaac and jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise
7072,HEB,11,NRSV,for he looked forward to the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is god
7073,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he received power of procreation even though he was too oldand sarah herself was barrenbecause he considered him faithful who had promised
7074,HEB,11,NRSV,therefore from one person and this one as good as dead descendants were born as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore
7075,HEB,11,NRSV,all of these died in faith without having received the promises but from a distance they saw and greeted them
7076,HEB,11,NRSV,they confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland
7077,HEB,11,NRSV,if they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind they would have had opportunity to return
7078,HEB,11,NRSV,but as it is they desire a better country that is a heavenly one
7079,HEB,11,NRSV,therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god indeed he has prepared a city for them
7080,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abraham when put to the test offered up isaac
7081,HEB,11,NRSV,he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son of whom he had been told it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you
7082,HEB,11,NRSV,he considered the fact that god is able even to raise someone from the deadand figuratively speaking he did receive him back
7083,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith isaac invoked blessings for the future on jacob and esau
7084,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of joseph bowing in worship over the top of his staff
7085,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith joseph at the end of his life made mention of the exodus of the israelites and gave instructions about his burial
7086,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth because they saw that the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the kings edict
7087,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith moses when he was grown up refused to be called a son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to share illtreatment with the people of god than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin
7088,HEB,11,NRSV,he considered abuse suffered for the christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of egypt for he was looking ahead to the reward
7089,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he left egypt unafraid of the kings anger for he persevered as though he saw him who is invisible
7090,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of israel
7091,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith the people passed through the red sea as if it were dry land but when the egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned
7092,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith the walls of jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days
7093,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient because she had received the spies in peace
7094,HEB,11,NRSV,and what more should i say
7095,HEB,11,NRSV,for time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice obtained promises shut the mouths of lions quenched raging fire escaped the edge of the sword won strength out of weakness became mighty in war put foreign armies to flight
7096,HEB,11,NRSV,women received their dead by resurrection
7097,HEB,11,NRSV,others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection
7098,HEB,11,NRSV,others suffered mocking and flogging and even chains and imprisonment
7099,HEB,11,NRSV,they were stoned to death they were sawn in two they were killed by the sword they went about in skins of sheep and goats destitute persecuted tormented of whom the world was not worthy
7100,HEB,11,NRSV,they wandered in deserts and mountains and in caves and holes in the ground
7101,HEB,11,NRSV,yet all these though they were commended for their faith did not receive what was promised since god had provided something better so that they would not apart from us be made perfect
7102,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god
7103,HEB,12,NRSV,consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners so that you may not grow weary or lose heart
7104,HEB,12,NRSV,in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood
7105,HEB,12,NRSV,and you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children my child do not regard lightly the discipline of the lord or lose heart when you are punished by him for the lord disciplines those whom he loves and chastises every child whom he accepts
7106,HEB,12,NRSV,endure trials for the sake of discipline
7107,HEB,12,NRSV,god is treating you as children for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline
7108,HEB,12,NRSV,if you do not have that discipline in which all children share then you are illegitimate and not his children
7109,HEB,12,NRSV,moreover we had human parents to discipline us and we respected them
7110,HEB,12,NRSV,should we not be even more willing to be subject to the father of spirits and live
7111,HEB,12,NRSV,for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good in order that we may share his holiness
7112,HEB,12,NRSV,now discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it
7113,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed
7114,HEB,12,NRSV,pursue peace with everyone and the holiness without which no one will see the lord
7115,HEB,12,NRSV,see to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of god that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble and through it many become defiled
7116,HEB,12,NRSV,see to it that no one becomes like esau an immoral and godless person who sold his birthright for a single meal
7117,HEB,12,NRSV,you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent even though he sought the blessing with tears
7118,HEB,12,NRSV,you have not come to something that can be touched a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them
7119,HEB,12,NRSV,for they could not endure the order that was given if even an animal touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death
7120,HEB,12,NRSV,indeed so terrifying was the sight that moses said i tremble with fear but you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel
7121,HEB,12,NRSV,see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven
7122,HEB,12,NRSV,this phrase yet once more indicates the removal of what is shakenthat is created thingsso that what cannot be shaken may remain
7123,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us give thanks by which we offer to god an acceptable worship with reverence and awe for indeed our god is a consuming fire
7124,HEB,13,NRSV,let mutual love continue
7125,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it
7126,HEB,13,NRSV,remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with them those who are being tortured as though you yourselves were being tortured
7127,HEB,13,NRSV,let marriage be held in honor by all and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled for god will judge fornicators and adulterers
7128,HEB,13,NRSV,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you
7129,HEB,13,NRSV,so we can say with confidence the lord is my helper i will not be afraid
7130,HEB,13,NRSV,what can anyone do to me
7131,HEB,13,NRSV,remember your leaders those who spoke the word of god to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith
7132,HEB,13,NRSV,jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
7133,HEB,13,NRSV,do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings for it is well for the heart to be strengthened by grace not by regulations about food which have not benefited those who observe them
7134,HEB,13,NRSV,we have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right to eat
7135,HEB,13,NRSV,for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp
7136,HEB,13,NRSV,therefore jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood
7137,HEB,13,NRSV,let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured
7138,HEB,13,NRSV,for here we have no lasting city but we are looking for the city that is to come
7139,HEB,13,NRSV,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name
7140,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to god
7141,HEB,13,NRSV,obey your leaders and submit to them for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account
7142,HEB,13,NRSV,let them do this with joy and not with sighingfor that would be harmful to you
7143,HEB,13,NRSV,pray for us we are sure that we have a clear conscience desiring to act honorably in all things
7144,HEB,13,NRSV,i urge you all the more to do this so that i may be restored to you very soon
7145,HEB,13,NRSV,now may the god of peace who brought back from the dead our lord jesus the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of the eternal covenant make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will working among us that which is pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever and ever
7146,HEB,13,NRSV,amen
7147,HEB,13,NRSV,i appeal to you brothers and sisters bear with my word of exhortation for i have written to you briefly
7148,HEB,13,NRSV,i want you to know that our brother timothy has been set free and if he comes in time he will be with me when i see you
7149,HEB,13,NRSV,greet all your leaders and all the saints
7150,HEB,13,NRSV,those from italy send you greetings
7151,HEB,13,NRSV,grace be with all of you
7152,JAS,1,NRSV,james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes in the dispersion greetings
7153,JAS,1,NRSV,my brothers and sisters whenever you face trials of any kind consider it nothing but joy because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its full effect so that you may be mature and complete lacking in nothing
7154,JAS,1,NRSV,if any of you is lacking in wisdom ask god who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly and it will be given you
7155,JAS,1,NRSV,but ask in faith never doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind for the doubter being doubleminded and unstable in every way must not expect to receive anything from the lord
7156,JAS,1,NRSV,let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up and the rich in being brought low because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field
7157,JAS,1,NRSV,for the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field its flower falls and its beauty perishes
7158,JAS,1,NRSV,it is the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life they will wither away
7159,JAS,1,NRSV,blessed is anyone who endures temptation
7160,JAS,1,NRSV,such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him
7161,JAS,1,NRSV,no one when tempted should say i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one
7162,JAS,1,NRSV,but one is tempted by ones own desire being lured and enticed by it then when that desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and that sin when it is fully grown gives birth to death
7163,JAS,1,NRSV,do not be deceived my beloved
7164,JAS,1,NRSV,every generous act of giving with every perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change
7165,JAS,1,NRSV,in fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures
7166,JAS,1,NRSV,you must understand this my beloved let everyone be quick to listen slow to speak slow to anger for your anger does not produce gods righteousness
7167,JAS,1,NRSV,therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls
7168,JAS,1,NRSV,but be doers of the word and not merely hearers who deceive themselves
7169,JAS,1,NRSV,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like
7170,JAS,1,NRSV,but those who look into the perfect law the law of liberty and persevere being not hearers who forget but doers who actthey will be blessed in their doing
7171,JAS,1,NRSV,if any think they are religious and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts their religion is worthless
7172,JAS,1,NRSV,religion that is pure and undefiled before god the father is this to care for orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world
7173,JAS,2,NRSV,my brothers and sisters do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious lord jesus christ
7174,JAS,2,NRSV,for if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say have a seat here please while to the one who is poor you say stand there or sit at my feet have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts
7175,JAS,2,NRSV,listen my beloved brothers and sisters
7176,JAS,2,NRSV,has not god chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him
7177,JAS,2,NRSV,but you have dishonored the poor
7178,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not the rich who oppress you
7179,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not they who drag you into court
7180,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you
7181,JAS,2,NRSV,you do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture you shall love your neighbor as yourself
7182,JAS,2,NRSV,but if you show partiality you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors
7183,JAS,2,NRSV,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it
7184,JAS,2,NRSV,for the one who said you shall not commit adultery also said you shall not murder
7185,JAS,2,NRSV,now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder you have become a transgressor of the law
7186,JAS,2,NRSV,so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty
7187,JAS,2,NRSV,for judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy mercy triumphs over judgment
7188,JAS,2,NRSV,what good is it my brothers and sisters if you say you have faith but do not have works
7189,JAS,2,NRSV,can faith save you
7190,JAS,2,NRSV,if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food and one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and eat your fill and yet you do not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that
7191,JAS,2,NRSV,so faith by itself if it has no works is dead
7192,JAS,2,NRSV,but someone will say you have faith and i have works
7193,JAS,2,NRSV,show me your faith apart from your works and i by my works will show you my faith
7194,JAS,2,NRSV,you believe that god is one you do well
7195,JAS,2,NRSV,even the demons believeand shudder
7196,JAS,2,NRSV,do you want to be shown you senseless person that faith apart from works is barren
7197,JAS,2,NRSV,was not our ancestor abraham justified by works when he offered his son isaac on the altar
7198,JAS,2,NRSV,you see that faith was active along with his works and faith was brought to completion by the works
7199,JAS,2,NRSV,thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god
7200,JAS,2,NRSV,you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone
7201,JAS,2,NRSV,likewise was not rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road
7202,JAS,2,NRSV,for just as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is also dead
7203,JAS,3,NRSV,not many of you should become teachers my brothers and sisters for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness
7204,JAS,3,NRSV,for all of us make many mistakes
7205,JAS,3,NRSV,anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle
7206,JAS,3,NRSV,if we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we guide their whole bodies
7207,JAS,3,NRSV,or look at ships though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs
7208,JAS,3,NRSV,so also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great exploits
7209,JAS,3,NRSV,how great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire and the tongue is a fire
7210,JAS,3,NRSV,the tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity it stains the whole body sets on fire the cycle of nature and is itself set on fire by hell
7211,JAS,3,NRSV,for every species of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species but no one can tame the tonguea restless evil full of deadly poison
7212,JAS,3,NRSV,with it we bless the lord and father and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of god
7213,JAS,3,NRSV,from the same mouth come blessing and cursing
7214,JAS,3,NRSV,my brothers and sisters this ought not to be so
7215,JAS,3,NRSV,does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water
7216,JAS,3,NRSV,can a fig tree my brothers and sisters yield olives or a grapevine figs
7217,JAS,3,NRSV,no more can salt water yield fresh
7218,JAS,3,NRSV,who is wise and understanding among you
7219,JAS,3,NRSV,show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom
7220,JAS,3,NRSV,but if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not be boastful and false to the truth
7221,JAS,3,NRSV,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish
7222,JAS,3,NRSV,for where there is envy and selfish ambition there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind
7223,JAS,3,NRSV,but the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable gentle willing to yield full of mercy and good fruits without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy
7224,JAS,3,NRSV,and a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace
7225,JAS,4,NRSV,those conflicts and disputes among you where do they come from
7226,JAS,4,NRSV,do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you
7227,JAS,4,NRSV,you want something and do not have it so you commit murder
7228,JAS,4,NRSV,and you covet something and cannot obtain it so you engage in disputes and conflicts
7229,JAS,4,NRSV,you do not have because you do not ask
7230,JAS,4,NRSV,you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly in order to spend what you get on your pleasures
7231,JAS,4,NRSV,adulterers do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god
7232,JAS,4,NRSV,therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god
7233,JAS,4,NRSV,or do you suppose that it is for nothing that the scripture says god yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us
7234,JAS,4,NRSV,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
7235,JAS,4,NRSV,submit yourselves therefore to god
7236,JAS,4,NRSV,resist the devil and he will flee from you
7237,JAS,4,NRSV,draw near to god and he will draw near to you
7238,JAS,4,NRSV,cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doubleminded
7239,JAS,4,NRSV,lament and mourn and weep
7240,JAS,4,NRSV,let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection
7241,JAS,4,NRSV,humble yourselves before the lord and he will exalt you
7242,JAS,4,NRSV,do not speak evil against one another brothers and sisters
7243,JAS,4,NRSV,whoever speaks evil against another or judges another speaks evil against the law and judges the law but if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge
7244,JAS,4,NRSV,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy
7245,JAS,4,NRSV,so who then are you to judge your neighbor
7246,JAS,4,NRSV,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money
7247,JAS,4,NRSV,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring
7248,JAS,4,NRSV,what is your life
7249,JAS,4,NRSV,for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes
7250,JAS,4,NRSV,instead you ought to say if the lord wishes we will live and do this or that
7251,JAS,4,NRSV,as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil
7252,JAS,4,NRSV,anyone then who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it commits sin
7253,JAS,5,NRSV,come now you rich people weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you
7254,JAS,5,NRSV,your riches have rotted and your clothes are motheaten
7255,JAS,5,NRSV,your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be evidence against you and it will eat your flesh like fire
7256,JAS,5,NRSV,you have laid up treasure for the last days
7257,JAS,5,NRSV,listen the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you kept back by fraud cry out and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts
7258,JAS,5,NRSV,you have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter
7259,JAS,5,NRSV,you have condemned and murdered the righteous one who does not resist you
7260,JAS,5,NRSV,be patient therefore beloved until the coming of the lord
7261,JAS,5,NRSV,the farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains
7262,JAS,5,NRSV,you also must be patient
7263,JAS,5,NRSV,strengthen your hearts for the coming of the lord is near
7264,JAS,5,NRSV,beloved do not grumble against one another so that you may not be judged
7265,JAS,5,NRSV,see the judge is standing at the doors as an example of suffering and patience beloved take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord
7266,JAS,5,NRSV,indeed we call blessed those who showed endurance
7267,JAS,5,NRSV,you have heard of the endurance of job and you have seen the purpose of the lord how the lord is compassionate and merciful
7268,JAS,5,NRSV,above all my beloved do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath but let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not fall under condemnation
7269,JAS,5,NRSV,are any among you suffering
7270,JAS,5,NRSV,they should pray
7271,JAS,5,NRSV,are any cheerful
7272,JAS,5,NRSV,they should sing songs of praise
7273,JAS,5,NRSV,are any among you sick
7274,JAS,5,NRSV,they should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them anointing them with oil in the name of the lord
7275,JAS,5,NRSV,the prayer of faith will save the sick and the lord will raise them up and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven
7276,JAS,5,NRSV,therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed
7277,JAS,5,NRSV,the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective
7278,JAS,5,NRSV,elijah was a human being like us and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth
7279,JAS,5,NRSV,then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest
7280,JAS,5,NRSV,my brothers and sisters if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinners soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins
7281,1PE,1,NRSV,peter an apostle of jesus christ to the exiles of the dispersion in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia who have been chosen and destined by god the father and sanctified by the spirit to be obedient to jesus christ and to be sprinkled with his blood may grace and peace be yours in abundance
7282,1PE,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ by his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead and into an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you who are being protected by the power of god through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
7283,1PE,1,NRSV,in this you rejoice even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more precious than gold that though perishable is tested by firemay be found to result in praise and glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed
7284,1PE,1,NRSV,although you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy for you are receiving the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls
7285,1PE,1,NRSV,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory
7286,1PE,1,NRSV,it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who brought you good news by the holy spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look therefore prepare your minds for action discipline yourselves set all your hope on the grace that jesus christ will bring you when he is revealed
7287,1PE,1,NRSV,like obedient children do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance
7288,1PE,1,NRSV,instead as he who called you is holy be holy yourselves in all your conduct for it is written you shall be holy for i am holy
7289,1PE,1,NRSV,if you invoke as father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds live in reverent fear during the time of your exile
7290,1PE,1,NRSV,you know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors not with perishable things like silver or gold but with the precious blood of christ like that of a lamb without defect or blemish
7291,1PE,1,NRSV,he was destined before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake
7292,1PE,1,NRSV,through him you have come to trust in god who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are set on god
7293,1PE,1,NRSV,now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love love one another deeply from the heart
7294,1PE,1,NRSV,you have been born anew not of perishable but of imperishable seed through the living and enduring word of god
7295,1PE,1,NRSV,for all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass
7296,1PE,1,NRSV,the grass withers and the flower falls but the word of the lord endures forever
7297,1PE,1,NRSV,that word is the good news that was announced to you
7298,1PE,2,NRSV,rid yourselves therefore of all malice and all guile insincerity envy and all slander
7299,1PE,2,NRSV,like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow into salvation if indeed you have tasted that the lord is good
7300,1PE,2,NRSV,come to him a living stone though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in gods sight and like living stones let yourselves be built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ
7301,1PE,2,NRSV,for it stands in scripture see i am laying in zion a stone a cornerstone chosen and precious and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame
7302,1PE,2,NRSV,to you then who believe he is precious but for those who do not believe the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner and a stone that makes them stumble and a rock that makes them fall
7303,1PE,2,NRSV,they stumble because they disobey the word as they were destined to do
7304,1PE,2,NRSV,but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation gods own people in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
7305,1PE,2,NRSV,once you were not a people but now you are gods people once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy
7306,1PE,2,NRSV,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul
7307,1PE,2,NRSV,conduct yourselves honorably among the gentiles so that though they malign you as evildoers they may see your honorable deeds and glorify god when he comes to judge
7308,1PE,2,NRSV,for the lords sake accept the authority of every human institution whether of the emperor as supreme or of governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right
7309,1PE,2,NRSV,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish
7310,1PE,2,NRSV,as servants of god live as free people yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil
7311,1PE,2,NRSV,honor everyone
7312,1PE,2,NRSV,love the family of believers
7313,1PE,2,NRSV,fear god
7314,1PE,2,NRSV,honor the emperor
7315,1PE,2,NRSV,slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh
7316,1PE,2,NRSV,for it is a credit to you if being aware of god you endure pain while suffering unjustly
7317,1PE,2,NRSV,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that
7318,1PE,2,NRSV,but if you endure when you do right and suffer for it you have gods approval
7319,1PE,2,NRSV,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps
7320,1PE,2,NRSV,he committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth
7321,1PE,2,NRSV,when he was abused he did not return abuse when he suffered he did not threaten but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly
7322,1PE,2,NRSV,he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that free from sins we might live for righteousness by his wounds you have been healed
7323,1PE,2,NRSV,for you were going astray like sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls
7324,1PE,3,NRSV,wives in the same way accept the authority of your husbands so that even if some of them do not obey the word they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct when they see the purity and reverence of your lives
7325,1PE,3,NRSV,do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing rather let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is very precious in gods sight
7326,1PE,3,NRSV,it was in this way long ago that the holy women who hoped in god used to adorn themselves by accepting the authority of their husbands
7327,1PE,3,NRSV,thus sarah obeyed abraham and called him lord
7328,1PE,3,NRSV,you have become her daughters as long as you do what is good and never let fears alarm you
7329,1PE,3,NRSV,husbands in the same way show consideration for your wives in your life together paying honor to the woman as the weaker sex since they too are also heirs of the gracious gift of lifeso that nothing may hinder your prayers
7330,1PE,3,NRSV,finally all of you have unity of spirit sympathy love for one another a tender heart and a humble mind
7331,1PE,3,NRSV,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing
7332,1PE,3,NRSV,it is for this that you were calledthat you might inherit a blessing
7333,1PE,3,NRSV,for those who desire life and desire to see good days let them keep their tongues from evil and their lips from speaking deceit let them turn away from evil and do good let them seek peace and pursue it
7334,1PE,3,NRSV,for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer
7335,1PE,3,NRSV,but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
7336,1PE,3,NRSV,now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good
7337,1PE,3,NRSV,but even if you do suffer for doing what is right you are blessed
7338,1PE,3,NRSV,do not fear what they fear and do not be intimidated but in your hearts sanctify christ as lord
7339,1PE,3,NRSV,always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and reverence
7340,1PE,3,NRSV,keep your conscience clear so that when you are maligned those who abuse you for your good conduct in christ may be put to shame
7341,1PE,3,NRSV,for it is better to suffer for doing good if suffering should be gods will than to suffer for doing evil
7342,1PE,3,NRSV,for christ also suffered for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous in order to bring you to god
7343,1PE,3,NRSV,he was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison who in former times did not obey when god waited patiently in the days of noah during the building of the ark in which a few that is eight persons were saved through water
7344,1PE,3,NRSV,and baptism which this prefigured now saves younot as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to god for a good conscience through the resurrection of jesus christ who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god with angels authorities and powers made subject to him
7345,1PE,4,NRSV,since therefore christ suffered in the flesh arm yourselves also with the same intention for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of god
7346,1PE,4,NRSV,you have already spent enough time in doing what the gentiles like to do living in licentiousness passions drunkenness revels carousing and lawless idolatry
7347,1PE,4,NRSV,they are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation and so they blaspheme
7348,1PE,4,NRSV,but they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead
7349,1PE,4,NRSV,for this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead so that though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged they might live in the spirit as god does
7350,1PE,4,NRSV,the end of all things is near therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers
7351,1PE,4,NRSV,above all maintain constant love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins
7352,1PE,4,NRSV,be hospitable to one another without complaining
7353,1PE,4,NRSV,like good stewards of the manifold grace of god serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received
7354,1PE,4,NRSV,whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of god whoever serves must do so with the strength that god supplies so that god may be glorified in all things through jesus christ
7355,1PE,4,NRSV,to him belong the glory and the power forever and ever
7356,1PE,4,NRSV,amen
7357,1PE,4,NRSV,beloved do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you as though something strange were happening to you
7358,1PE,4,NRSV,but rejoice insofar as you are sharing christs sufferings so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed
7359,1PE,4,NRSV,if you are reviled for the name of christ you are blessed because the spirit of glory which is the spirit of god is resting on you
7360,1PE,4,NRSV,but let none of you suffer as a murderer a thief a criminal or even as a mischief maker
7361,1PE,4,NRSV,yet if any of you suffers as a christian do not consider it a disgrace but glorify god because you bear this name
7362,1PE,4,NRSV,for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of god if it begins with us what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of god
7363,1PE,4,NRSV,and if it is hard for the righteous to be saved what will become of the ungodly and the sinners
7364,1PE,4,NRSV,therefore let those suffering in accordance with gods will entrust themselves to a faithful creator while continuing to do good
7365,1PE,5,NRSV,now as an elder myself and a witness of the sufferings of christ as well as one who shares in the glory to be revealed i exhort the elders among you to tend the flock of god that is in your charge exercising the oversight not under compulsion but willingly as god would have you do it not for sordid gain but eagerly
7366,1PE,5,NRSV,do not lord it over those in your charge but be examples to the flock
7367,1PE,5,NRSV,and when the chief shepherd appears you will win the crown of glory that never fades away
7368,1PE,5,NRSV,in the same way you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders
7369,1PE,5,NRSV,and all of you must clothe yourselves with humility in your dealings with one another for god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
7370,1PE,5,NRSV,humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god so that he may exalt you in due time
7371,1PE,5,NRSV,cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you
7372,1PE,5,NRSV,discipline yourselves keep alert
7373,1PE,5,NRSV,like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around looking for someone to devour
7374,1PE,5,NRSV,resist him steadfast in your faith for you know that your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering
7375,1PE,5,NRSV,and after you have suffered for a little while the god of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself restore support strengthen and establish you
7376,1PE,5,NRSV,to him be the power forever and ever
7377,1PE,5,NRSV,amen
7378,1PE,5,NRSV,through silvanus whom i consider a faithful brother i have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of god
7379,1PE,5,NRSV,stand fast in it
7380,1PE,5,NRSV,your sister church in babylon chosen together with you sends you greetings and so does my son mark
7381,1PE,5,NRSV,greet one another with a kiss of love
7382,1PE,5,NRSV,peace to all of you who are in christ
7383,2PE,1,NRSV,simeon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ may grace and peace be yours in abundance in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
7384,2PE,1,NRSV,his divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness
7385,2PE,1,NRSV,thus he has given us through these things his precious and very great promises so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become participants of the divine nature
7386,2PE,1,NRSV,for this very reason you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness and goodness with knowledge and knowledge with selfcontrol and selfcontrol with endurance and endurance with godliness and godliness with mutual affection and mutual affection with love
7387,2PE,1,NRSV,for if these things are yours and are increasing among you they keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
7388,2PE,1,NRSV,for anyone who lacks these things is nearsighted and blind and is forgetful of the cleansing of past sins
7389,2PE,1,NRSV,therefore brothers and sisters be all the more eager to confirm your call and election for if you do this you will never stumble
7390,2PE,1,NRSV,for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly provided for you
7391,2PE,1,NRSV,therefore i intend to keep on reminding you of these things though you know them already and are established in the truth that has come to you
7392,2PE,1,NRSV,i think it right as long as i am in this body to refresh your memory since i know that my death will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me
7393,2PE,1,NRSV,and i will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things
7394,2PE,1,NRSV,for we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty
7395,2PE,1,NRSV,for he received honor and glory from god the father when that voice was conveyed to him by the majestic glory saying this is my son my beloved with whom i am well pleased
7396,2PE,1,NRSV,we ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain
7397,2PE,1,NRSV,so we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed
7398,2PE,1,NRSV,you will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts
7399,2PE,1,NRSV,first of all you must understand this that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation because no prophecy ever came by human will but men and women moved by the holy spirit spoke from god
7400,2PE,2,NRSV,but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive opinions
7401,2PE,2,NRSV,they will even deny the master who bought thembringing swift destruction on themselves
7402,2PE,2,NRSV,even so many will follow their licentious ways and because of these teachers the way of truth will be maligned
7403,2PE,2,NRSV,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words
7404,2PE,2,NRSV,their condemnation pronounced against them long ago has not been idle and their destruction is not asleep
7405,2PE,2,NRSV,for if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment and if he did not spare the ancient world even though he saved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly and if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly and if he rescued lot a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust and who despise authority
7406,2PE,2,NRSV,bold and willful they are not afraid to slander the glorious ones whereas angels though greater in might and power do not bring against them a slanderous judgment from the lord
7407,2PE,2,NRSV,these people however are like irrational animals mere creatures of instinct born to be caught and killed
7408,2PE,2,NRSV,they slander what they do not understand and when those creatures are destroyed they also will be destroyed suffering the penalty for doing wrong
7409,2PE,2,NRSV,they count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime
7410,2PE,2,NRSV,they are blots and blemishes reveling in their dissipation while they feast with you
7411,2PE,2,NRSV,they have eyes full of adultery insatiable for sin
7412,2PE,2,NRSV,they entice unsteady souls
7413,2PE,2,NRSV,they have hearts trained in greed
7414,2PE,2,NRSV,accursed children they have left the straight road and have gone astray following the road of balaam son of bosor who loved the wages of doing wrong but was rebuked for his own transgression a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophets madness
7415,2PE,2,NRSV,these are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm for them the deepest darkness has been reserved
7416,2PE,2,NRSV,for they speak bombastic nonsense and with licentious desires of the flesh they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error
7417,2PE,2,NRSV,they promise them freedom but they themselves are slaves of corruption for people are slaves to whatever masters them
7418,2PE,2,NRSV,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first
7419,2PE,2,NRSV,for it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that was passed on to them
7420,2PE,2,NRSV,it has happened to them according to the true proverb the dog turns back to its own vomit and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mud
7421,2PE,3,NRSV,this is now beloved the second letter i am writing to you in them i am trying to arouse your sincere intention by reminding you that you should remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of the lord and savior spoken through your apostles
7422,2PE,3,NRSV,first of all you must understand this that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and indulging their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming
7423,2PE,3,NRSV,for ever since our ancestors died all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation they deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of god heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished
7424,2PE,3,NRSV,but by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the godless
7425,2PE,3,NRSV,but do not ignore this one fact beloved that with the lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day
7426,2PE,3,NRSV,the lord is not slow about his promise as some think of slowness but is patient with you not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance
7427,2PE,3,NRSV,but the day of the lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the elements will be dissolved with fire and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed
7428,2PE,3,NRSV,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire
7429,2PE,3,NRSV,but in accordance with his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth where righteousness is at home
7430,2PE,3,NRSV,therefore beloved while you are waiting for these things strive to be found by him at peace without spot or blemish and regard the patience of our lord as salvation
7431,2PE,3,NRSV,so also our beloved brother paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him speaking of this as he does in all his letters
7432,2PE,3,NRSV,there are some things in them hard to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures
7433,2PE,3,NRSV,you therefore beloved since you are forewarned beware that you are not carried away with the error of the lawless and lose your own stability
7434,2PE,3,NRSV,but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ
7435,2PE,3,NRSV,to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity
7436,2PE,3,NRSV,amen
7437,1JN,1,NRSV,we declare to you what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life this life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it and declare to you the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
7438,1JN,1,NRSV,we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete
7439,1JN,1,NRSV,this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all
7440,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin
7441,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
7442,1JN,1,NRSV,if we confess our sins he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
7443,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
7444,1JN,2,NRSV,my little children i am writing these things to you so that you may not sin
7445,1JN,2,NRSV,but if anyone does sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
7446,1JN,2,NRSV,now by this we may be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments
7447,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i have come to know him but does not obey his commandments is a liar and in such a person the truth does not exist but whoever obeys his word truly in this person the love of god has reached perfection
7448,1JN,2,NRSV,by this we may be sure that we are in him whoever says i abide in him ought to walk just as he walked
7449,1JN,2,NRSV,beloved i am writing you no new commandment but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word that you have heard
7450,1JN,2,NRSV,yet i am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining
7451,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i am in the light while hating a brother or sister is still in the darkness
7452,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling
7453,1JN,2,NRSV,but whoever hates another believer is in the darkness walks in the darkness and does not know the way to go because the darkness has brought on blindness
7454,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you little children because your sins are forgiven on account of his name
7455,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you fathers because you know him who is from the beginning
7456,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you young people because you have conquered the evil one
7457,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you children because you know the father
7458,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you fathers because you know him who is from the beginning
7459,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you young people because you are strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the evil one
7460,1JN,2,NRSV,do not love the world or the things in the world
7461,1JN,2,NRSV,the love of the father is not in those who love the world for all that is in the worldthe desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes the pride in richescomes not from the father but from the world
7462,1JN,2,NRSV,and the world and its desire are passing away but those who do the will of god live forever
7463,1JN,2,NRSV,children it is the last hour as you have heard that antichrist is coming so now many antichrists have come
7464,1JN,2,NRSV,from this we know that it is the last hour
7465,1JN,2,NRSV,they went out from us but they did not belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us
7466,1JN,2,NRSV,but by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us
7467,1JN,2,NRSV,but you have been anointed by the holy one and all of you have knowledge
7468,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you know it and you know that no lie comes from the truth
7469,1JN,2,NRSV,who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ
7470,1JN,2,NRSV,this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son
7471,1JN,2,NRSV,no one who denies the son has the father everyone who confesses the son has the father also
7472,1JN,2,NRSV,let what you heard from the beginning abide in you
7473,1JN,2,NRSV,if what you heard from the beginning abides in you then you will abide in the son and in the father
7474,1JN,2,NRSV,and this is what he has promised us eternal life
7475,1JN,2,NRSV,i write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you
7476,1JN,2,NRSV,as for you the anointing that you received from him abides in you and so you do not need anyone to teach you
7477,1JN,2,NRSV,but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie and just as it has taught you abide in him
7478,1JN,2,NRSV,and now little children abide in him so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming
7479,1JN,2,NRSV,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him
7480,1JN,3,NRSV,see what love the father has given us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are
7481,1JN,3,NRSV,the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him
7482,1JN,3,NRSV,beloved we are gods children now what we will be has not yet been revealed
7483,1JN,3,NRSV,what we do know is this when he is revealed we will be like him for we will see him as he is
7484,1JN,3,NRSV,and all who have this hope in him purify themselves just as he is pure
7485,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness sin is lawlessness
7486,1JN,3,NRSV,you know that he was revealed to take away sins and in him there is no sin
7487,1JN,3,NRSV,no one who abides in him sins no one who sins has either seen him or known him
7488,1JN,3,NRSV,little children let no one deceive you
7489,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous
7490,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning
7491,1JN,3,NRSV,the son of god was revealed for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil
7492,1JN,3,NRSV,those who have been born of god do not sin because gods seed abides in them they cannot sin because they have been born of god
7493,1JN,3,NRSV,the children of god and the children of the devil are revealed in this way all who do not do what is right are not from god nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters
7494,1JN,3,NRSV,for this is the message you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another
7495,1JN,3,NRSV,we must not be like cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother
7496,1JN,3,NRSV,and why did he murder him
7497,1JN,3,NRSV,because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous
7498,1JN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished brothers and sisters that the world hates you
7499,1JN,3,NRSV,we know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another
7500,1JN,3,NRSV,whoever does not love abides in death
7501,1JN,3,NRSV,all who hate a brother or sister are murderers and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them
7502,1JN,3,NRSV,we know love by this that he laid down his life for usand we ought to lay down our lives for one another
7503,1JN,3,NRSV,how does gods love abide in anyone who has the worlds goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help
7504,1JN,3,NRSV,little children let us love not in word or speech but in truth and action
7505,1JN,3,NRSV,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything
7506,1JN,3,NRSV,beloved if our hearts do not condemn us we have boldness before god and we receive from him whatever we ask because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him
7507,1JN,3,NRSV,and this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he has commanded us
7508,1JN,3,NRSV,all who obey his commandments abide in him and he abides in them
7509,1JN,3,NRSV,and by this we know that he abides in us by the spirit that he has given us
7510,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god for many false prophets have gone out into the world
7511,1JN,4,NRSV,by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god
7512,1JN,4,NRSV,and this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world
7513,1JN,4,NRSV,little children you are from god and have conquered them for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world
7514,1JN,4,NRSV,they are from the world therefore what they say is from the world and the world listens to them
7515,1JN,4,NRSV,we are from god
7516,1JN,4,NRSV,whoever knows god listens to us and whoever is not from god does not listen to us
7517,1JN,4,NRSV,from this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
7518,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved let us love one another because love is from god everyone who loves is born of god and knows god
7519,1JN,4,NRSV,whoever does not love does not know god for god is love
7520,1JN,4,NRSV,gods love was revealed among us in this way god sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him
7521,1JN,4,NRSV,in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins
7522,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another
7523,1JN,4,NRSV,no one has ever seen god if we love one another god lives in us and his love is perfected in us
7524,1JN,4,NRSV,by this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit
7525,1JN,4,NRSV,and we have seen and do testify that the father has sent his son as the savior of the world
7526,1JN,4,NRSV,god abides in those who confess that jesus is the son of god and they abide in god
7527,1JN,4,NRSV,so we have known and believe the love that god has for us
7528,1JN,4,NRSV,god is love and those who abide in love abide in god and god abides in them
7529,1JN,4,NRSV,love has been perfected among us in this that we may have boldness on the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
7530,1JN,4,NRSV,there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love
7531,1JN,4,NRSV,we love because he first loved us
7532,1JN,4,NRSV,those who say i love god and hate their brothers or sisters are liars for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen cannot love god whom they have not seen
7533,1JN,4,NRSV,the commandment we have from him is this those who love god must love their brothers and sisters also
7534,1JN,5,NRSV,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child
7535,1JN,5,NRSV,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments
7536,1JN,5,NRSV,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments
7537,1JN,5,NRSV,and his commandments are not burdensome for whatever is born of god conquers the world
7538,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith
7539,1JN,5,NRSV,who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that jesus is the son of god
7540,1JN,5,NRSV,this is the one who came by water and blood jesus christ not with the water only but with the water and the blood
7541,1JN,5,NRSV,and the spirit is the one that testifies for the spirit is the truth
7542,1JN,5,NRSV,there are three that testify the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree
7543,1JN,5,NRSV,if we receive human testimony the testimony of god is greater for this is the testimony of god that he has testified to his son
7544,1JN,5,NRSV,those who believe in the son of god have the testimony in their hearts
7545,1JN,5,NRSV,those who do not believe in god have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that god has given concerning his son
7546,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son
7547,1JN,5,NRSV,whoever has the son has life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life
7548,1JN,5,NRSV,i write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life
7549,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the boldness we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us
7550,1JN,5,NRSV,and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have obtained the requests made of him
7551,1JN,5,NRSV,if you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin you will ask and god will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal
7552,1JN,5,NRSV,there is sin that is mortal i do not say that you should pray about that
7553,1JN,5,NRSV,all wrongdoing is sin but there is sin that is not mortal
7554,1JN,5,NRSV,we know that those who are born of god do not sin but the one who was born of god protects them and the evil one does not touch them
7555,1JN,5,NRSV,we know that we are gods children and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one
7556,1JN,5,NRSV,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ
7557,1JN,5,NRSV,he is the true god and eternal life
7558,1JN,5,NRSV,little children keep yourselves from idols
7559,2JN,1,NRSV,the elder to the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not only i but also all who know the truth because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the fathers son in truth and love
7560,2JN,1,NRSV,i was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth just as we have been commanded by the father
7561,2JN,1,NRSV,but now dear lady i ask you not as though i were writing you a new commandment but one we have had from the beginning let us love one another
7562,2JN,1,NRSV,and this is love that we walk according to his commandments this is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginningyou must walk in it
7563,2JN,1,NRSV,many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist be on your guard so that you do not lose what we have worked for but may receive a full reward
7564,2JN,1,NRSV,everyone who does not abide in the teaching of christ but goes beyond it does not have god whoever abides in the teaching has both the father and the son
7565,2JN,1,NRSV,do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person
7566,2JN,1,NRSV,although i have much to write to you i would rather not use paper and ink instead i hope to come to you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete
7567,2JN,1,NRSV,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings
7568,3JN,1,NRSV,the elder to the beloved gaius whom i love in truth
7569,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved i pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health just as it is well with your soul
7570,3JN,1,NRSV,i was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth namely how you walk in the truth
7571,3JN,1,NRSV,i have no greater joy than this to hear that my children are walking in the truth
7572,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends even though they are strangers to you they have testified to your love before the church
7573,3JN,1,NRSV,you will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of god for they began their journey for the sake of christ accepting no support from nonbelievers
7574,3JN,1,NRSV,therefore we ought to support such people so that we may become coworkers with the truth
7575,3JN,1,NRSV,i have written something to the church but diotrephes who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority
7576,3JN,1,NRSV,so if i come i will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us
7577,3JN,1,NRSV,and not content with those charges he refuses to welcome the friends and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from the church
7578,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good
7579,3JN,1,NRSV,whoever does good is from god whoever does evil has not seen god
7580,3JN,1,NRSV,everyone has testified favorably about demetrius and so has the truth itself
7581,3JN,1,NRSV,we also testify for him and you know that our testimony is true
7582,3JN,1,NRSV,i have much to write to you but i would rather not write with pen and ink instead i hope to see you soon and we will talk together face to face
7583,3JN,1,NRSV,peace to you
7584,3JN,1,NRSV,the friends send you their greetings
7585,3JN,1,NRSV,greet the friends there each by name
7586,JUD,1,NRSV,jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to those who are called who are beloved in god the father and kept safe for jesus christ may mercy peace and love be yours in abundance
7587,JUD,1,NRSV,beloved while eagerly preparing to write to you about the salvation we share i find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints
7588,JUD,1,NRSV,for certain intruders have stolen in among you people who long ago were designated for this condemnation as ungodly who pervert the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ
7589,JUD,1,NRSV,now i desire to remind you though you are fully informed that the lord who once for all saved a people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe
7590,JUD,1,NRSV,and the angels who did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day
7591,JUD,1,NRSV,likewise sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding cities which in the same manner as they indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire
7592,JUD,1,NRSV,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones
7593,JUD,1,NRSV,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him but said the lord rebuke you but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct
7594,JUD,1,NRSV,woe to them for they go the way of cain and abandon themselves to balaams error for the sake of gain and perish in korahs rebellion
7595,JUD,1,NRSV,these are blemishes on your lovefeasts while they feast with you without fear feeding themselves
7596,JUD,1,NRSV,they are waterless clouds carried along by the winds autumn trees without fruit twice dead uprooted wild waves of the sea casting up the foam of their own shame wandering stars for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever
7597,JUD,1,NRSV,it was also about these that enoch in the seventh generation from adam prophesied saying see the lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him
7598,JUD,1,NRSV,these are grumblers and malcontents they indulge their own lusts they are bombastic in speech flattering people to their own advantage

7682,REV,3,NRSV,listen i am standing at the door knocking if you hear my voice and open the door i will come in to you and eat with you and you with me
7683,REV,3,NRSV,to the one who conquers i will give a place with me on my throne just as i myself conquered and sat down with my father on his throne
7684,REV,3,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches
7685,REV,4,NRSV,after this i looked and there in heaven a door stood open and the first voice which i had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said come up here and i will show you what must take place after this
7686,REV,4,NRSV,at once i was in the spirit and there in heaven stood a throne with one seated on the throne and the one seated there looks like jasper and carnelian and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald
7687,REV,4,NRSV,around the throne are twentyfour thrones and seated on the thrones are twentyfour elders dressed in white robes with golden crowns on their heads
7688,REV,4,NRSV,coming from the throne are flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches which are the seven spirits of god and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass like crystal
7689,REV,4,NRSV,around the throne and on each side of the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind the first living creature like a lion the second living creature like an ox the third living creature with a face like a human face and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle
7690,REV,4,NRSV,and the four living creatures each of them with six wings are full of eyes all around and inside
7691,REV,4,NRSV,day and night without ceasing they sing holy holy holy the lord god the almighty who was and is and is to come
7692,REV,4,NRSV,and whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne who lives forever and ever the twentyfour elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever they cast their crowns before the throne singing you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they existed and were created
7693,REV,5,NRSV,then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back sealed with seven seals and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals
7694,REV,5,NRSV,and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it
7695,REV,5,NRSV,and i began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it
7696,REV,5,NRSV,then one of the elders said to me do not weep
7697,REV,5,NRSV,see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals
7698,REV,5,NRSV,then i saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth
7699,REV,5,NRSV,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne
7700,REV,5,NRSV,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints
7701,REV,5,NRSV,they sing a new song you are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for god saints from every tribe and language and people and nation you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our god and they will reign on earth
7702,REV,5,NRSV,then i looked and i heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands singing with full voice worthy is the lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them singing to the one seated on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped
7703,REV,6,NRSV,then i saw the lamb open one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures call out as with a voice of thunder come i looked and there was a white horse its rider had a bow a crown was given to him and he came out conquering and to conquer
7704,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature call out come and out came another horse bright red its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth so that people would slaughter one another and he was given a great sword
7705,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the third seal i heard the third living creature call out come i looked and there was a black horse its rider held a pair of scales in his hand and i heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for a days pay and three quarts of barley for a days pay but do not damage the olive oil and the wine when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature call out come i looked and there was a pale green horse its riders name was death and hades followed with him they were given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword famine and pestilence and by the wild animals of the earth
7706,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the word of god and for the testimony they had given they cried out with a loud voice sovereign lord holy and true how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth
7707,REV,6,NRSV,they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer until the number would be complete both of their fellow servants and of their brothers and sisters who were soon to be killed as they themselves had been killed
7708,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the sixth seal i looked and there came a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale
7709,REV,6,NRSV,the sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up and every mountain and island was removed from its place
7710,REV,6,NRSV,then the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the rich and the powerful and everyone slave and free hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains calling to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of their wrath has come and who is able to stand
7711,REV,7,NRSV,after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree
7712,REV,7,NRSV,i saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun having the seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea saying do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have marked the servants of our god with a seal on their foreheads
7713,REV,7,NRSV,and i heard the number of those who were sealed one hundred fortyfour thousand sealed out of every tribe of the people of israel from the tribe of judah twelve thousand sealed from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand from the tribe of gad twelve thousand from the tribe of asher twelve thousand from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand from the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand from the tribe of levi twelve thousand from the tribe of issachar twelve thousand from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand from the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand sealed
7714,REV,7,NRSV,after this i looked and there was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation from all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and before the lamb robed in white with palm branches in their hands
7715,REV,7,NRSV,they cried out in a loud voice saying salvation belongs to our god who is seated on the throne and to the lamb and all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped god singing amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our god forever and ever amen
7716,REV,7,NRSV,then one of the elders addressed me saying who are these robed in white and where have they come from
7717,REV,7,NRSV,i said to him sir you are the one that knows
7718,REV,7,NRSV,then he said to me these are they who have come out of the great ordeal they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
7719,REV,7,NRSV,for this reason they are before the throne of god and worship him day and night within his temple and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them
7720,REV,7,NRSV,they will hunger no more and thirst no more the sun will not strike them nor any scorching heat for the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd and he will guide them to springs of the water of life and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes
7721,REV,8,NRSV,when the lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour
7722,REV,8,NRSV,and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and seven trumpets were given to them
7723,REV,8,NRSV,another angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar he was given a great quantity of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that is before the throne
7724,REV,8,NRSV,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel
7725,REV,8,NRSV,then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth and there were peals of thunder rumblings flashes of lightning and an earthquake
7726,REV,8,NRSV,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them
7727,REV,8,NRSV,the first angel blew his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and they were hurled to the earth and a third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up
7728,REV,8,NRSV,the second angel blew his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea
7729,REV,8,NRSV,a third of the sea became blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed
7730,REV,8,NRSV,the third angel blew his trumpet and a great star fell from heaven blazing like a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water
7731,REV,8,NRSV,the name of the star is wormwood
7732,REV,8,NRSV,a third of the waters became wormwood and many died from the water because it was made bitter
7733,REV,8,NRSV,the fourth angel blew his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of their light was darkened a third of the day was kept from shining and likewise the night
7734,REV,8,NRSV,then i looked and i heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew in midheaven woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow
7735,REV,9,NRSV,and the fifth angel blew his trumpet and i saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft
7736,REV,9,NRSV,then from the smoke came locusts on the earth and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth
7737,REV,9,NRSV,they were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree but only those people who do not have the seal of god on their foreheads
7738,REV,9,NRSV,they were allowed to torture them for five months but not to kill them and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone
7739,REV,9,NRSV,and in those days people will seek death but will not find it they will long to die but death will flee from them
7740,REV,9,NRSV,in appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle
7741,REV,9,NRSV,on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold their faces were like human faces their hair like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth they had scales like iron breastplates and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle
7742,REV,9,NRSV,they have tails like scorpions with stingers and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months
7743,REV,9,NRSV,they have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit his name in hebrew is abaddon and in greek he is called apollyon
7744,REV,9,NRSV,the first woe has passed
7745,REV,9,NRSV,there are still two woes to come
7746,REV,9,NRSV,then the sixth angel blew his trumpet and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before god saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates
7747,REV,9,NRSV,so the four angels were released who had been held ready for the hour the day the month and the year to kill a third of humankind
7748,REV,9,NRSV,the number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million i heard their number
7749,REV,9,NRSV,and this was how i saw the horses in my vision the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur the heads of the horses were like lions heads and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths
7750,REV,9,NRSV,by these three plagues a third of humankind was killed by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths
7751,REV,9,NRSV,for the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails their tails are like serpents having heads and with them they inflict harm
7752,REV,9,NRSV,the rest of humankind who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood which cannot see or hear or walk
7753,REV,9,NRSV,and they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts
7754,REV,10,NRSV,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire
7755,REV,10,NRSV,he held a little scroll open in his hand
7756,REV,10,NRSV,setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land he gave a great shout like a lion roaring
7757,REV,10,NRSV,and when he shouted the seven thunders sounded
7758,REV,10,NRSV,and when the seven thunders had sounded i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down
7759,REV,10,NRSV,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants the prophets
7760,REV,10,NRSV,then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land
7761,REV,10,NRSV,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth
7762,REV,10,NRSV,so i took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it it was sweet as honey in my mouth but when i had eaten it my stomach was made bitter
7763,REV,10,NRSV,then they said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings
7764,REV,11,NRSV,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months
7765,REV,11,NRSV,and i will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days wearing sackcloth
7766,REV,11,NRSV,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth
7767,REV,11,NRSV,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner
7768,REV,11,NRSV,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire
7769,REV,11,NRSV,when they have finished their testimony the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically called sodom and egypt where also their lord was crucified
7770,REV,11,NRSV,for three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth
7771,REV,11,NRSV,but after the three and a half days the breath of life from god entered them and they stood on their feet and those who saw them were terrified
7772,REV,11,NRSV,then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them come up here and they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them
7773,REV,11,NRSV,at that moment there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the god of heaven
7774,REV,11,NRSV,the second woe has passed
7775,REV,11,NRSV,the third woe is coming very soon
7776,REV,11,NRSV,then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his messiah and he will reign forever and ever
7777,REV,11,NRSV,then the twentyfour elders who sit on their thrones before god fell on their faces and worshiped god singing we give you thanks lord god almighty who are and who were for you have taken your great power and begun to reign
7778,REV,11,NRSV,the nations raged but your wrath has come and the time for judging the dead for rewarding your servants the prophets and saints and all who fear your name both small and great and for destroying those who destroy the earth
7779,REV,11,NRSV,then gods temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple and there were flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder an earthquake and heavy hail
7780,REV,12,NRSV,a great portent appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
7781,REV,12,NRSV,she was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs in the agony of giving birth
7782,REV,12,NRSV,then another portent appeared in heaven a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems on his heads
7783,REV,12,NRSV,his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth
7784,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born
7785,REV,12,NRSV,and she gave birth to a son a male child who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron
7786,REV,12,NRSV,but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days
7787,REV,12,NRSV,and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon
7788,REV,12,NRSV,the dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven
7789,REV,12,NRSV,the great dragon was thrown down that ancient serpent who is called the devil and satan the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him
7790,REV,12,NRSV,then i heard a loud voice in heaven proclaiming now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his messiah for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down who accuses them day and night before our god
7791,REV,12,NRSV,but they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony for they did not cling to life even in the face of death
7792,REV,12,NRSV,rejoice then you heavens and those who dwell in them but woe to the earth and the sea for the devil has come down to you with great wrath because he knows that his time is short so when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child
7793,REV,12,NRSV,but the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness to her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time
7794,REV,12,NRSV,then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a river after the woman to sweep her away with the flood
7795,REV,12,NRSV,but the earth came to the help of the woman it opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth
7796,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her children those who keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus
7797,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore
7798,REV,13,NRSV,and i saw a beast rising out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on its horns were ten diadems and on its heads were blasphemous names
7799,REV,13,NRSV,and the beast that i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears and its mouth was like a lions mouth
7800,REV,13,NRSV,and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority
7801,REV,13,NRSV,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound had been healed
7802,REV,13,NRSV,in amazement the whole earth followed the beast
7803,REV,13,NRSV,they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it
7804,REV,13,NRSV,the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for fortytwo months
7805,REV,13,NRSV,it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his dwelling that is those who dwell in heaven
7806,REV,13,NRSV,also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them
7807,REV,13,NRSV,it was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that was slaughtered
7808,REV,13,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen if you are to be taken captive into captivity you go if you kill with the sword with the sword you must be killed
7809,REV,13,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints
7810,REV,13,NRSV,then i saw another beast that rose out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon
7811,REV,13,NRSV,it exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound had been healed
7812,REV,13,NRSV,it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast it deceives the inhabitants of earth telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed
7813,REV,13,NRSV,also it causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name
7814,REV,13,NRSV,this calls for wisdom let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a person
7815,REV,13,NRSV,its number is six hundred sixtysix
7816,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him were one hundred fortyfour thousand who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads
7817,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder the voice i heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders
7818,REV,14,NRSV,no one could learn that song except the one hundred fortyfour thousand who have been redeemed from the earth
7819,REV,14,NRSV,it is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are virgins these follow the lamb wherever he goes
7820,REV,14,NRSV,they have been redeemed from humankind as first fruits for god and the lamb and in their mouth no lie was found they are blameless
7821,REV,14,NRSV,then i saw another angel flying in midheaven with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earthto every nation and tribe and language and people
7822,REV,14,NRSV,he said in a loud voice fear god and give him glory for the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made heaven and earth the sea and the springs of water
7823,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a second followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication
7824,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
7825,REV,14,NRSV,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever
7826,REV,14,NRSV,there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name
7827,REV,14,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance of the saints those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of jesus
7828,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord
7829,REV,14,NRSV,yes says the spirit they will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them
7830,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was a white cloud and seated on the cloud was one like the son of man with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand another angel came out of the temple calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud use your sickle and reap for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe
7831,REV,14,NRSV,so the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped
7832,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel came out of the temple in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle
7833,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel came out from the altar the angel who has authority over fire and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for its grapes are ripe
7834,REV,14,NRSV,so the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of god
7835,REV,14,NRSV,and the wine press was trodden outside the city and blood flowed from the wine press as high as a horses bridle for a distance of about two hundred miles
7836,REV,15,NRSV,then i saw another portent in heaven great and amazing seven angels with seven plagues which are the last for with them the wrath of god is ended
7837,REV,15,NRSV,and i saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name standing beside the sea of glass with harps of god in their hands
7838,REV,15,NRSV,and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb great and amazing are your deeds lord god the almighty just and true are your ways king of the nations lord who will not fear and glorify your name
7839,REV,15,NRSV,for you alone are holy
7840,REV,15,NRSV,all nations will come and worship before you for your judgments have been revealed
7841,REV,15,NRSV,after this i looked and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues robed in pure bright linen with golden sashes across their chests
7842,REV,15,NRSV,then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who lives forever and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended
7843,REV,16,NRSV,then i heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of god
7844,REV,16,NRSV,so the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth and a foul and painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image
7845,REV,16,NRSV,the second angel poured his bowl into the sea and it became like the blood of a corpse and every living thing in the sea died
7846,REV,16,NRSV,the third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water and they became blood
7847,REV,16,NRSV,and i heard the angel of the waters say you are just o holy one who are and were for you have judged these things because they shed the blood of saints and prophets you have given them blood to drink
7848,REV,16,NRSV,it is what they deserve and i heard the altar respond yes o lord god the almighty your judgments are true and just the fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun and it was allowed to scorch them with fire they were scorched by the fierce heat but they cursed the name of god who had authority over these plagues and they did not repent and give him glory
7849,REV,16,NRSV,the fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast and its kingdom was plunged into darkness people gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and sores and they did not repent of their deeds
7850,REV,16,NRSV,the sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east
7851,REV,16,NRSV,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet
7852,REV,16,NRSV,these are demonic spirits performing signs who go abroad to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for battle on the great day of god the almighty
7853,REV,16,NRSV,see i am coming like a thief blessed is the one who stays awake and is clothed not going about naked and exposed to shame and they assembled them at the place that in hebrew is called harmagedon
7854,REV,16,NRSV,the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a violent earthquake such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth so violent was that earthquake
7855,REV,16,NRSV,the great city was split into three parts and the cities of the nations fell
7856,REV,16,NRSV,god remembered great babylon and gave her the winecup of the fury of his wrath
7857,REV,16,NRSV,and every island fled away and no mountains were to be found and huge hailstones each weighing about a hundred pounds dropped from heaven on people until they cursed god for the plague of the hail so fearful was that plague
7858,REV,17,NRSV,then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me come i will show you the judgment of the great whore who is seated on many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and with the wine of whose fornication the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk
7859,REV,17,NRSV,so he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness and i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and it had seven heads and ten horns
7860,REV,17,NRSV,the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication and on her forehead was written a name a mystery babylon the great mother of whores and of earths abominations
7861,REV,17,NRSV,and i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to jesus
7862,REV,17,NRSV,when i saw her i was greatly amazed
7863,REV,17,NRSV,but the angel said to me why are you so amazed
7864,REV,17,NRSV,i will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her
7865,REV,17,NRSV,the beast that you saw was and is not and is about to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to destruction
7866,REV,17,NRSV,and the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be amazed when they see the beast because it was and is not and is to come
7867,REV,17,NRSV,this calls for a mind that has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated also they are seven kings of whom five have fallen one is living and the other has not yet come and when he comes he must remain only a little while
7868,REV,17,NRSV,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction
7869,REV,17,NRSV,and the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour together with the beast
7870,REV,17,NRSV,these are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast they will make war on the lamb and the lamb will conquer them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those with him are called and chosen and faithful
7871,REV,17,NRSV,and he said to me the waters that you saw where the whore is seated are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages
7872,REV,17,NRSV,and the ten horns that you saw they and the beast will hate the whore they will make her desolate and naked they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire
7873,REV,17,NRSV,for god has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of god will be fulfilled
7874,REV,17,NRSV,the woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth
7875,REV,18,NRSV,after this i saw another angel coming down from heaven having great authority and the earth was made bright with his splendor
7876,REV,18,NRSV,he called out with a mighty voice fallen fallen is babylon the great it has become a dwelling place of demons a haunt of every foul spirit a haunt of every foul bird a haunt of every foul and hateful beast
7877,REV,18,NRSV,for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxury
7878,REV,18,NRSV,then i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people so that you do not take part in her sins and so that you do not share in her plagues for her sins are heaped high as heaven and god has remembered her iniquities
7879,REV,18,NRSV,render to her as she herself has rendered and repay her double for her deeds mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed
7880,REV,18,NRSV,as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously so give her a like measure of torment and grief
7881,REV,18,NRSV,since in her heart she says i rule as a queen i am no widow and i will never see grief therefore her plagues will come in a single day pestilence and mourning and famine and she will be burned with fire for mighty is the lord god who judges her
7882,REV,18,NRSV,and the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning they will stand far off in fear of her torment and say alas alas the great city babylon the mighty city for in one hour your judgment has come
7883,REV,18,NRSV,and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one buys their cargo anymore cargo of gold silver jewels and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet all kinds of scented wood all articles of ivory all articles of costly wood bronze iron and marble cinnamon spice incense myrrh frankincense wine olive oil choice flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and chariots slavesand human lives
7884,REV,18,NRSV,the fruit for which your soul longed has gone from you and all your dainties and your splendor are lost to you never to be found again the merchants of these wares who gained wealth from her will stand far off in fear of her torment weeping and mourning aloud alas alas the great city clothed in fine linen in purple and scarlet adorned with gold with jewels and with pearls for in one hour all this wealth has been laid waste and all shipmasters and seafarers sailors and all whose trade is on the sea stood far off and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning what city was like the great city
7885,REV,18,NRSV,and they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned crying out alas alas the great city where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth for in one hour she has been laid waste
7886,REV,18,NRSV,rejoice over her o heaven you saints and apostles and prophets for god has given judgment for you against her
7887,REV,18,NRSV,then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying with such violence babylon the great city will be thrown down and will be found no more and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters will be heard in you no more and an artisan of any trade will be found in you no more and the sound of the millstone will be heard in you no more and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more for your merchants were the magnates of the earth and all nations were deceived by your sorcery
7888,REV,18,NRSV,and in you was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slaughtered on earth
7889,REV,19,NRSV,after this i heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and power to our god for his judgments are true and just he has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her fornication and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants
7890,REV,19,NRSV,once more they said hallelujah the smoke goes up from her forever and ever
7891,REV,19,NRSV,and the twentyfour elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who is seated on the throne saying amen
7892,REV,19,NRSV,hallelujah and from the throne came a voice saying praise our god all you his servants and all who fear him small and great
7893,REV,19,NRSV,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out hallelujah for the lord our god the almighty reigns

7896,REV,19,NRSV,and he said to me these are true words of god
7897,REV,19,NRSV,then i fell down at his feet to worship him but he said to me you must not do that i am a fellow servant with you and your comrades who hold the testimony of jesus
7898,REV,19,NRSV,worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
