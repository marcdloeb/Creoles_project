23,MAT,1,NRSV,fourteen generations
24,MAT,1,NRSV,now the birth of jesus the messiah
25,MAT,1,NRSV,took place in this way when his mother mary had been engaged to joseph but before they lived together she was found to be with child from the holy spirit
26,MAT,1,NRSV,her husband joseph being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace planned to dismiss her quietly
27,MAT,1,NRSV,but just when he had resolved to do this an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream and said joseph son of david do not be afraid to take mary as your wife for the child conceived in her is from the holy spirit
28,MAT,1,NRSV,she will bear a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins
29,MAT,1,NRSV,all this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet
30,MAT,1,NRSV,look the virgin shall conceive and bear a son
31,MAT,1,NRSV,and they shall name him emmanuel
32,MAT,1,NRSV,which means god is with us
33,MAT,1,NRSV,when joseph awoke from sleep he did as the angel of the lord commanded him he took her as his wife
34,MAT,1,NRSV,but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son
35,MAT,1,NRSV,and he named him jesus
36,MAT,2,NRSV,in the time of king herod after jesus was born in bethlehem of judea wise men
37,MAT,2,NRSV,from the east came to jerusalem
38,MAT,2,NRSV,asking where is the child who has been born king of the jews for we observed his star at its rising
39,MAT,2,NRSV,and have come to pay him homage
40,MAT,2,NRSV,when king herod heard this he was frightened and all jerusalem with him
41,MAT,2,NRSV,and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the messiah
42,MAT,2,NRSV,was to be born
43,MAT,2,NRSV,they told him in bethlehem of judea for so it has been written by the prophet
44,MAT,2,NRSV,and you bethlehem in the land of judah
45,MAT,2,NRSV,are by no means least among the rulers of judah
46,MAT,2,NRSV,for from you shall come a ruler
47,MAT,2,NRSV,who is to shepherd
48,MAT,2,NRSV,my people israel
49,MAT,2,NRSV,then herod secretly called for the wise men
50,MAT,2,NRSV,and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared
51,MAT,2,NRSV,then he sent them to bethlehem saying go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word so that i may also go and pay him homage
52,MAT,2,NRSV,when they had heard the king they set out and there ahead of them went the star that they had seen at its rising
53,MAT,2,NRSV,until it stopped over the place where the child was
54,MAT,2,NRSV,when they saw that the star had stopped
55,MAT,2,NRSV,they were overwhelmed with joy
56,MAT,2,NRSV,on entering the house they saw the child with mary his mother and they knelt down and paid him homage then opening their treasure chests they offered him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
57,MAT,2,NRSV,and having been warned in a dream not to return to herod they left for their own country by another road
58,MAT,2,NRSV,now after they had left an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream and said get up take the child and his mother and flee to egypt and remain there until i tell you for herod is about to search for the child to destroy him
59,MAT,2,NRSV,then joseph
60,MAT,2,NRSV,got up took the child and his mother by night and went to egypt
61,MAT,2,NRSV,and remained there until the death of herod this was to fulfill what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet out of egypt i have called my son
62,MAT,2,NRSV,when herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men
63,MAT,2,NRSV,he was infuriated and he sent and killed all the children in and around bethlehem who were two years old or under according to the time that he had learned from the wise men
64,MAT,2,NRSV,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah
65,MAT,2,NRSV,a voice was heard in ramah
66,MAT,2,NRSV,wailing and loud lamentation
67,MAT,2,NRSV,rachel weeping for her children
68,MAT,2,NRSV,she refused to be consoled because they are no more
69,MAT,2,NRSV,when herod died an angel of the lord suddenly appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt and said
70,MAT,2,NRSV,get up take the child and his mother and go to the land of israel for those who were seeking the childs life are dead
71,MAT,2,NRSV,then joseph
72,MAT,2,NRSV,got up took the child and his mother and went to the land of israel
73,MAT,2,NRSV,but when he heard that archelaus was ruling over judea in place of his father herod he was afraid to go there and after being warned in a dream he went away to the district of galilee
74,MAT,2,NRSV,there he made his home in a town called nazareth so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled he will be called a nazorean
75,MAT,3,NRSV,in those days john the baptist appeared in the wilderness of judea proclaiming
76,MAT,3,NRSV,repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near
77,MAT,3,NRSV,this is the one of whom the prophet isaiah spoke when he said
78,MAT,3,NRSV,the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
79,MAT,3,NRSV,prepare the way of the lord
80,MAT,3,NRSV,make his paths straight
81,MAT,3,NRSV,now john wore clothing of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and his food was locusts and wild honey
82,MAT,3,NRSV,then the people of jerusalem and all judea were going out to him and all the region along the jordan
83,MAT,3,NRSV,and they were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins
84,MAT,3,NRSV,but when he saw many pharisees and sadducees coming for baptism he said to them you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come
85,MAT,3,NRSV,bear fruit worthy of repentance
86,MAT,3,NRSV,do not presume to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham
87,MAT,3,NRSV,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
88,MAT,3,NRSV,i baptize you with
89,MAT,3,NRSV,water for repentance but one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to carry his sandals he will baptize you with
90,MAT,3,NRSV,the holy spirit and fire
91,MAT,3,NRSV,his winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire
92,MAT,3,NRSV,then jesus came from galilee to john at the jordan to be baptized by him
93,MAT,3,NRSV,john would have prevented him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me
94,MAT,3,NRSV,but jesus answered him let it be so now for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness then he consented
95,MAT,3,NRSV,and when jesus had been baptized just as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him
96,MAT,3,NRSV,and a voice from heaven said this is my son the beloved
97,MAT,3,NRSV,with whom i am well pleased
98,MAT,4,NRSV,then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
99,MAT,4,NRSV,he fasted forty days and forty nights and afterwards he was famished
100,MAT,4,NRSV,the tempter came and said to him if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread
101,MAT,4,NRSV,but he answered it is written
102,MAT,4,NRSV,one does not live by bread alone
103,MAT,4,NRSV,but by every word that comes from the mouth of god
104,MAT,4,NRSV,then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple
105,MAT,4,NRSV,saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written
106,MAT,4,NRSV,he will command his angels concerning you
107,MAT,4,NRSV,and on their hands they will bear you up
108,MAT,4,NRSV,so that you will not dash your foot against a stone
109,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus said to him again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test
110,MAT,4,NRSV,again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor
111,MAT,4,NRSV,and he said to him all these i will give you if you will fall down and worship me
112,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus said to him away with you satan for it is written
113,MAT,4,NRSV,worship the lord your god
114,MAT,4,NRSV,and serve only him
115,MAT,4,NRSV,then the devil left him and suddenly angels came and waited on him
116,MAT,4,NRSV,now when jesus
117,MAT,4,NRSV,heard that john had been arrested he withdrew to galilee
118,MAT,4,NRSV,he left nazareth and made his home in capernaum by the sea in the territory of zebulun and naphtali
119,MAT,4,NRSV,so that what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah might be fulfilled
120,MAT,4,NRSV,land of zebulun land of naphtali
121,MAT,4,NRSV,on the road by the sea across the jordan galilee of the gentiles
122,MAT,4,NRSV,the people who sat in darkness
123,MAT,4,NRSV,have seen a great light
124,MAT,4,NRSV,and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death
125,MAT,4,NRSV,light has dawned
126,MAT,4,NRSV,from that time jesus began to proclaim repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near
127,MAT,4,NRSV,as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the seafor they were fishermen
128,MAT,4,NRSV,and he said to them follow me and i will make you fish for people
129,MAT,4,NRSV,immediately they left their nets and followed him
130,MAT,4,NRSV,as he went from there he saw two other brothers james son of zebedee and his brother john in the boat with their father zebedee mending their nets and he called them
131,MAT,4,NRSV,immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him
132,MAT,4,NRSV,jesus
133,MAT,4,NRSV,went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news
134,MAT,4,NRSV,of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people
135,MAT,4,NRSV,so his fame spread throughout all syria and they brought to him all the sick those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains demoniacs epileptics and paralytics and he cured them
136,MAT,4,NRSV,and great crowds followed him from galilee the decapolis jerusalem judea and from beyond the jordan
137,MAT,5,NRSV,when jesus
138,MAT,5,NRSV,saw the crowds he went up the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him
139,MAT,5,NRSV,then he began to speak and taught them saying
140,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
141,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted
142,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth
143,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
144,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the merciful for they will receive mercy
145,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the pure in heart for they will see god
146,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god
147,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
148,MAT,5,NRSV,blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely
149,MAT,5,NRSV,on my account
150,MAT,5,NRSV,rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you
151,MAT,5,NRSV,you are the salt of the earth but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored it is no longer good for anything but is thrown out and trampled under foot
152,MAT,5,NRSV,you are the light of the world a city built on a hill cannot be hid
153,MAT,5,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket but on the lampstand and it gives light to all in the house
154,MAT,5,NRSV,in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven
155,MAT,5,NRSV,do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have come not to abolish but to fulfill
156,MAT,5,NRSV,for truly i tell you until heaven and earth pass away not one letter
157,MAT,5,NRSV,not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished
158,MAT,5,NRSV,therefore whoever breaks
159,MAT,5,NRSV,one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven
160,MAT,5,NRSV,for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
161,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment
162,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister
163,MAT,5,NRSV,you will be liable to judgment and if you insult
164,MAT,5,NRSV,a brother or sister
165,MAT,5,NRSV,you will be liable to the council and if you say you fool you will be liable to the hell
166,MAT,5,NRSV,of fire
167,MAT,5,NRSV,so when you are offering your gift at the altar if you remember that your brother or sister
168,MAT,5,NRSV,has something against you
169,MAT,5,NRSV,leave your gift there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother or sister
170,MAT,5,NRSV,and then come and offer your gift
171,MAT,5,NRSV,come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court
172,MAT,5,NRSV,with him or your accuser may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you will be thrown into prison
173,MAT,5,NRSV,truly i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the last penny
174,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery
175,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart
176,MAT,5,NRSV,if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell
177,MAT,5,NRSV,and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell
178,MAT,5,NRSV,it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce
179,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
180,MAT,5,NRSV,again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord
181,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god
182,MAT,5,NRSV,or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
183,MAT,5,NRSV,and do not swear by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black
184,MAT,5,NRSV,let your word be yes yes or no no anything more than this comes from the evil one
185,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
186,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you do not resist an evildoer but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also
187,MAT,5,NRSV,and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat give your cloak as well
188,MAT,5,NRSV,and if anyone forces you to go one mile go also the second mile
189,MAT,5,NRSV,give to everyone who begs from you and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you
190,MAT,5,NRSV,you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy
191,MAT,5,NRSV,but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
192,MAT,5,NRSV,so that you may be children of your father in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous
193,MAT,5,NRSV,for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same
194,MAT,5,NRSV,and if you greet only your brothers and sisters
195,MAT,5,NRSV,what more are you doing than others do not even the gentiles do the same
196,MAT,5,NRSV,be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect
197,MAT,6,NRSV,beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them for then you have no reward from your father in heaven
198,MAT,6,NRSV,so whenever you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be praised by others truly i tell you they have received their reward
199,MAT,6,NRSV,but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
200,MAT,6,NRSV,so that your alms may be done in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
201,MAT,6,NRSV,and whenever you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners so that they may be seen by others truly i tell you they have received their reward
202,MAT,6,NRSV,but whenever you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
203,MAT,6,NRSV,when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words
204,MAT,6,NRSV,do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him
205,MAT,6,NRSV,pray then in this way
206,MAT,6,NRSV,our father in heaven
207,MAT,6,NRSV,hallowed be your name
208,MAT,6,NRSV,your kingdom come
209,MAT,6,NRSV,your will be done
210,MAT,6,NRSV,on earth as it is in heaven
211,MAT,6,NRSV,give us this day our daily bread
212,MAT,6,NRSV,and forgive us our debts
213,MAT,6,NRSV,as we also have forgiven our debtors
214,MAT,6,NRSV,and do not bring us to the time of trial
215,MAT,6,NRSV,but rescue us from the evil one
216,MAT,6,NRSV,for if you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
217,MAT,6,NRSV,but if you do not forgive others neither will your father forgive your trespasses
218,MAT,6,NRSV,and whenever you fast do not look dismal like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting truly i tell you they have received their reward
219,MAT,6,NRSV,but when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face
220,MAT,6,NRSV,so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
221,MAT,6,NRSV,do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust
222,MAT,6,NRSV,consume and where thieves break in and steal
223,MAT,6,NRSV,but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust
224,MAT,6,NRSV,consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal
225,MAT,6,NRSV,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
226,MAT,6,NRSV,the eye is the lamp of the body so if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light
227,MAT,6,NRSV,but if your eye is unhealthy your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness
228,MAT,6,NRSV,no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and wealth
229,MAT,6,NRSV,therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink
230,MAT,6,NRSV,or about your body what you will wear is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
231,MAT,6,NRSV,look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not of more value than they
232,MAT,6,NRSV,and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life
233,MAT,6,NRSV,and why do you worry about clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin
234,MAT,6,NRSV,yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
235,MAT,6,NRSV,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe youyou of little faith
236,MAT,6,NRSV,therefore do not worry saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear
237,MAT,6,NRSV,for it is the gentiles who strive for all these things and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things
238,MAT,6,NRSV,but strive first for the kingdom of god
239,MAT,6,NRSV,and his
240,MAT,6,NRSV,righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well
241,MAT,6,NRSV,so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring worries of its own todays trouble is enough for today
242,MAT,7,NRSV,do not judge so that you may not be judged
243,MAT,7,NRSV,for with the judgment you make you will be judged and the measure you give will be the measure you get
244,MAT,7,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors
245,MAT,7,NRSV,eye but do not notice the log in your own eye
246,MAT,7,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor
247,MAT,7,NRSV,let me take the speck out of your eye while the log is in your own eye
248,MAT,7,NRSV,you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors
249,MAT,7,NRSV,eye
250,MAT,7,NRSV,do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you
251,MAT,7,NRSV,ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you
252,MAT,7,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened
253,MAT,7,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for bread will give a stone
254,MAT,7,NRSV,or if the child asks for a fish will give a snake
255,MAT,7,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him
256,MAT,7,NRSV,in everything do to others as you would have them do to you for this is the law and the prophets
257,MAT,7,NRSV,enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is easy
258,MAT,7,NRSV,that leads to destruction and there are many who take it
259,MAT,7,NRSV,for the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life and there are few who find it
260,MAT,7,NRSV,beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
261,MAT,7,NRSV,you will know them by their fruits are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles
262,MAT,7,NRSV,in the same way every good tree bears good fruit but the bad tree bears bad fruit
263,MAT,7,NRSV,a good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit
264,MAT,7,NRSV,every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
265,MAT,7,NRSV,thus you will know them by their fruits
266,MAT,7,NRSV,not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will of my father in heaven
267,MAT,7,NRSV,on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many deeds of power in your name
268,MAT,7,NRSV,then i will declare to them i never knew you go away from me you evildoers
269,MAT,7,NRSV,everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock
270,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on rock
271,MAT,7,NRSV,and everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand
272,MAT,7,NRSV,the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it felland great was its fall
273,MAT,7,NRSV,now when jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were astounded at his teaching
274,MAT,7,NRSV,for he taught them as one having authority and not as their scribes
275,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus
276,MAT,8,NRSV,had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him
277,MAT,8,NRSV,and there was a leper
278,MAT,8,NRSV,who came to him and knelt before him saying lord if you choose you can make me clean
279,MAT,8,NRSV,he stretched out his hand and touched him saying i do choose be made clean immediately his leprosy
280,MAT,8,NRSV,was cleansed
281,MAT,8,NRSV,then jesus said to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded as a testimony to them
282,MAT,8,NRSV,when he entered capernaum a centurion came to him appealing to him
283,MAT,8,NRSV,and saying lord my servant is lying at home paralyzed in terrible distress
284,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to him i will come and cure him
285,MAT,8,NRSV,the centurion answered lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but only speak the word and my servant will be healed
286,MAT,8,NRSV,for i also am a man under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it
287,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus heard him he was amazed and said to those who followed him truly i tell you in no one
288,MAT,8,NRSV,in israel have i found such faith
289,MAT,8,NRSV,i tell you many will come from east and west and will eat with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
290,MAT,8,NRSV,while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
291,MAT,8,NRSV,and to the centurion jesus said go let it be done for you according to your faith and the servant was healed in that hour
292,MAT,8,NRSV,when jesus entered peters house he saw his motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever
293,MAT,8,NRSV,he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to serve him
294,MAT,8,NRSV,that evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and cured all who were sick
295,MAT,8,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases
296,MAT,8,NRSV,now when jesus saw great crowds around him he gave orders to go over to the other side
297,MAT,8,NRSV,a scribe then approached and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go
298,MAT,8,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
299,MAT,8,NRSV,another of his disciples said to him lord first let me go and bury my father
300,MAT,8,NRSV,but jesus said to him follow me and let the dead bury their own dead
301,MAT,8,NRSV,and when he got into the boat his disciples followed him
302,MAT,8,NRSV,a windstorm arose on the sea so great that the boat was being swamped by the waves but he was asleep
303,MAT,8,NRSV,and they went and woke him up saying lord save us we are perishing
304,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to them why are you afraid you of little faith then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a dead calm
305,MAT,8,NRSV,they were amazed saying what sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him
306,MAT,8,NRSV,when he came to the other side to the country of the gadarenes
307,MAT,8,NRSV,two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him they were so fierce that no one could pass that way
308,MAT,8,NRSV,suddenly they shouted what have you to do with us son of god have you come here to torment us before the time
309,MAT,8,NRSV,now a large herd of swine was feeding at some distance from them
310,MAT,8,NRSV,the demons begged him if you cast us out send us into the herd of swine
311,MAT,8,NRSV,and he said to them go so they came out and entered the swine and suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water
312,MAT,8,NRSV,the swineherds ran off and on going into the town they told the whole story about what had happened to the demoniacs
313,MAT,8,NRSV,then the whole town came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they begged him to leave their neighborhood
314,MAT,9,NRSV,and after getting into a boat he crossed the sea and came to his own town
315,MAT,9,NRSV,and just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic take heart son your sins are forgiven
316,MAT,9,NRSV,then some of the scribes said to themselves this man is blaspheming
317,MAT,9,NRSV,but jesus perceiving their thoughts said why do you think evil in your hearts
318,MAT,9,NRSV,for which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and walk
319,MAT,9,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe then said to the paralyticstand up take your bed and go to your home
320,MAT,9,NRSV,and he stood up and went to his home
321,MAT,9,NRSV,when the crowds saw it they were filled with awe and they glorified god who had given such authority to human beings
322,MAT,9,NRSV,as jesus was walking along he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me and he got up and followed him
323,MAT,9,NRSV,and as he sat at dinner
324,MAT,9,NRSV,in the house many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting
325,MAT,9,NRSV,with him and his disciples
326,MAT,9,NRSV,when the pharisees saw this they said to his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
327,MAT,9,NRSV,but when he heard this he said those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick
328,MAT,9,NRSV,go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice for i have come to call not the righteous but sinners
329,MAT,9,NRSV,then the disciples of john came to him saying why do we and the pharisees fast often
330,MAT,9,NRSV,but your disciples do not fast
331,MAT,9,NRSV,and jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them can they the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast
332,MAT,9,NRSV,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak for the patch pulls away from the cloak and a worse tear is made
333,MAT,9,NRSV,neither is new wine put into old wineskins otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed but new wine is put into fresh wineskins and so both are preserved
334,MAT,9,NRSV,while he was saying these things to them suddenly a leader of the synagogue
335,MAT,9,NRSV,came in and knelt before him saying my daughter has just died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live
336,MAT,9,NRSV,and jesus got up and followed him with his disciples
337,MAT,9,NRSV,then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak
338,MAT,9,NRSV,for she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be made well
339,MAT,9,NRSV,jesus turned and seeing her he said take heart daughter your faith has made you well and instantly the woman was made well
340,MAT,9,NRSV,when jesus came to the leaders house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion
341,MAT,9,NRSV,he said go away for the girl is not dead but sleeping and they laughed at him
342,MAT,9,NRSV,but when the crowd had been put outside he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up
343,MAT,9,NRSV,and the report of this spread throughout that district
344,MAT,9,NRSV,as jesus went on from there two blind men followed him crying loudly have mercy on us son of david
345,MAT,9,NRSV,when he entered the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them do you believe that i am able to do this they said to him yes lord
346,MAT,9,NRSV,then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done to you
347,MAT,9,NRSV,and their eyes were opened then jesus sternly ordered them see that no one knows of this
348,MAT,9,NRSV,but they went away and spread the news about him throughout that district
349,MAT,9,NRSV,after they had gone away a demoniac who was mute was brought to him
350,MAT,9,NRSV,and when the demon had been cast out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed and said never has anything like this been seen in israel
351,MAT,9,NRSV,but the pharisees said by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons
352,MAT,9,NRSV,then jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness
353,MAT,9,NRSV,when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
354,MAT,9,NRSV,then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few
355,MAT,9,NRSV,therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
356,MAT,10,NRSV,then jesus
357,MAT,10,NRSV,summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to cure every disease and every sickness
358,MAT,10,NRSV,these are the names of the twelve apostles first simon also known as peter and his brother andrew james son of zebedee and his brother john
359,MAT,10,NRSV,philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus
360,MAT,10,NRSV,simon the cananaean and judas iscariot the one who betrayed him
361,MAT,10,NRSV,these twelve jesus sent out with the following instructions go nowhere among the gentiles and enter no town of the samaritans
362,MAT,10,NRSV,but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
363,MAT,10,NRSV,as you go proclaim the good news the kingdom of heaven has come near
364,MAT,10,NRSV,cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers
365,MAT,10,NRSV,cast out demons you received without payment give without payment
366,MAT,10,NRSV,take no gold or silver or copper in your belts
367,MAT,10,NRSV,no bag for your journey or two tunics or sandals or a staff for laborers deserve their food
368,MAT,10,NRSV,whatever town or village you enter find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave
369,MAT,10,NRSV,as you enter the house greet it
370,MAT,10,NRSV,if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you
371,MAT,10,NRSV,if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town
372,MAT,10,NRSV,truly i tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town
373,MAT,10,NRSV,see i am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves
374,MAT,10,NRSV,beware of them for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues
375,MAT,10,NRSV,and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them and the gentiles
376,MAT,10,NRSV,when they hand you over do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say for what you are to say will be given to you at that time
377,MAT,10,NRSV,for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you
378,MAT,10,NRSV,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death
379,MAT,10,NRSV,and you will be hated by all because of my name but the one who endures to the end will be saved
380,MAT,10,NRSV,when they persecute you in one town flee to the next for truly i tell you you will not have gone through all the towns of israel before the son of man comes
381,MAT,10,NRSV,a disciple is not above the teacher nor a slave above the master
382,MAT,10,NRSV,it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher and the slave like the master if they have called the master of the house beelzebul how much more will they malign those of his household
383,MAT,10,NRSV,so have no fear of them for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
384,MAT,10,NRSV,what i say to you in the dark tell in the light and what you hear whispered proclaim from the housetops
385,MAT,10,NRSV,do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell
386,MAT,10,NRSV,are not two sparrows sold for a penny yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father
387,MAT,10,NRSV,and even the hairs of your head are all counted
388,MAT,10,NRSV,so do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows
389,MAT,10,NRSV,everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others i also will acknowledge before my father in heaven
390,MAT,10,NRSV,but whoever denies me before others i also will deny before my father in heaven
391,MAT,10,NRSV,do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth i have not come to bring peace but a sword
392,MAT,10,NRSV,for i have come to set a man against his father
393,MAT,10,NRSV,and a daughter against her mother
394,MAT,10,NRSV,and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
395,MAT,10,NRSV,and ones foes will be members of ones own household
396,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
397,MAT,10,NRSV,and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me
398,MAT,10,NRSV,those who find their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it
399,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me
400,MAT,10,NRSV,whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous
401,MAT,10,NRSV,and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a discipletruly i tell you none of these will lose their reward
402,MAT,11,NRSV,now when jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and proclaim his message in their cities
403,MAT,11,NRSV,when john heard in prison what the messiah
404,MAT,11,NRSV,was doing he sent word by his
405,MAT,11,NRSV,disciples
406,MAT,11,NRSV,and said to him are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another
407,MAT,11,NRSV,jesus answered them go and tell john what you hear and see
408,MAT,11,NRSV,the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers
409,MAT,11,NRSV,are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have good news brought to them
410,MAT,11,NRSV,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me
411,MAT,11,NRSV,as they went away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to look at a reed shaken by the wind
412,MAT,11,NRSV,what then did you go out to see someone
413,MAT,11,NRSV,dressed in soft robes look those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces
414,MAT,11,NRSV,what then did you go out to see a prophet
415,MAT,11,NRSV,yes i tell you and more than a prophet
416,MAT,11,NRSV,this is the one about whom it is written
417,MAT,11,NRSV,see i am sending my messenger ahead of you
418,MAT,11,NRSV,who will prepare your way before you
419,MAT,11,NRSV,truly i tell you among those born of women no one has arisen greater than john the baptist yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
420,MAT,11,NRSV,from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence
421,MAT,11,NRSV,and the violent take it by force
422,MAT,11,NRSV,for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john came
423,MAT,11,NRSV,and if you are willing to accept it he is elijah who is to come
424,MAT,11,NRSV,let anyone with ears
425,MAT,11,NRSV,listen
426,MAT,11,NRSV,but to what will i compare this generation it is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another
427,MAT,11,NRSV,we played the flute for you and you did not dance
428,MAT,11,NRSV,we wailed and you did not mourn
429,MAT,11,NRSV,for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a demon
430,MAT,11,NRSV,the son of man came eating and drinking and they say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds
431,MAT,11,NRSV,then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done because they did not repent
432,MAT,11,NRSV,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
433,MAT,11,NRSV,but i tell you on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you
434,MAT,11,NRSV,and you capernaum
435,MAT,11,NRSV,will you be exalted to heaven
436,MAT,11,NRSV,no you will be brought down to hades
437,MAT,11,NRSV,for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day
438,MAT,11,NRSV,but i tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom than for you
439,MAT,11,NRSV,at that time jesus said i thank
440,MAT,11,NRSV,you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants
441,MAT,11,NRSV,yes father for such was your gracious will
442,MAT,11,NRSV,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him
443,MAT,11,NRSV,come to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens and i will give you rest
444,MAT,11,NRSV,take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls
445,MAT,11,NRSV,for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
446,MAT,12,NRSV,at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples were hungry and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat
447,MAT,12,NRSV,when the pharisees saw it they said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath
448,MAT,12,NRSV,he said to them have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry
449,MAT,12,NRSV,he entered the house of god and ate the bread of the presence which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat but only for the priests
450,MAT,12,NRSV,or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless
451,MAT,12,NRSV,i tell you something greater than the temple is here
452,MAT,12,NRSV,but if you had known what this means i desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless
453,MAT,12,NRSV,for the son of man is lord of the sabbath
454,MAT,12,NRSV,he left that place and entered their synagogue
455,MAT,12,NRSV,a man was there with a withered hand and they asked him is it lawful to cure on the sabbath so that they might accuse him
456,MAT,12,NRSV,he said to them suppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath will you not lay hold of it and lift it out
457,MAT,12,NRSV,how much more valuable is a human being than a sheep so it is lawful to do good on the sabbath
458,MAT,12,NRSV,then he said to the man stretch out your hand he stretched it out and it was restored as sound as the other
459,MAT,12,NRSV,but the pharisees went out and conspired against him how to destroy him
460,MAT,12,NRSV,when jesus became aware of this he departed many crowds
461,MAT,12,NRSV,followed him and he cured all of them
462,MAT,12,NRSV,and he ordered them not to make him known
463,MAT,12,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet isaiah
464,MAT,12,NRSV,here is my servant whom i have chosen
465,MAT,12,NRSV,my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased
466,MAT,12,NRSV,i will put my spirit upon him
467,MAT,12,NRSV,and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles
468,MAT,12,NRSV,he will not wrangle or cry aloud
469,MAT,12,NRSV,nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets
470,MAT,12,NRSV,he will not break a bruised reed
471,MAT,12,NRSV,or quench a smoldering wick
472,MAT,12,NRSV,until he brings justice to victory
473,MAT,12,NRSV,and in his name the gentiles will hope
474,MAT,12,NRSV,then they brought to him a demoniac who was blind and mute and he cured him so that the one who had been mute could speak and see
475,MAT,12,NRSV,all the crowds were amazed and said can this be the son of david
476,MAT,12,NRSV,but when the pharisees heard it they said it is only by beelzebul the ruler of the demons that this fellow casts out the demons
477,MAT,12,NRSV,he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will stand
478,MAT,12,NRSV,if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand
479,MAT,12,NRSV,if i cast out demons by beelzebul by whom do your own exorcists
480,MAT,12,NRSV,cast them out therefore they will be your judges
481,MAT,12,NRSV,but if it is by the spirit of god that i cast out demons then the kingdom of god has come to you
482,MAT,12,NRSV,or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man then indeed the house can be plundered
483,MAT,12,NRSV,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
484,MAT,12,NRSV,therefore i tell you people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven
485,MAT,12,NRSV,whoever speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come
486,MAT,12,NRSV,either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for the tree is known by its fruit
487,MAT,12,NRSV,you brood of vipers how can you speak good things when you are evil for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
488,MAT,12,NRSV,the good person brings good things out of a good treasure and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure
489,MAT,12,NRSV,i tell you on the day of judgment you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter
490,MAT,12,NRSV,for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned
491,MAT,12,NRSV,then some of the scribes and pharisees said to him teacher we wish to see a sign from you
492,MAT,12,NRSV,but he answered them an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet jonah
493,MAT,12,NRSV,for just as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster so for three days and three nights the son of man will be in the heart of the earth
494,MAT,12,NRSV,the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here
495,MAT,12,NRSV,the queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here
496,MAT,12,NRSV,when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but it finds none
497,MAT,12,NRSV,then it says i will return to my house from which i came when it comes it finds it empty swept and put in order
498,MAT,12,NRSV,then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first so will it be also with this evil generation
499,MAT,12,NRSV,while he was still speaking to the crowds his mother and his brothers were standing outside wanting to speak to him
500,MAT,12,NRSV,someone told him look your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you
501,MAT,12,NRSV,but to the one who had told him this jesus
502,MAT,12,NRSV,replied who is my mother and who are my brothers
503,MAT,12,NRSV,and pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers
504,MAT,12,NRSV,for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
505,MAT,13,NRSV,that same day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea
506,MAT,13,NRSV,such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the whole crowd stood on the beach
507,MAT,13,NRSV,and he told them many things in parables saying listen a sower went out to sow
508,MAT,13,NRSV,and as he sowed some seeds fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up
509,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and they sprang up quickly since they had no depth of soil
510,MAT,13,NRSV,but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away
511,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them
512,MAT,13,NRSV,other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty
513,MAT,13,NRSV,let anyone with ears
514,MAT,13,NRSV,listen
515,MAT,13,NRSV,then the disciples came and asked him why do you speak to them in parables
516,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered to you it has been given to know the secrets
517,MAT,13,NRSV,of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given
518,MAT,13,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
519,MAT,13,NRSV,the reason i speak to them in parables is that seeing they do not perceive and hearing they do not listen nor do they understand
520,MAT,13,NRSV,with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah that says
521,MAT,13,NRSV,you will indeed listen but never understand
522,MAT,13,NRSV,and you will indeed look but never perceive
523,MAT,13,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull
524,MAT,13,NRSV,and their ears are hard of hearing
525,MAT,13,NRSV,and they have shut their eyes
526,MAT,13,NRSV,so that they might not look with their eyes
527,MAT,13,NRSV,and listen with their ears
528,MAT,13,NRSV,and understand with their heart and turn
529,MAT,13,NRSV,and i would heal them
530,MAT,13,NRSV,but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
531,MAT,13,NRSV,truly i tell you many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it
532,MAT,13,NRSV,hear then the parable of the sower
533,MAT,13,NRSV,when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path
534,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy
535,MAT,13,NRSV,yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away
536,MAT,13,NRSV,as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing
537,MAT,13,NRSV,but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty
538,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field
539,MAT,13,NRSV,but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away
540,MAT,13,NRSV,so when the plants came up and bore grain then the weeds appeared as well
541,MAT,13,NRSV,and the slaves of the householder came and said to him master did you not sow good seed in your field where then did these weeds come from
542,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered an enemy has done this the slaves said to him then do you want us to go and gather them
543,MAT,13,NRSV,but he replied no for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them
544,MAT,13,NRSV,let both of them grow together until the harvest and at harvest time i will tell the reapers collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn
545,MAT,13,NRSV,he put before them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field
546,MAT,13,NRSV,it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches
547,MAT,13,NRSV,he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with
548,MAT,13,NRSV,three measures of flour until all of it was leavened
549,MAT,13,NRSV,jesus told the crowds all these things in parables without a parable he told them nothing
550,MAT,13,NRSV,this was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet
551,MAT,13,NRSV,i will open my mouth to speak in parables
552,MAT,13,NRSV,i will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world
553,MAT,13,NRSV,then he left the crowds and went into the house and his disciples approached him saying explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field
554,MAT,13,NRSV,he answered the one who sows the good seed is the son of man
555,MAT,13,NRSV,the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one
556,MAT,13,NRSV,and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels
557,MAT,13,NRSV,just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age
558,MAT,13,NRSV,the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
559,MAT,13,NRSV,and they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
560,MAT,13,NRSV,then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father let anyone with ears
561,MAT,13,NRSV,listen
562,MAT,13,NRSV,the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
563,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls
564,MAT,13,NRSV,on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it
565,MAT,13,NRSV,again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind
566,MAT,13,NRSV,when it was full they drew it ashore sat down and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad
567,MAT,13,NRSV,so it will be at the end of the age the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
568,MAT,13,NRSV,and throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
569,MAT,13,NRSV,have you understood all this they answered yes
570,MAT,13,NRSV,and he said to them therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old
571,MAT,13,NRSV,when jesus had finished these parables he left that place
572,MAT,13,NRSV,he came to his hometown and began to teach the people
573,MAT,13,NRSV,in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power
574,MAT,13,NRSV,is not this the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and are not his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas
575,MAT,13,NRSV,and are not all his sisters with us where then did this man get all this
576,MAT,13,NRSV,and they took offense at him but jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house
577,MAT,13,NRSV,and he did not do many deeds of power there because of their unbelief
578,MAT,14,NRSV,at that time herod the ruler
579,MAT,14,NRSV,heard reports about jesus
580,MAT,14,NRSV,and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him
581,MAT,14,NRSV,for herod had arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife
582,MAT,14,NRSV,because john had been telling him it is not lawful for you to have her
583,MAT,14,NRSV,though herod
584,MAT,14,NRSV,wanted to put him to death he feared the crowd because they regarded him as a prophet
585,MAT,14,NRSV,but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced before the company and she pleased herod
586,MAT,14,NRSV,so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask
587,MAT,14,NRSV,prompted by her mother she said give me the head of john the baptist here on a platter
588,MAT,14,NRSV,the king was grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he commanded it to be given
589,MAT,14,NRSV,he sent and had john beheaded in the prison
590,MAT,14,NRSV,the head was brought on a platter and given to the girl who brought it to her mother
591,MAT,14,NRSV,his disciples came and took the body and buried it then they went and told jesus
592,MAT,14,NRSV,now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself but when the crowds heard it they followed him on foot from the towns
593,MAT,14,NRSV,when he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them and cured their sick
594,MAT,14,NRSV,when it was evening the disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves
595,MAT,14,NRSV,jesus said to them they need not go away you give them something to eat
596,MAT,14,NRSV,they replied we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish
597,MAT,14,NRSV,and he said bring them here to me
598,MAT,14,NRSV,then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
599,MAT,14,NRSV,and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full
600,MAT,14,NRSV,and those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children
601,MAT,14,NRSV,immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he dismissed the crowds
602,MAT,14,NRSV,and after he had dismissed the crowds he went up the mountain by himself to pray when evening came he was there alone
603,MAT,14,NRSV,but by this time the boat battered by the waves was far from the land
604,MAT,14,NRSV,for the wind was against them
605,MAT,14,NRSV,and early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea
606,MAT,14,NRSV,but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear
607,MAT,14,NRSV,but immediately jesus spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid
608,MAT,14,NRSV,peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
609,MAT,14,NRSV,he said come so peter got out of the boat started walking on the water and came toward jesus
610,MAT,14,NRSV,but when he noticed the strong wind
611,MAT,14,NRSV,he became frightened and beginning to sink he cried out lord save me
612,MAT,14,NRSV,jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him saying to him you of little faith why did you doubt
613,MAT,14,NRSV,when they got into the boat the wind ceased
614,MAT,14,NRSV,and those in the boat worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god
615,MAT,14,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret
616,MAT,14,NRSV,after the people of that place recognized him they sent word throughout the region and brought all who were sick to him
617,MAT,14,NRSV,and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed
618,MAT,15,NRSV,then pharisees and scribes came to jesus from jerusalem and said
619,MAT,15,NRSV,why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders for they do not wash their hands before they eat
620,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered them and why do you break the commandment of god for the sake of your tradition
621,MAT,15,NRSV,for god said
622,MAT,15,NRSV,honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die
623,MAT,15,NRSV,but you say that whoever tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is given to god
624,MAT,15,NRSV,then that person need not honor the father
625,MAT,15,NRSV,so for the sake of your tradition you make void the word
626,MAT,15,NRSV,of god
627,MAT,15,NRSV,you hypocrites isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said
628,MAT,15,NRSV,this people honors me with their lips
629,MAT,15,NRSV,but their hearts are far from me
630,MAT,15,NRSV,in vain do they worship me
631,MAT,15,NRSV,teaching human precepts as doctrines
632,MAT,15,NRSV,then he called the crowd to him and said to them listen and understand
633,MAT,15,NRSV,it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles
634,MAT,15,NRSV,then the disciples approached and said to him do you know that the pharisees took offense when they heard what you said
635,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be uprooted
636,MAT,15,NRSV,let them alone they are blind guides of the blind
637,MAT,15,NRSV,and if one blind person guides another both will fall into a pit
638,MAT,15,NRSV,but peter said to him explain this parable to us
639,MAT,15,NRSV,then he said are you also still without understanding
640,MAT,15,NRSV,do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer
641,MAT,15,NRSV,but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this is what defiles
642,MAT,15,NRSV,for out of the heart come evil intentions murder adultery fornication theft false witness slander
643,MAT,15,NRSV,these are what defile a person but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile
644,MAT,15,NRSV,jesus left that place and went away to the district of tyre and sidon
645,MAT,15,NRSV,just then a canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon
646,MAT,15,NRSV,but he did not answer her at all and his disciples came and urged him saying send her away for she keeps shouting after us
647,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
648,MAT,15,NRSV,but she came and knelt before him saying lord help me
649,MAT,15,NRSV,he answered it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
650,MAT,15,NRSV,she said yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
651,MAT,15,NRSV,then jesus answered her woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish and her daughter was healed instantly
652,MAT,15,NRSV,after jesus had left that place he passed along the sea of galilee and he went up the mountain where he sat down
653,MAT,15,NRSV,great crowds came to him bringing with them the lame the maimed the blind the mute and many others they put them at his feet and he cured them
654,MAT,15,NRSV,so that the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking the maimed whole the lame walking and the blind seeing and they praised the god of israel
655,MAT,15,NRSV,then jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat and i do not want to send them away hungry for they might faint on the way
656,MAT,15,NRSV,the disciples said to him where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd
657,MAT,15,NRSV,jesus asked them how many loaves have you they said seven and a few small fish
658,MAT,15,NRSV,then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground
659,MAT,15,NRSV,he took the seven loaves and the fish and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
660,MAT,15,NRSV,and all of them ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full
661,MAT,15,NRSV,those who had eaten were four thousand men besides women and children
662,MAT,15,NRSV,after sending away the crowds he got into the boat and went to the region of magadan
663,MAT,16,NRSV,the pharisees and sadducees came and to test jesus
664,MAT,16,NRSV,they asked him to show them a sign from heaven
665,MAT,16,NRSV,he answered them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red
666,MAT,16,NRSV,and in the morning it will be stormy today for the sky is red and threatening you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times
667,MAT,16,NRSV,an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah then he left them and went away
668,MAT,16,NRSV,when the disciples reached the other side they had forgotten to bring any bread
669,MAT,16,NRSV,jesus said to them watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
670,MAT,16,NRSV,they said to one another it is because we have brought no bread
671,MAT,16,NRSV,and becoming aware of it jesus said you of little faith why are you talking about having no bread
672,MAT,16,NRSV,do you still not perceive do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered
673,MAT,16,NRSV,or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered
674,MAT,16,NRSV,how could you fail to perceive that i was not speaking about bread beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
675,MAT,16,NRSV,then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of bread but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
676,MAT,16,NRSV,now when jesus came into the district of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples who do people say that the son of man is
677,MAT,16,NRSV,and they said some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
678,MAT,16,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am
679,MAT,16,NRSV,simon peter answered you are the messiah
680,MAT,16,NRSV,the son of the living god
681,MAT,16,NRSV,and jesus answered him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven
682,MAT,16,NRSV,and i tell you you are peter
683,MAT,16,NRSV,and on this rock
684,MAT,16,NRSV,i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it
685,MAT,16,NRSV,i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
686,MAT,16,NRSV,then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was
687,MAT,16,NRSV,the messiah
688,MAT,16,NRSV,from that time on jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised
689,MAT,16,NRSV,and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying god forbid it lord this must never happen to you
690,MAT,16,NRSV,but he turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things
691,MAT,16,NRSV,then jesus told his disciples if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me
692,MAT,16,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it
693,MAT,16,NRSV,for what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life or what will they give in return for their life
694,MAT,16,NRSV,for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay everyone for what has been done
695,MAT,16,NRSV,truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
696,MAT,17,NRSV,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and his brother john and led them up a high mountain by themselves
697,MAT,17,NRSV,and he was transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became dazzling white
698,MAT,17,NRSV,suddenly there appeared to them moses and elijah talking with him
699,MAT,17,NRSV,then peter said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you wish i
700,MAT,17,NRSV,will make three dwellings
701,MAT,17,NRSV,here one for you one for moses and one for elijah
702,MAT,17,NRSV,while he was still speaking suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud a voice said this is my son the beloved
703,MAT,17,NRSV,with him i am well pleased listen to him
704,MAT,17,NRSV,when the disciples heard this they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear
705,MAT,17,NRSV,but jesus came and touched them saying get up and do not be afraid
706,MAT,17,NRSV,and when they looked up they saw no one except jesus himself alone
707,MAT,17,NRSV,as they were coming down the mountain jesus ordered them tell no one about the vision until after the son of man has been raised from the dead
708,MAT,17,NRSV,and the disciples asked him why then do the scribes say that elijah must come first
709,MAT,17,NRSV,he replied elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things
710,MAT,17,NRSV,but i tell you that elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but they did to him whatever they pleased so also the son of man is about to suffer at their hands
711,MAT,17,NRSV,then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about john the baptist
712,MAT,17,NRSV,when they came to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him
713,MAT,17,NRSV,and said lord have mercy on my son for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly he often falls into the fire and often into the water
714,MAT,17,NRSV,and i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
715,MAT,17,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you how much longer must i put up with you bring him here to me
716,MAT,17,NRSV,and jesus rebuked the demon
717,MAT,17,NRSV,and it
718,MAT,17,NRSV,came out of him and the boy was cured instantly
719,MAT,17,NRSV,then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why could we not cast it out
720,MAT,17,NRSV,he said to them because of your little faith for truly i tell you if you have faith the size of a
721,MAT,17,NRSV,mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you
722,MAT,17,NRSV,as they were gathering
723,MAT,17,NRSV,in galilee jesus said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands
724,MAT,17,NRSV,and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised and they were greatly distressed
725,MAT,17,NRSV,when they reached capernaum the collectors of the temple tax
726,MAT,17,NRSV,came to peter and said does your teacher not pay the temple tax
727,MAT,17,NRSV,he said yes he does and when he came home jesus spoke of it first asking what do you think simon from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute from their children or from others
728,MAT,17,NRSV,when peter
729,MAT,17,NRSV,said from others jesus said to him then the children are free
730,MAT,17,NRSV,however so that we do not give offense to them go to the sea and cast a hook take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a coin
731,MAT,17,NRSV,take that and give it to them for you and me
732,MAT,18,NRSV,at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
733,MAT,18,NRSV,he called a child whom he put among them
734,MAT,18,NRSV,and said truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
735,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
736,MAT,18,NRSV,whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me
737,MAT,18,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea
738,MAT,18,NRSV,woe to the world because of stumbling blocks occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes
739,MAT,18,NRSV,if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire
740,MAT,18,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell
741,MAT,18,NRSV,of fire
742,MAT,18,NRSV,take care that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you in heaven their angels continually see the face of my father in heaven
743,MAT,18,NRSV,what do you think if a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray
744,MAT,18,NRSV,and if he finds it truly i tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray
745,MAT,18,NRSV,so it is not the will of your
746,MAT,18,NRSV,father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost
747,MAT,18,NRSV,if another member of the church
748,MAT,18,NRSV,sins against you
749,MAT,18,NRSV,go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone if the member listens to you you have regained that one
750,MAT,18,NRSV,but if you are not listened to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses
751,MAT,18,NRSV,if the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church let such a one be to you as a gentile and a tax collector
752,MAT,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
753,MAT,18,NRSV,again truly i tell you if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven
754,MAT,18,NRSV,for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them
755,MAT,18,NRSV,then peter came and said to him lord if another member of the church
756,MAT,18,NRSV,sins against me how often should i forgive as many as seven times
757,MAT,18,NRSV,jesus said to him not seven times but i tell you seventyseven
758,MAT,18,NRSV,times
759,MAT,18,NRSV,for this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves
760,MAT,18,NRSV,when he began the reckoning one who owed him ten thousand talents
761,MAT,18,NRSV,was brought to him
762,MAT,18,NRSV,and as he could not pay his lord ordered him to be sold together with his wife and children and all his possessions and payment to be made
763,MAT,18,NRSV,so the slave fell on his knees before him saying have patience with me and i will pay you everything
764,MAT,18,NRSV,and out of pity for him the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt
765,MAT,18,NRSV,but that same slave as he went out came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii
766,MAT,18,NRSV,and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe
767,MAT,18,NRSV,then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him have patience with me and i will pay you
768,MAT,18,NRSV,but he refused then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt
769,MAT,18,NRSV,when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place
770,MAT,18,NRSV,then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me
771,MAT,18,NRSV,should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave as i had mercy on you
772,MAT,18,NRSV,and in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt
773,MAT,18,NRSV,so my heavenly father will also do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother or sister
774,MAT,18,NRSV,from your heart
775,MAT,19,NRSV,when jesus had finished saying these things he left galilee and went to the region of judea beyond the jordan
776,MAT,19,NRSV,large crowds followed him and he cured them there
777,MAT,19,NRSV,some pharisees came to him and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause
778,MAT,19,NRSV,he answered have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female
779,MAT,19,NRSV,and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
780,MAT,19,NRSV,so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let no one separate
781,MAT,19,NRSV,they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her
782,MAT,19,NRSV,he said to them it was because you were so hardhearted that moses allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so
783,MAT,19,NRSV,and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for unchastity and marries another commits adultery
784,MAT,19,NRSV,his disciples said to him if such is the case of a man with his wife it is better not to marry
785,MAT,19,NRSV,but he said to them not everyone can accept this teaching but only those to whom it is given
786,MAT,19,NRSV,for there are eunuchs who have been so from birth and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven let anyone accept this who can
787,MAT,19,NRSV,then little children were being brought to him in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray the disciples spoke sternly to those who brought them
788,MAT,19,NRSV,but jesus said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs
789,MAT,19,NRSV,and he laid his hands on them and went on his way
790,MAT,19,NRSV,then someone came to him and said teacher what good deed must i do to have eternal life
791,MAT,19,NRSV,and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good there is only one who is good if you wish to enter into life keep the commandments
792,MAT,19,NRSV,he said to him which ones and jesus said you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness
793,MAT,19,NRSV,honor your father and mother also you shall love your neighbor as yourself
794,MAT,19,NRSV,the young man said to him i have kept all these
795,MAT,19,NRSV,what do i still lack
796,MAT,19,NRSV,jesus said to him if you wish to be perfect go sell your possessions and give the money
797,MAT,19,NRSV,to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
798,MAT,19,NRSV,when the young man heard this word he went away grieving for he had many possessions
799,MAT,19,NRSV,then jesus said to his disciples truly i tell you it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven
800,MAT,19,NRSV,again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
801,MAT,19,NRSV,when the disciples heard this they were greatly astounded and said then who can be saved
802,MAT,19,NRSV,but jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but for god all things are possible
803,MAT,19,NRSV,then peter said in reply look we have left everything and followed you what then will we have
804,MAT,19,NRSV,jesus said to them truly i tell you at the renewal of all things when the son of man is seated on the throne of his glory you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
805,MAT,19,NRSV,and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my names sake will receive a hundredfold
806,MAT,19,NRSV,and will inherit eternal life
807,MAT,19,NRSV,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first
808,MAT,20,NRSV,for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard
809,MAT,20,NRSV,after agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage
810,MAT,20,NRSV,he sent them into his vineyard
811,MAT,20,NRSV,when he went out about nine oclock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace
812,MAT,20,NRSV,and he said to them you also go into the vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right so they went
813,MAT,20,NRSV,when he went out again about noon and about three oclock he did the same
814,MAT,20,NRSV,and about five oclock he went out and found others standing around and he said to them why are you standing here idle all day
815,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him because no one has hired us he said to them you also go into the vineyard
816,MAT,20,NRSV,when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and then going to the first
817,MAT,20,NRSV,when those hired about five oclock came each of them received the usual daily wage
818,MAT,20,NRSV,now when the first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received the usual daily wage
819,MAT,20,NRSV,and when they received it they grumbled against the landowner
820,MAT,20,NRSV,saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat
821,MAT,20,NRSV,but he replied to one of them friend i am doing you no wrong did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage
822,MAT,20,NRSV,take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last the same as i give to you
823,MAT,20,NRSV,am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me or are you envious because i am generous
824,MAT,20,NRSV,so the last will be first and the first will be last
825,MAT,20,NRSV,while jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them on the way
826,MAT,20,NRSV,see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death
827,MAT,20,NRSV,then they will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified and on the third day he will be raised
828,MAT,20,NRSV,then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to him with her sons and kneeling before him she asked a favor of him
829,MAT,20,NRSV,and he said to her what do you want she said to him declare that these two sons of mine will sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom
830,MAT,20,NRSV,but jesus answered you do not know what you are asking are you able to drink the cup that i am about to drink
831,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him we are able
832,MAT,20,NRSV,he said to them you will indeed drink my cup but to sit at my right hand and at my left this is not mine to grant but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my father
833,MAT,20,NRSV,when the ten heard it they were angry with the two brothers
834,MAT,20,NRSV,but jesus called them to him and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them
835,MAT,20,NRSV,it will not be so among you but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant
836,MAT,20,NRSV,and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave
837,MAT,20,NRSV,just as the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
838,MAT,20,NRSV,as they were leaving jericho a large crowd followed him
839,MAT,20,NRSV,there were two blind men sitting by the roadside when they heard that jesus was passing by they shouted lord
840,MAT,20,NRSV,have mercy on us son of david
841,MAT,20,NRSV,the crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet but they shouted even more loudly have mercy on us lord son of david
842,MAT,20,NRSV,jesus stood still and called them saying what do you want me to do for you
843,MAT,20,NRSV,they said to him lord let our eyes be opened
844,MAT,20,NRSV,moved with compassion jesus touched their eyes immediately they regained their sight and followed him
845,MAT,21,NRSV,when they had come near jerusalem and had reached bethphage at the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples
846,MAT,21,NRSV,saying to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me
847,MAT,21,NRSV,if anyone says anything to you just say this the lord needs them and he will send them immediately
848,MAT,21,NRSV,
849,MAT,21,NRSV,this took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet saying
850,MAT,21,NRSV,tell the daughter of zion
851,MAT,21,NRSV,look your king is coming to you
852,MAT,21,NRSV,humble and mounted on a donkey
853,MAT,21,NRSV,and on a colt the foal of a donkey
854,MAT,21,NRSV,the disciples went and did as jesus had directed them
855,MAT,21,NRSV,they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and he sat on them
856,MAT,21,NRSV,a very large crowd
857,MAT,21,NRSV,spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road
858,MAT,21,NRSV,the crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting
859,MAT,21,NRSV,hosanna to the son of david
860,MAT,21,NRSV,blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
861,MAT,21,NRSV,hosanna in the highest heaven
862,MAT,21,NRSV,when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in turmoil asking who is this
863,MAT,21,NRSV,the crowds were saying this is the prophet jesus from nazareth in galilee
864,MAT,21,NRSV,then jesus entered the temple
865,MAT,21,NRSV,and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves
866,MAT,21,NRSV,he said to them it is written
867,MAT,21,NRSV,my house shall be called a house of prayer
868,MAT,21,NRSV,but you are making it a den of robbers
869,MAT,21,NRSV,the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he cured them
870,MAT,21,NRSV,but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did and heard
871,MAT,21,NRSV,the children crying out in the temple hosanna to the son of david they became angry
872,MAT,21,NRSV,and said to him do you hear what these are saying jesus said to them yes have you never read
873,MAT,21,NRSV,out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies
874,MAT,21,NRSV,you have prepared praise for yourself
875,MAT,21,NRSV,he left them went out of the city to bethany and spent the night there
876,MAT,21,NRSV,in the morning when he returned to the city he was hungry
877,MAT,21,NRSV,and seeing a fig tree by the side of the road he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves then he said to it may no fruit ever come from you again and the fig tree withered at once
878,MAT,21,NRSV,when the disciples saw it they were amazed saying how did the fig tree wither at once
879,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus answered them truly i tell you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will be done
880,MAT,21,NRSV,whatever you ask for in prayer with faith you will receive
881,MAT,21,NRSV,when he entered the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said by what authority are you doing these things and who gave you this authority
882,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them i will also ask you one question if you tell me the answer then i will also tell you by what authority i do these things
883,MAT,21,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin and they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not believe him
884,MAT,21,NRSV,but if we say of human origin we are afraid of the crowd for all regard john as a prophet
885,MAT,21,NRSV,so they answered jesus we do not know and he said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things
886,MAT,21,NRSV,what do you think a man had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work in the vineyard today
887,MAT,21,NRSV,he answered i will not but later he changed his mind and went
888,MAT,21,NRSV,the father
889,MAT,21,NRSV,went to the second and said the same and he answered i go sir but he did not go
890,MAT,21,NRSV,which of the two did the will of his father they said the first jesus said to them truly i tell you the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of god ahead of you
891,MAT,21,NRSV,for john came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him and even after you saw it you did not change your minds and believe him
892,MAT,21,NRSV,listen to another parable there was a landowner who planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a wine press in it and built a watchtower then he leased it to tenants and went to another country
893,MAT,21,NRSV,when the harvest time had come he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce
894,MAT,21,NRSV,but the tenants seized his slaves and beat one killed another and stoned another
895,MAT,21,NRSV,again he sent other slaves more than the first and they treated them in the same way
896,MAT,21,NRSV,finally he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son
897,MAT,21,NRSV,but when the tenants saw the son they said to themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and get his inheritance
898,MAT,21,NRSV,so they seized him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
899,MAT,21,NRSV,now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants
900,MAT,21,NRSV,they said to him he will put those wretches to a miserable death and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time
901,MAT,21,NRSV,jesus said to them have you never read in the scriptures
902,MAT,21,NRSV,the stone that the builders rejected
903,MAT,21,NRSV,has become the cornerstone
904,MAT,21,NRSV,this was the lords doing
905,MAT,21,NRSV,and it is amazing in our eyes
906,MAT,21,NRSV,therefore i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom
907,MAT,21,NRSV,the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces and it will crush anyone on whom it falls
908,MAT,21,NRSV,when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they realized that he was speaking about them
909,MAT,21,NRSV,they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet
910,MAT,22,NRSV,once more jesus spoke to them in parables saying
911,MAT,22,NRSV,the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son
912,MAT,22,NRSV,he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet but they would not come
913,MAT,22,NRSV,again he sent other slaves saying tell those who have been invited look i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet
914,MAT,22,NRSV,but they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his business
915,MAT,22,NRSV,while the rest seized his slaves mistreated them and killed them
916,MAT,22,NRSV,the king was enraged he sent his troops destroyed those murderers and burned their city
917,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to his slaves the wedding is ready but those invited were not worthy
918,MAT,22,NRSV,go therefore into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet
919,MAT,22,NRSV,those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found both good and bad so the wedding hall was filled with guests
920,MAT,22,NRSV,but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe
921,MAT,22,NRSV,and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding robe and he was speechless
922,MAT,22,NRSV,then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
923,MAT,22,NRSV,for many are called but few are chosen
924,MAT,22,NRSV,then the pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said
925,MAT,22,NRSV,so they sent their disciples to him along with the herodians saying teacher we know that you are sincere and teach the way of god in accordance with truth and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality
926,MAT,22,NRSV,tell us then what you think is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not
927,MAT,22,NRSV,but jesus aware of their malice said why are you putting me to the test you hypocrites
928,MAT,22,NRSV,show me the coin used for the tax and they brought him a denarius
929,MAT,22,NRSV,then he said to them whose head is this and whose title
930,MAT,22,NRSV,they answered the emperors then he said to them give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods
931,MAT,22,NRSV,when they heard this they were amazed and they left him and went away
932,MAT,22,NRSV,the same day some sadducees came to him saying there is no resurrection
933,MAT,22,NRSV,and they asked him a question saying
934,MAT,22,NRSV,teacher moses said if a man dies childless his brother shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
935,MAT,22,NRSV,now there were seven brothers among us the first married and died childless leaving the widow to his brother
936,MAT,22,NRSV,the second did the same so also the third down to the seventh
937,MAT,22,NRSV,last of all the woman herself died
938,MAT,22,NRSV,in the resurrection then whose wife of the seven will she be for all of them had married her
939,MAT,22,NRSV,jesus answered them you are wrong because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god
940,MAT,22,NRSV,for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels
941,MAT,22,NRSV,in heaven
942,MAT,22,NRSV,and as for the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was said to you by god
943,MAT,22,NRSV,i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is god not of the dead but of the living
944,MAT,22,NRSV,and when the crowd heard it they were astounded at his teaching
945,MAT,22,NRSV,when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they gathered together
946,MAT,22,NRSV,and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test him
947,MAT,22,NRSV,teacher which commandment in the law is the greatest
948,MAT,22,NRSV,he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
949,MAT,22,NRSV,this is the greatest and first commandment
950,MAT,22,NRSV,and a second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself
951,MAT,22,NRSV,on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
952,MAT,22,NRSV,now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them this question
953,MAT,22,NRSV,what do you think of the messiah
954,MAT,22,NRSV,whose son is he they said to him the son of david
955,MAT,22,NRSV,he said to them how is it then that david by the spirit
956,MAT,22,NRSV,calls him lord saying
957,MAT,22,NRSV,the lord said to my lord
958,MAT,22,NRSV,sit at my right hand
959,MAT,22,NRSV,until i put your enemies under your feet
960,MAT,22,NRSV,if david thus calls him lord how can he be his son
961,MAT,22,NRSV,no one was able to give him an answer nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions
962,MAT,23,NRSV,then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples
963,MAT,23,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat
964,MAT,23,NRSV,therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach
965,MAT,23,NRSV,they tie up heavy burdens hard to bear
966,MAT,23,NRSV,and lay them on the shoulders of others but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them
967,MAT,23,NRSV,they do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long
968,MAT,23,NRSV,they love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues
969,MAT,23,NRSV,and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi
970,MAT,23,NRSV,but you are not to be called rabbi for you have one teacher and you are all students
971,MAT,23,NRSV,and call no one your father on earth for you have one fatherthe one in heaven
972,MAT,23,NRSV,nor are you to be called instructors for you have one instructor the messiah
973,MAT,23,NRSV,the greatest among you will be your servant
974,MAT,23,NRSV,all who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves will be exalted
975,MAT,23,NRSV,but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven for you do not go in yourselves and when others are going in you stop them
976,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you cross sea and land to make a single convert and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell
977,MAT,23,NRSV,as yourselves
978,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you blind guides who say whoever swears by the sanctuary is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath
979,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind fools for which is greater the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred
980,MAT,23,NRSV,and you say whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath
981,MAT,23,NRSV,how blind you are for which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred
982,MAT,23,NRSV,so whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it
983,MAT,23,NRSV,and whoever swears by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who dwells in it
984,MAT,23,NRSV,and whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of god and by the one who is seated upon it
985,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others
986,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind guides you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel
987,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence
988,MAT,23,NRSV,you blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup
989,MAT,23,NRSV,so that the outside also may become clean
990,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside look beautiful but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth
991,MAT,23,NRSV,so you also on the outside look righteous to others but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness
992,MAT,23,NRSV,woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous
993,MAT,23,NRSV,and you say if we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets
994,MAT,23,NRSV,thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets
995,MAT,23,NRSV,fill up then the measure of your ancestors
996,MAT,23,NRSV,you snakes you brood of vipers how can you escape being sentenced to hell
997,MAT,23,NRSV,therefore i send you prophets sages and scribes some of whom you will kill and crucify and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town
998,MAT,23,NRSV,so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah son of barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar
999,MAT,23,NRSV,truly i tell you all this will come upon this generation
1000,MAT,23,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing
1001,MAT,23,NRSV,see your house is left to you desolate
1002,MAT,23,NRSV,for i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
1003,MAT,24,NRSV,as jesus came out of the temple and was going away his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple
1004,MAT,24,NRSV,then he asked them you see all these do you not truly i tell you not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down
1005,MAT,24,NRSV,when he was sitting on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when will this be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age
1006,MAT,24,NRSV,jesus answered them beware that no one leads you astray
1007,MAT,24,NRSV,for many will come in my name saying i am the messiah
1008,MAT,24,NRSV,and they will lead many astray
1009,MAT,24,NRSV,and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not alarmed for this must take place but the end is not yet
1010,MAT,24,NRSV,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines
1011,MAT,24,NRSV,and earthquakes in various places
1012,MAT,24,NRSV,all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs
1013,MAT,24,NRSV,then they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name
1014,MAT,24,NRSV,then many will fall away
1015,MAT,24,NRSV,and they will betray one another and hate one another
1016,MAT,24,NRSV,and many false prophets will arise and lead many astray
1017,MAT,24,NRSV,and because of the increase of lawlessness the love of many will grow cold
1018,MAT,24,NRSV,but the one who endures to the end will be saved
1019,MAT,24,NRSV,and this good news
1020,MAT,24,NRSV,of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come
1021,MAT,24,NRSV,so when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place as was spoken of by the prophet daniel let the reader understand
1022,MAT,24,NRSV,then those in judea must flee to the mountains
1023,MAT,24,NRSV,the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house
1024,MAT,24,NRSV,the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat
1025,MAT,24,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days
1026,MAT,24,NRSV,pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath
1027,MAT,24,NRSV,for at that time there will be great suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no and never will be
1028,MAT,24,NRSV,and if those days had not been cut short no one would be saved but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short
1029,MAT,24,NRSV,then if anyone says to you look here is the messiah
1030,MAT,24,NRSV,or there he isdo not believe it
1031,MAT,24,NRSV,for false messiahs
1032,MAT,24,NRSV,and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens to lead astray if possible even the elect
1033,MAT,24,NRSV,take note i have told you beforehand
1034,MAT,24,NRSV,so if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out if they say look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
1035,MAT,24,NRSV,for as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west so will be the coming of the son of man
1036,MAT,24,NRSV,wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather
1037,MAT,24,NRSV,immediately after the suffering of those days
1038,MAT,24,NRSV,the sun will be darkened
1039,MAT,24,NRSV,and the moon will not give its light
1040,MAT,24,NRSV,the stars will fall from heaven
1041,MAT,24,NRSV,and the powers of heaven will be shaken
1042,MAT,24,NRSV,then the sign of the son of man will appear in heaven and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
1043,MAT,24,NRSV,and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
1044,MAT,24,NRSV,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near
1045,MAT,24,NRSV,so also when you see all these things you know that he
1046,MAT,24,NRSV,is near at the very gates
1047,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place
1048,MAT,24,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
1049,MAT,24,NRSV,but about that day and hour no one knows neither the angels of heaven nor the son
1050,MAT,24,NRSV,but only the father
1051,MAT,24,NRSV,for as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man
1052,MAT,24,NRSV,for as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day noah entered the ark
1053,MAT,24,NRSV,and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away so too will be the coming of the son of man
1054,MAT,24,NRSV,then two will be in the field one will be taken and one will be left
1055,MAT,24,NRSV,two women will be grinding meal together one will be taken and one will be left
1056,MAT,24,NRSV,keep awake therefore for you do not know on what day
1057,MAT,24,NRSV,your lord is coming
1058,MAT,24,NRSV,but understand this if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into
1059,MAT,24,NRSV,therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour
1060,MAT,24,NRSV,who then is the faithful and wise slave whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the other slaves
1061,MAT,24,NRSV,their allowance of food at the proper time
1062,MAT,24,NRSV,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives
1063,MAT,24,NRSV,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions
1064,MAT,24,NRSV,but if that wicked slave says to himself my master is delayed
1065,MAT,24,NRSV,and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards
1066,MAT,24,NRSV,the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know
1067,MAT,24,NRSV,he will cut him in pieces
1068,MAT,24,NRSV,and put him with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1069,MAT,25,NRSV,then the kingdom of heaven will be like this ten bridesmaids
1070,MAT,25,NRSV,took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom
1071,MAT,25,NRSV,five of them were foolish and five were wise
1072,MAT,25,NRSV,when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them
1073,MAT,25,NRSV,but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps
1074,MAT,25,NRSV,as the bridegroom was delayed all of them became drowsy and slept
1075,MAT,25,NRSV,but at midnight there was a shout look here is the bridegroom come out to meet him
1076,MAT,25,NRSV,then all those bridesmaids
1077,MAT,25,NRSV,got up and trimmed their lamps
1078,MAT,25,NRSV,the foolish said to the wise give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out
1079,MAT,25,NRSV,but the wise replied no there will not be enough for you and for us you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves
1080,MAT,25,NRSV,and while they went to buy it the bridegroom came and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet and the door was shut
1081,MAT,25,NRSV,later the other bridesmaids
1082,MAT,25,NRSV,came also saying lord lord open to us
1083,MAT,25,NRSV,but he replied truly i tell you i do not know you
1084,MAT,25,NRSV,keep awake therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour
1085,MAT,25,NRSV,for it is as if a man going on a journey summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them
1086,MAT,25,NRSV,to one he gave five talents
1087,MAT,25,NRSV,to another two to another one to each according to his ability then he went away
1088,MAT,25,NRSV,the one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them and made five more talents
1089,MAT,25,NRSV,in the same way the one who had the two talents made two more talents
1090,MAT,25,NRSV,but the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money
1091,MAT,25,NRSV,after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them
1092,MAT,25,NRSV,then the one who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more talents saying master you handed over to me five talents see i have made five more talents
1093,MAT,25,NRSV,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master
1094,MAT,25,NRSV,and the one with the two talents also came forward saying master you handed over to me two talents see i have made two more talents
1095,MAT,25,NRSV,his master said to him well done good and trustworthy slave you have been trustworthy in a few things i will put you in charge of many things enter into the joy of your master
1096,MAT,25,NRSV,then the one who had received the one talent also came forward saying master i knew that you were a harsh man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed
1097,MAT,25,NRSV,so i was afraid and i went and hid your talent in the ground here you have what is yours
1098,MAT,25,NRSV,but his master replied you wicked and lazy slave you knew did you that i reap where i did not sow and gather where i did not scatter
1099,MAT,25,NRSV,then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and on my return i would have received what was my own with interest
1100,MAT,25,NRSV,so take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents
1101,MAT,25,NRSV,for to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
1102,MAT,25,NRSV,as for this worthless slave throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1103,MAT,25,NRSV,when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory
1104,MAT,25,NRSV,all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
1105,MAT,25,NRSV,and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left
1106,MAT,25,NRSV,then the king will say to those at his right hand come you that are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
1107,MAT,25,NRSV,for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you welcomed me
1108,MAT,25,NRSV,i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you took care of me i was in prison and you visited me
1109,MAT,25,NRSV,then the righteous will answer him lord when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food or thirsty and gave you something to drink
1110,MAT,25,NRSV,and when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you or naked and gave you clothing
1111,MAT,25,NRSV,and when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you
1112,MAT,25,NRSV,and the king will answer them truly i tell you just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family
1113,MAT,25,NRSV,you did it to me
1114,MAT,25,NRSV,then he will say to those at his left hand you that are accursed depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
1115,MAT,25,NRSV,for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink
1116,MAT,25,NRSV,i was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not give me clothing sick and in prison and you did not visit me
1117,MAT,25,NRSV,then they also will answer lord when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not take care of you
1118,MAT,25,NRSV,then he will answer them truly i tell you just as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me
1119,MAT,25,NRSV,and these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life
1120,MAT,26,NRSV,when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples
1121,MAT,26,NRSV,you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified
1122,MAT,26,NRSV,then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas
1123,MAT,26,NRSV,and they conspired to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him
1124,MAT,26,NRSV,but they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people
1125,MAT,26,NRSV,now while jesus was at bethany in the house of simon the leper
1126,MAT,26,NRSV,a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table
1127,MAT,26,NRSV,but when the disciples saw it they were angry and said why this waste
1128,MAT,26,NRSV,for this ointment could have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor
1129,MAT,26,NRSV,but jesus aware of this said to them why do you trouble the woman she has performed a good service for me
1130,MAT,26,NRSV,for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
1131,MAT,26,NRSV,by pouring this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial
1132,MAT,26,NRSV,truly i tell you wherever this good news
1133,MAT,26,NRSV,is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her
1134,MAT,26,NRSV,then one of the twelve who was called judas iscariot went to the chief priests
1135,MAT,26,NRSV,and said what will you give me if i betray him to you they paid him thirty pieces of silver
1136,MAT,26,NRSV,and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him
1137,MAT,26,NRSV,on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the passover
1138,MAT,26,NRSV,he said go into the city to a certain man and say to him the teacher says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples
1139,MAT,26,NRSV,so the disciples did as jesus had directed them and they prepared the passover meal
1140,MAT,26,NRSV,when it was evening he took his place with the twelve
1141,MAT,26,NRSV,and while they were eating he said truly i tell you one of you will betray me
1142,MAT,26,NRSV,and they became greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another surely not i lord
1143,MAT,26,NRSV,he answered the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me
1144,MAT,26,NRSV,the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born
1145,MAT,26,NRSV,judas who betrayed him said surely not i rabbi he replied you have said so
1146,MAT,26,NRSV,while they were eating jesus took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body
1147,MAT,26,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you
1148,MAT,26,NRSV,for this is my blood of the
1149,MAT,26,NRSV,covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
1150,MAT,26,NRSV,i tell you i will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom
1151,MAT,26,NRSV,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives
1152,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus said to them you will all become deserters because of me this night for it is written
1153,MAT,26,NRSV,i will strike the shepherd
1154,MAT,26,NRSV,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
1155,MAT,26,NRSV,but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you to galilee
1156,MAT,26,NRSV,peter said to him though all become deserters because of you i will never desert you
1157,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him truly i tell you this very night before the cock crows you will deny me three times
1158,MAT,26,NRSV,peter said to him even though i must die with you i will not deny you and so said all the disciples
1159,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus went with them to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i go over there and pray
1160,MAT,26,NRSV,he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be grieved and agitated
1161,MAT,26,NRSV,then he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and stay awake with me
1162,MAT,26,NRSV,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed my father if it is possible let this cup pass from me yet not what i want but what you want
1163,MAT,26,NRSV,then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping and he said to peter so could you not stay awake with me one hour
1164,MAT,26,NRSV,stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial
1165,MAT,26,NRSV,the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
1166,MAT,26,NRSV,again he went away for the second time and prayed my father if this cannot pass unless i drink it your will be done
1167,MAT,26,NRSV,again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy
1168,MAT,26,NRSV,so leaving them again he went away and prayed for the third time saying the same words
1169,MAT,26,NRSV,then he came to the disciples and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest see the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
1170,MAT,26,NRSV,get up let us be going see my betrayer is at hand
1171,MAT,26,NRSV,while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and the elders of the people
1172,MAT,26,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him
1173,MAT,26,NRSV,at once he came up to jesus and said greetings rabbi and kissed him
1174,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him friend do what you are here to do then they came and laid hands on jesus and arrested him
1175,MAT,26,NRSV,suddenly one of those with jesus put his hand on his sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear
1176,MAT,26,NRSV,then jesus said to him put your sword back into its place for all who take the sword will perish by the sword
1177,MAT,26,NRSV,do you think that i cannot appeal to my father and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels
1178,MAT,26,NRSV,but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled which say it must happen in this way
1179,MAT,26,NRSV,at that hour jesus said to the crowds have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though i were a bandit day after day i sat in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me
1180,MAT,26,NRSV,but all this has taken place so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled then all the disciples deserted him and fled
1181,MAT,26,NRSV,those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered
1182,MAT,26,NRSV,but peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and going inside he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end
1183,MAT,26,NRSV,now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against jesus so that they might put him to death
1184,MAT,26,NRSV,but they found none though many false witnesses came forward at last two came forward
1185,MAT,26,NRSV,and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
1186,MAT,26,NRSV,the high priest stood up and said have you no answer what is it that they testify against you
1187,MAT,26,NRSV,but jesus was silent then the high priest said to him i put you under oath before the living god tell us if you are the messiah
1188,MAT,26,NRSV,the son of god
1189,MAT,26,NRSV,jesus said to him you have said so but i tell you
1190,MAT,26,NRSV,from now on you will see the son of man
1191,MAT,26,NRSV,seated at the right hand of power
1192,MAT,26,NRSV,and coming on the clouds of heaven
1193,MAT,26,NRSV,then the high priest tore his clothes and said he has blasphemed why do we still need witnesses you have now heard his blasphemy
1194,MAT,26,NRSV,what is your verdict they answered he deserves death
1195,MAT,26,NRSV,then they spat in his face and struck him and some slapped him
1196,MAT,26,NRSV,saying prophesy to us you messiah
1197,MAT,26,NRSV,who is it that struck you
1198,MAT,26,NRSV,now peter was sitting outside in the courtyard a servantgirl came to him and said you also were with jesus the galilean
1199,MAT,26,NRSV,but he denied it before all of them saying i do not know what you are talking about
1200,MAT,26,NRSV,when he went out to the porch another servantgirl saw him and she said to the bystanders this man was with jesus of nazareth
1201,MAT,26,NRSV,again he denied it with an oath i do not know the man
1202,MAT,26,NRSV,after a little while the bystanders came up and said to peter certainly you are also one of them for your accent betrays you
1203,MAT,26,NRSV,then he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know the man at that moment the cock crowed
1204,MAT,26,NRSV,then peter remembered what jesus had said before the cock crows you will deny me three times and he went out and wept bitterly
1205,MAT,27,NRSV,when morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against jesus in order to bring about his death
1206,MAT,27,NRSV,they bound him led him away and handed him over to pilate the governor
1207,MAT,27,NRSV,when judas his betrayer saw that jesus
1208,MAT,27,NRSV,was condemned he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders
1209,MAT,27,NRSV,he said i have sinned by betraying innocent
1210,MAT,27,NRSV,blood but they said what is that to us see to it yourself
1211,MAT,27,NRSV,throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple he departed and he went and hanged himself
1212,MAT,27,NRSV,but the chief priests taking the pieces of silver said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury since they are blood money
1213,MAT,27,NRSV,after conferring together they used them to buy the potters field as a place to bury foreigners
1214,MAT,27,NRSV,for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day
1215,MAT,27,NRSV,then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet jeremiah
1216,MAT,27,NRSV,and they took
1217,MAT,27,NRSV,the thirty pieces of silver the price of the one on whom a price had been set
1218,MAT,27,NRSV,on whom some of the people of israel had set a price
1219,MAT,27,NRSV,and they gave
1220,MAT,27,NRSV,them for the potters field as the lord commanded me
1221,MAT,27,NRSV,now jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him are you the king of the jews jesus said you say so
1222,MAT,27,NRSV,but when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he did not answer
1223,MAT,27,NRSV,then pilate said to him do you not hear how many accusations they make against you
1224,MAT,27,NRSV,but he gave him no answer not even to a single charge so that the governor was greatly amazed
1225,MAT,27,NRSV,now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd anyone whom they wanted
1226,MAT,27,NRSV,at that time they had a notorious prisoner called jesus
1227,MAT,27,NRSV,barabbas
1228,MAT,27,NRSV,so after they had gathered pilate said to them whom do you want me to release for you jesus
1229,MAT,27,NRSV,barabbas or jesus who is called the messiah
1230,MAT,27,NRSV,for he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over
1231,MAT,27,NRSV,while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent word to him have nothing to do with that innocent man for today i have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him
1232,MAT,27,NRSV,now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for barabbas and to have jesus killed
1233,MAT,27,NRSV,the governor again said to them which of the two do you want me to release for you and they said barabbas
1234,MAT,27,NRSV,pilate said to them then what should i do with jesus who is called the messiah
1235,MAT,27,NRSV,all of them said let him be crucified
1236,MAT,27,NRSV,then he asked why what evil has he done but they shouted all the more let him be crucified
1237,MAT,27,NRSV,so when pilate saw that he could do nothing but rather that a riot was beginning he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd saying i am innocent of this mans blood
1238,MAT,27,NRSV,see to it yourselves
1239,MAT,27,NRSV,then the people as a whole answered his blood be on us and on our children
1240,MAT,27,NRSV,so he released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified
1241,MAT,27,NRSV,then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the governors headquarters
1242,MAT,27,NRSV,and they gathered the whole cohort around him
1243,MAT,27,NRSV,they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him
1244,MAT,27,NRSV,and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on his head they put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews
1245,MAT,27,NRSV,they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head
1246,MAT,27,NRSV,after mocking him they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him then they led him away to crucify him
1247,MAT,27,NRSV,as they went out they came upon a man from cyrene named simon they compelled this man to carry his cross
1248,MAT,27,NRSV,and when they came to a place called golgotha which means place of a skull
1249,MAT,27,NRSV,they offered him wine to drink mixed with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it
1250,MAT,27,NRSV,and when they had crucified him they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots
1251,MAT,27,NRSV,then they sat down there and kept watch over him
1252,MAT,27,NRSV,over his head they put the charge against him which read this is jesus the king of the jews
1253,MAT,27,NRSV,then two bandits were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left
1254,MAT,27,NRSV,those who passed by derided
1255,MAT,27,NRSV,him shaking their heads
1256,MAT,27,NRSV,and saying you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself if you are the son of god come down from the cross
1257,MAT,27,NRSV,in the same way the chief priests also along with the scribes and elders were mocking him saying
1258,MAT,27,NRSV,he saved others he cannot save himself
1259,MAT,27,NRSV,he is the king of israel let him come down from the cross now and we will believe in him
1260,MAT,27,NRSV,he trusts in god let god deliver him now if he wants to for he said i am gods son
1261,MAT,27,NRSV,the bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way
1262,MAT,27,NRSV,from noon on darkness came over the whole land
1263,MAT,27,NRSV,until three in the afternoon
1264,MAT,27,NRSV,and about three oclock jesus cried with a loud voice eli eli lema sabachthani that is my god my god why have you forsaken me
1265,MAT,27,NRSV,when some of the bystanders heard it they said this man is calling for elijah
1266,MAT,27,NRSV,at once one of them ran and got a sponge filled it with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink
1267,MAT,27,NRSV,but the others said wait let us see whether elijah will come to save him
1268,MAT,27,NRSV,then jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last
1269,MAT,27,NRSV,at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom the earth shook and the rocks were split
1270,MAT,27,NRSV,the tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised
1271,MAT,27,NRSV,after his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many
1272,MAT,27,NRSV,now when the centurion and those with him who were keeping watch over jesus saw the earthquake and what took place they were terrified and said truly this man was gods son
1273,MAT,27,NRSV,many women were also there looking on from a distance they had followed jesus from galilee and had provided for him
1274,MAT,27,NRSV,among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joseph and the mother of the sons of zebedee
1275,MAT,27,NRSV,when it was evening there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who was also a disciple of jesus
1276,MAT,27,NRSV,he went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus then pilate ordered it to be given to him
1277,MAT,27,NRSV,so joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
1278,MAT,27,NRSV,and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn in the rock he then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away
1279,MAT,27,NRSV,mary magdalene and the other mary were there sitting opposite the tomb
1280,MAT,27,NRSV,the next day that is after the day of preparation the chief priests and the pharisees gathered before pilate
1281,MAT,27,NRSV,and said sir we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive after three days i will rise again
1282,MAT,27,NRSV,therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away and tell the people he has been raised from the dead and the last deception would be worse than the first
1283,MAT,27,NRSV,pilate said to them you have a guard
1284,MAT,27,NRSV,of soldiers go make it as secure as you can
1285,MAT,27,NRSV,so they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone
1286,MAT,28,NRSV,after the sabbath as the first day of the week was dawning mary magdalene and the other mary went to see the tomb
1287,MAT,28,NRSV,and suddenly there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descending from heaven came and rolled back the stone and sat on it
1288,MAT,28,NRSV,his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow
1289,MAT,28,NRSV,for fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men
1290,MAT,28,NRSV,but the angel said to the women do not be afraid i know that you are looking for jesus who was crucified
1291,MAT,28,NRSV,he is not here for he has been raised as he said come see the place where he
1292,MAT,28,NRSV,lay
1293,MAT,28,NRSV,then go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead
1294,MAT,28,NRSV,and indeed he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him this is my message for you
1295,MAT,28,NRSV,so they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples
1296,MAT,28,NRSV,suddenly jesus met them and said greetings and they came to him took hold of his feet and worshiped him
1297,MAT,28,NRSV,then jesus said to them do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to galilee there they will see me
1298,MAT,28,NRSV,while they were going some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened
1299,MAT,28,NRSV,after the priests
1300,MAT,28,NRSV,had assembled with the elders they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers
1301,MAT,28,NRSV,telling them you must say his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep
1302,MAT,28,NRSV,if this comes to the governors ears we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble
1303,MAT,28,NRSV,so they took the money and did as they were directed and this story is still told among the jews to this day
1304,MAT,28,NRSV,now the eleven disciples went to galilee to the mountain to which jesus had directed them
1305,MAT,28,NRSV,when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted
1306,MAT,28,NRSV,and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
1307,MAT,28,NRSV,go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
1308,MAT,28,NRSV,and teaching them to obey everything that i have commanded you and remember i am with you always to the end of the age
1309,MRK,1,NRSV,the beginning of the good news
1310,MRK,1,NRSV,of jesus christ the son of god
1311,MRK,1,NRSV,as it is written in the prophet isaiah
1312,MRK,1,NRSV,see i am sending my messenger ahead of you
1313,MRK,1,NRSV,who will prepare your way
1314,MRK,1,NRSV,the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
1315,MRK,1,NRSV,prepare the way of the lord
1316,MRK,1,NRSV,make his paths straight
1317,MRK,1,NRSV,john the baptizer appeared
1318,MRK,1,NRSV,in the wilderness proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins
1319,MRK,1,NRSV,and people from the whole judean countryside and all the people of jerusalem were going out to him and were baptized by him in the river jordan confessing their sins
1320,MRK,1,NRSV,now john was clothed with camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey
1321,MRK,1,NRSV,he proclaimed the one who is more powerful than i is coming after me i am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals
1322,MRK,1,NRSV,i have baptized you with
1323,MRK,1,NRSV,water but he will baptize you with
1324,MRK,1,NRSV,the holy spirit
1325,MRK,1,NRSV,in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan
1326,MRK,1,NRSV,and just as he was coming up out of the water he saw the heavens torn apart and the spirit descending like a dove on him
1327,MRK,1,NRSV,and a voice came from heaven you are my son the beloved
1328,MRK,1,NRSV,with you i am well pleased
1329,MRK,1,NRSV,and the spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness
1330,MRK,1,NRSV,he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels waited on him
1331,MRK,1,NRSV,now after john was arrested jesus came to galilee proclaiming the good news
1332,MRK,1,NRSV,of god
1333,MRK,1,NRSV,and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near
1334,MRK,1,NRSV,repent and believe in the good news
1335,MRK,1,NRSV,as jesus passed along the sea of galilee he saw simon and his brother andrew casting a net into the seafor they were fishermen
1336,MRK,1,NRSV,and jesus said to them follow me and i will make you fish for people
1337,MRK,1,NRSV,and immediately they left their nets and followed him
1338,MRK,1,NRSV,as he went a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john who were in their boat mending the nets
1339,MRK,1,NRSV,immediately he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him
1340,MRK,1,NRSV,they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came he entered the synagogue and taught
1341,MRK,1,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes
1342,MRK,1,NRSV,just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit
1343,MRK,1,NRSV,and he cried out what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you are the holy one of god
1344,MRK,1,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him
1345,MRK,1,NRSV,and the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him
1346,MRK,1,NRSV,they were all amazed and they kept on asking one another what is this a new teachingwith authority he
1347,MRK,1,NRSV,commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him
1348,MRK,1,NRSV,at once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of galilee
1349,MRK,1,NRSV,as soon as they
1350,MRK,1,NRSV,left the synagogue they entered the house of simon and andrew with james and john
1351,MRK,1,NRSV,now simons motherinlaw was in bed with a fever and they told him about her at once
1352,MRK,1,NRSV,he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up then the fever left her and she began to serve them
1353,MRK,1,NRSV,that evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons
1354,MRK,1,NRSV,and the whole city was gathered around the door
1355,MRK,1,NRSV,and he cured many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons and he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him
1356,MRK,1,NRSV,in the morning while it was still very dark he got up and went out to a deserted place and there he prayed
1357,MRK,1,NRSV,and simon and his companions hunted for him
1358,MRK,1,NRSV,when they found him they said to him everyone is searching for you
1359,MRK,1,NRSV,he answered let us go on to the neighboring towns so that i may proclaim the message there also for that is what i came out to do
1360,MRK,1,NRSV,and he went throughout galilee proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons
1361,MRK,1,NRSV,a leper
1362,MRK,1,NRSV,came to him begging him and kneeling
1363,MRK,1,NRSV,he said to him if you choose you can make me clean
1364,MRK,1,NRSV,moved with pity
1365,MRK,1,NRSV,jesus
1366,MRK,1,NRSV,stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him i do choose be made clean
1367,MRK,1,NRSV,immediately the leprosy
1368,MRK,1,NRSV,left him and he was made clean
1369,MRK,1,NRSV,after sternly warning him he sent him away at once
1370,MRK,1,NRSV,saying to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what moses commanded as a testimony to them
1371,MRK,1,NRSV,but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that jesus
1372,MRK,1,NRSV,could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter
1373,MRK,2,NRSV,when he returned to capernaum after some days it was reported that he was at home
1374,MRK,2,NRSV,so many gathered around that there was no longer room for them not even in front of the door and he was speaking the word to them
1375,MRK,2,NRSV,then some people
1376,MRK,2,NRSV,came bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four of them
1377,MRK,2,NRSV,and when they could not bring him to jesus because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and after having dug through it they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay
1378,MRK,2,NRSV,when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven
1379,MRK,2,NRSV,now some of the scribes were sitting there questioning in their hearts
1380,MRK,2,NRSV,why does this fellow speak in this way it is blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone
1381,MRK,2,NRSV,at once jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves and he said to them why do you raise such questions in your hearts
1382,MRK,2,NRSV,which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say stand up and take your mat and walk
1383,MRK,2,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralytic
1384,MRK,2,NRSV,i say to you stand up take your mat and go to your home
1385,MRK,2,NRSV,and he stood up and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them so that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we have never seen anything like this
1386,MRK,2,NRSV,jesus
1387,MRK,2,NRSV,went out again beside the sea the whole crowd gathered around him and he taught them
1388,MRK,2,NRSV,as he was walking along he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me and he got up and followed him
1389,MRK,2,NRSV,and as he sat at dinner
1390,MRK,2,NRSV,in levis
1391,MRK,2,NRSV,house many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting
1392,MRK,2,NRSV,with jesus and his disciplesfor there were many who followed him
1393,MRK,2,NRSV,when the scribes of
1394,MRK,2,NRSV,the pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors they said to his disciples why does he eat
1395,MRK,2,NRSV,with tax collectors and sinners
1396,MRK,2,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to them those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have come to call not the righteous but sinners
1397,MRK,2,NRSV,now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting and people
1398,MRK,2,NRSV,came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast
1399,MRK,2,NRSV,jesus said to them the wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them can they as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
1400,MRK,2,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast on that day
1401,MRK,2,NRSV,no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak otherwise the patch pulls away from it the new from the old and a worse tear is made
1402,MRK,2,NRSV,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost and so are the skins but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins
1403,MRK,2,NRSV,one sabbath he was going through the grainfields and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain
1404,MRK,2,NRSV,the pharisees said to him look why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath
1405,MRK,2,NRSV,and he said to them have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food
1406,MRK,2,NRSV,he entered the house of god when abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the presence which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and he gave some to his companions
1407,MRK,2,NRSV,then he said to them the sabbath was made for humankind and not humankind for the sabbath
1408,MRK,2,NRSV,so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
1409,MRK,3,NRSV,again he entered the synagogue and a man was there who had a withered hand
1410,MRK,3,NRSV,they watched him to see whether he would cure him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him
1411,MRK,3,NRSV,and he said to the man who had the withered hand come forward
1412,MRK,3,NRSV,then he said to them is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to kill but they were silent
1413,MRK,3,NRSV,he looked around at them with anger he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man stretch out your hand he stretched it out and his hand was restored
1414,MRK,3,NRSV,the pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the herodians against him how to destroy him
1415,MRK,3,NRSV,jesus departed with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him
1416,MRK,3,NRSV,hearing all that he was doing they came to him in great numbers from judea jerusalem idumea beyond the jordan and the region around tyre and sidon
1417,MRK,3,NRSV,he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd so that they would not crush him
1418,MRK,3,NRSV,for he had cured many so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him
1419,MRK,3,NRSV,whenever the unclean spirits saw him they fell down before him and shouted you are the son of god
1420,MRK,3,NRSV,but he sternly ordered them not to make him known
1421,MRK,3,NRSV,he went up the mountain and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him
1422,MRK,3,NRSV,and he appointed twelve whom he also named apostles
1423,MRK,3,NRSV,to be with him and to be sent out to proclaim the message
1424,MRK,3,NRSV,and to have authority to cast out demons
1425,MRK,3,NRSV,so he appointed the twelve
1426,MRK,3,NRSV,simon to whom he gave the name peter
1427,MRK,3,NRSV,james son of zebedee and john the brother of james to whom he gave the name boanerges that is sons of thunder
1428,MRK,3,NRSV,and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the cananaean
1429,MRK,3,NRSV,and judas iscariot who betrayed him
1430,MRK,3,NRSV,then he went home
1431,MRK,3,NRSV,and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat
1432,MRK,3,NRSV,when his family heard it they went out to restrain him for people were saying he has gone out of his mind
1433,MRK,3,NRSV,and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons
1434,MRK,3,NRSV,and he called them to him and spoke to them in parables how can satan cast out satan
1435,MRK,3,NRSV,if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
1436,MRK,3,NRSV,and if a house is divided against itself that house will not be able to stand
1437,MRK,3,NRSV,and if satan has risen up against himself and is divided he cannot stand but his end has come
1438,MRK,3,NRSV,but no one can enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man then indeed the house can be plundered
1439,MRK,3,NRSV,truly i tell you people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter
1440,MRK,3,NRSV,but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit can never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin
1441,MRK,3,NRSV,for they had said he has an unclean spirit
1442,MRK,3,NRSV,then his mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent to him and called him
1443,MRK,3,NRSV,a crowd was sitting around him and they said to him your mother and your brothers and sisters
1444,MRK,3,NRSV,are outside asking for you
1445,MRK,3,NRSV,and he replied who are my mother and my brothers
1446,MRK,3,NRSV,and looking at those who sat around him he said here are my mother and my brothers
1447,MRK,3,NRSV,whoever does the will of god is my brother and sister and mother
1448,MRK,4,NRSV,again he began to teach beside the sea such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land
1449,MRK,4,NRSV,he began to teach them many things in parables and in his teaching he said to them
1450,MRK,4,NRSV,listen a sower went out to sow
1451,MRK,4,NRSV,and as he sowed some seed fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up
1452,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and it sprang up quickly since it had no depth of soil
1453,MRK,4,NRSV,and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away
1454,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain
1455,MRK,4,NRSV,other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold
1456,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said let anyone with ears to hear listen
1457,MRK,4,NRSV,when he was alone those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables
1458,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them to you has been given the secret
1459,MRK,4,NRSV,of the kingdom of god but for those outside everything comes in parables
1460,MRK,4,NRSV,in order that
1461,MRK,4,NRSV,they may indeed look but not perceive
1462,MRK,4,NRSV,and may indeed listen but not understand
1463,MRK,4,NRSV,so that they may not turn again and be forgiven
1464,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them do you not understand this parable then how will you understand all the parables
1465,MRK,4,NRSV,the sower sows the word
1466,MRK,4,NRSV,these are the ones on the path where the word is sown when they hear satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them
1467,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on rocky ground when they hear the word they immediately receive it with joy
1468,MRK,4,NRSV,but they have no root and endure only for a while then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word immediately they fall away
1469,MRK,4,NRSV,and others are those sown among the thorns these are the ones who hear the word
1470,MRK,4,NRSV,but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word and it yields nothing
1471,MRK,4,NRSV,and these are the ones sown on the good soil they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold
1472,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket or under the bed and not on the lampstand
1473,MRK,4,NRSV,for there is nothing hidden except to be disclosed nor is anything secret except to come to light
1474,MRK,4,NRSV,let anyone with ears to hear listen
1475,MRK,4,NRSV,and he said to them pay attention to what you hear the measure you give will be the measure you get and still more will be given you
1476,MRK,4,NRSV,for to those who have more will be given and from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
1477,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground
1478,MRK,4,NRSV,and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how
1479,MRK,4,NRSV,the earth produces of itself first the stalk then the head then the full grain in the head
1480,MRK,4,NRSV,but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come
1481,MRK,4,NRSV,he also said with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it
1482,MRK,4,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth
1483,MRK,4,NRSV,yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade
1484,MRK,4,NRSV,with many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it
1485,MRK,4,NRSV,he did not speak to them except in parables but he explained everything in private to his disciples
1486,MRK,4,NRSV,on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go across to the other side
1487,MRK,4,NRSV,and leaving the crowd behind they took him with them in the boat just as he was other boats were with him
1488,MRK,4,NRSV,a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was already being swamped
1489,MRK,4,NRSV,but he was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are perishing
1490,MRK,4,NRSV,he woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be still then the wind ceased and there was a dead calm
1491,MRK,4,NRSV,he said to them why are you afraid have you still no faith
1492,MRK,4,NRSV,and they were filled with great awe and said to one another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
1493,MRK,5,NRSV,they came to the other side of the sea to the country of the gerasenes
1494,MRK,5,NRSV,and when he had stepped out of the boat immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him
1495,MRK,5,NRSV,he lived among the tombs and no one could restrain him any more even with a chain
1496,MRK,5,NRSV,for he had often been restrained with shackles and chains but the chains he wrenched apart and the shackles he broke in pieces and no one had the strength to subdue him
1497,MRK,5,NRSV,night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always howling and bruising himself with stones
1498,MRK,5,NRSV,when he saw jesus from a distance he ran and bowed down before him
1499,MRK,5,NRSV,and he shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god i adjure you by god do not torment me
1500,MRK,5,NRSV,for he had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit
1501,MRK,5,NRSV,then jesus
1502,MRK,5,NRSV,asked him what is your name he replied my name is legion for we are many
1503,MRK,5,NRSV,he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country
1504,MRK,5,NRSV,now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding
1505,MRK,5,NRSV,and the unclean spirits
1506,MRK,5,NRSV,begged him send us into the swine let us enter them
1507,MRK,5,NRSV,so he gave them permission and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine and the herd numbering about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea
1508,MRK,5,NRSV,the swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country then people came to see what it was that had happened
1509,MRK,5,NRSV,they came to jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind the very man who had had the legion and they were afraid
1510,MRK,5,NRSV,those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it
1511,MRK,5,NRSV,then they began to beg jesus
1512,MRK,5,NRSV,to leave their neighborhood
1513,MRK,5,NRSV,as he was getting into the boat the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him
1514,MRK,5,NRSV,but jesus
1515,MRK,5,NRSV,refused and said to him go home to your friends and tell them how much the lord has done for you and what mercy he has shown you
1516,MRK,5,NRSV,and he went away and began to proclaim in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed
1517,MRK,5,NRSV,when jesus had crossed again in the boat
1518,MRK,5,NRSV,to the other side a great crowd gathered around him and he was by the sea
1519,MRK,5,NRSV,then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet
1520,MRK,5,NRSV,and begged him repeatedly my little daughter is at the point of death come and lay your hands on her so that she may be made well and live
1521,MRK,5,NRSV,so he went with him
1522,MRK,5,NRSV,and a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him
1523,MRK,5,NRSV,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years
1524,MRK,5,NRSV,she had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better but rather grew worse
1525,MRK,5,NRSV,she had heard about jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak
1526,MRK,5,NRSV,for she said if i but touch his clothes i will be made well
1527,MRK,5,NRSV,immediately her hemorrhage stopped and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease
1528,MRK,5,NRSV,immediately aware that power had gone forth from him jesus turned about in the crowd and said who touched my clothes
1529,MRK,5,NRSV,and his disciples said to him you see the crowd pressing in on you how can you say who touched me
1530,MRK,5,NRSV,he looked all around to see who had done it
1531,MRK,5,NRSV,but the woman knowing what had happened to her came in fear and trembling fell down before him and told him the whole truth
1532,MRK,5,NRSV,he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be healed of your disease
1533,MRK,5,NRSV,while he was still speaking some people came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead why trouble the teacher any further
1534,MRK,5,NRSV,but overhearing
1535,MRK,5,NRSV,what they said jesus said to the leader of the synagogue do not fear only believe
1536,MRK,5,NRSV,he allowed no one to follow him except peter james and john the brother of james
1537,MRK,5,NRSV,when they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue he saw a commotion people weeping and wailing loudly
1538,MRK,5,NRSV,when he had entered he said to them why do you make a commotion and weep the child is not dead but sleeping
1539,MRK,5,NRSV,and they laughed at him then he put them all outside and took the childs father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was
1540,MRK,5,NRSV,he took her by the hand and said to her talitha cum which means little girl get up
1541,MRK,5,NRSV,and immediately the girl got up and began to walk about she was twelve years of age at this they were overcome with amazement
1542,MRK,5,NRSV,he strictly ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat
1543,MRK,6,NRSV,he left that place and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him
1544,MRK,6,NRSV,on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astounded they said where did this man get all this what is this wisdom that has been given to him what deeds of power are being done by his hands
1545,MRK,6,NRSV,is not this the carpenter the son of mary
1546,MRK,6,NRSV,and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they took offense
1547,MRK,6,NRSV,at him
1548,MRK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them prophets are not without honor except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house
1549,MRK,6,NRSV,and he could do no deed of power there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them
1550,MRK,6,NRSV,and he was amazed at their unbelief
1551,MRK,6,NRSV,then he went about among the villages teaching
1552,MRK,6,NRSV,he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits
1553,MRK,6,NRSV,he ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in their belts
1554,MRK,6,NRSV,but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics
1555,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them wherever you enter a house stay there until you leave the place
1556,MRK,6,NRSV,if any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you as you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them
1557,MRK,6,NRSV,so they went out and proclaimed that all should repent
1558,MRK,6,NRSV,they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them
1559,MRK,6,NRSV,king herod heard of it for jesus
1560,MRK,6,NRSV,name had become known some were
1561,MRK,6,NRSV,saying john the baptizer has been raised from the dead and for this reason these powers are at work in him
1562,MRK,6,NRSV,but others said it is elijah and others said it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old
1563,MRK,6,NRSV,but when herod heard of it he said john whom i beheaded has been raised
1564,MRK,6,NRSV,for herod himself had sent men who arrested john bound him and put him in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because herod
1565,MRK,6,NRSV,had married her
1566,MRK,6,NRSV,for john had been telling herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
1567,MRK,6,NRSV,and herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him but she could not
1568,MRK,6,NRSV,for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and he protected him when he heard him he was greatly perplexed
1569,MRK,6,NRSV,and yet he liked to listen to him
1570,MRK,6,NRSV,but an opportunity came when herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of galilee
1571,MRK,6,NRSV,when his daughter herodias
1572,MRK,6,NRSV,came in and danced she pleased herod and his guests and the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you wish and i will give it
1573,MRK,6,NRSV,and he solemnly swore to her whatever you ask me i will give you even half of my kingdom
1574,MRK,6,NRSV,she went out and said to her mother what should i ask for she replied the head of john the baptizer
1575,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately she rushed back to the king and requested i want you to give me at once the head of john the baptist on a platter
1576,MRK,6,NRSV,the king was deeply grieved yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests he did not want to refuse her
1577,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring johns
1578,MRK,6,NRSV,head he went and beheaded him in the prison
1579,MRK,6,NRSV,brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl then the girl gave it to her mother
1580,MRK,6,NRSV,when his disciples heard about it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb
1581,MRK,6,NRSV,the apostles gathered around jesus and told him all that they had done and taught
1582,MRK,6,NRSV,he said to them come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while for many were coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat
1583,MRK,6,NRSV,and they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves
1584,MRK,6,NRSV,now many saw them going and recognized them and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them
1585,MRK,6,NRSV,as he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd and he began to teach them many things
1586,MRK,6,NRSV,when it grew late his disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is now very late
1587,MRK,6,NRSV,send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy something for themselves to eat
1588,MRK,6,NRSV,but he answered them you give them something to eat they said to him are we to go and buy two hundred denarii
1589,MRK,6,NRSV,worth of bread and give it to them to eat
1590,MRK,6,NRSV,and he said to them how many loaves have you go and see when they had found out they said five and two fish
1591,MRK,6,NRSV,then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass
1592,MRK,6,NRSV,so they sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties
1593,MRK,6,NRSV,taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and he divided the two fish among them all
1594,MRK,6,NRSV,and all ate and were filled
1595,MRK,6,NRSV,and they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish
1596,MRK,6,NRSV,those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men
1597,MRK,6,NRSV,immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd
1598,MRK,6,NRSV,after saying farewell to them he went up on the mountain to pray
1599,MRK,6,NRSV,when evening came the boat was out on the sea and he was alone on the land
1600,MRK,6,NRSV,when he saw that they were straining at the oars against an adverse wind he came towards them early in the morning walking on the sea he intended to pass them by
1601,MRK,6,NRSV,but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost and cried out
1602,MRK,6,NRSV,for they all saw him and were terrified but immediately he spoke to them and said take heart it is i do not be afraid
1603,MRK,6,NRSV,then he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased and they were utterly astounded
1604,MRK,6,NRSV,for they did not understand about the loaves but their hearts were hardened
1605,MRK,6,NRSV,when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret and moored the boat
1606,MRK,6,NRSV,when they got out of the boat people at once recognized him
1607,MRK,6,NRSV,and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was
1608,MRK,6,NRSV,and wherever he went into villages or cities or farms they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak and all who touched it were healed
1609,MRK,7,NRSV,now when the pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from jerusalem gathered around him
1610,MRK,7,NRSV,they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands that is without washing them
1611,MRK,7,NRSV,for the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands
1612,MRK,7,NRSV,thus observing the tradition of the elders
1613,MRK,7,NRSV,and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it
1614,MRK,7,NRSV,and there are also many other traditions that they observe the washing of cups pots and bronze kettles
1615,MRK,7,NRSV,
1616,MRK,7,NRSV,so the pharisees and the scribes asked him why do your disciples not live
1617,MRK,7,NRSV,according to the tradition of the elders but eat with defiled hands
1618,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to them isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites as it is written
1619,MRK,7,NRSV,this people honors me with their lips
1620,MRK,7,NRSV,but their hearts are far from me
1621,MRK,7,NRSV,in vain do they worship me
1622,MRK,7,NRSV,teaching human precepts as doctrines
1623,MRK,7,NRSV,you abandon the commandment of god and hold to human tradition
1624,MRK,7,NRSV,then he said to them you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition
1625,MRK,7,NRSV,for moses said honor your father and your mother and whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die
1626,MRK,7,NRSV,but you say that if anyone tells father or mother whatever support you might have had from me is corban that is an offering to god
1627,MRK,7,NRSV,
1628,MRK,7,NRSV,then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother
1629,MRK,7,NRSV,thus making void the word of god through your tradition that you have handed on and you do many things like this
1630,MRK,7,NRSV,then he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand
1631,MRK,7,NRSV,there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile
1632,MRK,7,NRSV,when he had left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about the parable
1633,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to them then do you also fail to understand do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile
1634,MRK,7,NRSV,since it enters not the heart but the stomach and goes out into the sewer thus he declared all foods clean
1635,MRK,7,NRSV,and he said it is what comes out of a person that defiles
1636,MRK,7,NRSV,for it is from within from the human heart that evil intentions come fornication theft murder
1637,MRK,7,NRSV,adultery avarice wickedness deceit licentiousness envy slander pride folly
1638,MRK,7,NRSV,all these evil things come from within and they defile a person
1639,MRK,7,NRSV,from there he set out and went away to the region of tyre
1640,MRK,7,NRSV,he entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there yet he could not escape notice
1641,MRK,7,NRSV,but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and she came and bowed down at his feet
1642,MRK,7,NRSV,now the woman was a gentile of syrophoenician origin she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter
1643,MRK,7,NRSV,he said to her let the children be fed first for it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
1644,MRK,7,NRSV,but she answered him sir
1645,MRK,7,NRSV,even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs
1646,MRK,7,NRSV,then he said to her for saying that you may gothe demon has left your daughter
1647,MRK,7,NRSV,so she went home found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone
1648,MRK,7,NRSV,then he returned from the region of tyre and went by way of sidon towards the sea of galilee in the region of the decapolis
1649,MRK,7,NRSV,they brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech and they begged him to lay his hand on him
1650,MRK,7,NRSV,he took him aside in private away from the crowd and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue
1651,MRK,7,NRSV,then looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him ephphatha that is be opened
1652,MRK,7,NRSV,and immediately his ears were opened his tongue was released and he spoke plainly
1653,MRK,7,NRSV,then jesus
1654,MRK,7,NRSV,ordered them to tell no one but the more he ordered them the more zealously they proclaimed it
1655,MRK,7,NRSV,they were astounded beyond measure saying he has done everything well he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak
1656,MRK,8,NRSV,in those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat he called his disciples and said to them
1657,MRK,8,NRSV,i have compassion for the crowd because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat
1658,MRK,8,NRSV,if i send them away hungry to their homes they will faint on the wayand some of them have come from a great distance
1659,MRK,8,NRSV,his disciples replied how can one feed these people with bread here in the desert
1660,MRK,8,NRSV,he asked them how many loaves do you have they said seven
1661,MRK,8,NRSV,then he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute and they distributed them to the crowd
1662,MRK,8,NRSV,they had also a few small fish and after blessing them he ordered that these too should be distributed
1663,MRK,8,NRSV,they ate and were filled and they took up the broken pieces left over seven baskets full
1664,MRK,8,NRSV,now there were about four thousand people and he sent them away
1665,MRK,8,NRSV,and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of dalmanutha
1666,MRK,8,NRSV,the pharisees came and began to argue with him asking him for a sign from heaven to test him
1667,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sighed deeply in his spirit and said why does this generation ask for a sign truly i tell you no sign will be given to this generation
1668,MRK,8,NRSV,and he left them and getting into the boat again he went across to the other side
1669,MRK,8,NRSV,now the disciples
1670,MRK,8,NRSV,had forgotten to bring any bread and they had only one loaf with them in the boat
1671,MRK,8,NRSV,and he cautioned them saying watch outbeware of the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod
1672,MRK,8,NRSV,they said to one another it is because we have no bread
1673,MRK,8,NRSV,and becoming aware of it jesus said to them why are you talking about having no bread do you still not perceive or understand are your hearts hardened
1674,MRK,8,NRSV,do you have eyes and fail to see do you have ears and fail to hear and do you not remember
1675,MRK,8,NRSV,when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect they said to him twelve
1676,MRK,8,NRSV,and the seven for the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect and they said to him seven
1677,MRK,8,NRSV,then he said to them do you not yet understand
1678,MRK,8,NRSV,they came to bethsaida some people
1679,MRK,8,NRSV,brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him
1680,MRK,8,NRSV,he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him can you see anything
1681,MRK,8,NRSV,and the man
1682,MRK,8,NRSV,looked up and said i can see people but they look like trees walking
1683,MRK,8,NRSV,then jesus
1684,MRK,8,NRSV,laid his hands on his eyes again and he looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly
1685,MRK,8,NRSV,then he sent him away to his home saying do not even go into the village
1686,MRK,8,NRSV,jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of caesarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples who do people say that i am
1687,MRK,8,NRSV,and they answered him john the baptist and others elijah and still others one of the prophets
1688,MRK,8,NRSV,he asked them but who do you say that i am peter answered him you are the messiah
1689,MRK,8,NRSV,and he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him
1690,MRK,8,NRSV,then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
1691,MRK,8,NRSV,he said all this quite openly and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him
1692,MRK,8,NRSV,but turning and looking at his disciples he rebuked peter and said get behind me satan for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things
1693,MRK,8,NRSV,he called the crowd with his disciples and said to them if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me
1694,MRK,8,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel
1695,MRK,8,NRSV,will save it
1696,MRK,8,NRSV,for what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life
1697,MRK,8,NRSV,indeed what can they give in return for their life
1698,MRK,8,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words
1699,MRK,8,NRSV,in this adulterous and sinful generation of them the son of man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
1700,MRK,9,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of god has come with
1701,MRK,9,NRSV,power
1702,MRK,9,NRSV,six days later jesus took with him peter and james and john and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them
1703,MRK,9,NRSV,and his clothes became dazzling white such as no one
1704,MRK,9,NRSV,on earth could bleach them
1705,MRK,9,NRSV,and there appeared to them elijah with moses who were talking with jesus
1706,MRK,9,NRSV,then peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings
1707,MRK,9,NRSV,one for you one for moses and one for elijah
1708,MRK,9,NRSV,he did not know what to say for they were terrified
1709,MRK,9,NRSV,then a cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud there came a voice this is my son the beloved
1710,MRK,9,NRSV,listen to him
1711,MRK,9,NRSV,suddenly when they looked around they saw no one with them any more but only jesus
1712,MRK,9,NRSV,as they were coming down the mountain he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen until after the son of man had risen from the dead
1713,MRK,9,NRSV,so they kept the matter to themselves questioning what this rising from the dead could mean
1714,MRK,9,NRSV,then they asked him why do the scribes say that elijah must come first
1715,MRK,9,NRSV,he said to them elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things how then is it written about the son of man that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt
1716,MRK,9,NRSV,but i tell you that elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased as it is written about him
1717,MRK,9,NRSV,when they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them
1718,MRK,9,NRSV,when the whole crowd saw him they were immediately overcome with awe and they ran forward to greet him
1719,MRK,9,NRSV,he asked them what are you arguing about with them
1720,MRK,9,NRSV,someone from the crowd answered him teacher i brought you my son he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak
1721,MRK,9,NRSV,and whenever it seizes him it dashes him down and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid and i asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do so
1722,MRK,9,NRSV,he answered them you faithless generation how much longer must i be among you how much longer must i put up with you bring him to me
1723,MRK,9,NRSV,and they brought the boy
1724,MRK,9,NRSV,to him when the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy
1725,MRK,9,NRSV,and he fell on the ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth
1726,MRK,9,NRSV,jesus
1727,MRK,9,NRSV,asked the father how long has this been happening to him and he said from childhood
1728,MRK,9,NRSV,it has often cast him into the fire and into the water to destroy him but if you are able to do anything have pity on us and help us
1729,MRK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him if you are ableall things can be done for the one who believes
1730,MRK,9,NRSV,immediately the father of the child cried out
1731,MRK,9,NRSV,i believe help my unbelief
1732,MRK,9,NRSV,when jesus saw that a crowd came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it you spirit that keeps this boy from speaking and hearing i command you come out of him and never enter him again
1733,MRK,9,NRSV,after crying out and convulsing him terribly it came out and the boy was like a corpse so that most of them said he is dead
1734,MRK,9,NRSV,but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he was able to stand
1735,MRK,9,NRSV,when he had entered the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast it out
1736,MRK,9,NRSV,he said to them this kind can come out only through prayer
1737,MRK,9,NRSV,they went on from there and passed through galilee he did not want anyone to know it
1738,MRK,9,NRSV,for he was teaching his disciples saying to them the son of man is to be betrayed into human hands and they will kill him and three days after being killed he will rise again
1739,MRK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him
1740,MRK,9,NRSV,then they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them what were you arguing about on the way
1741,MRK,9,NRSV,but they were silent for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest
1742,MRK,9,NRSV,he sat down called the twelve and said to them whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all
1743,MRK,9,NRSV,then he took a little child and put it among them and taking it in his arms he said to them
1744,MRK,9,NRSV,whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me
1745,MRK,9,NRSV,john said to him teacher we saw someone
1746,MRK,9,NRSV,casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he was not following us
1747,MRK,9,NRSV,but jesus said do not stop him for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me
1748,MRK,9,NRSV,whoever is not against us is for us
1749,MRK,9,NRSV,for truly i tell you whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of christ will by no means lose the reward
1750,MRK,9,NRSV,if any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me
1751,MRK,9,NRSV,it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea
1752,MRK,9,NRSV,if your hand causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell
1753,MRK,9,NRSV,to the unquenchable fire
1754,MRK,9,NRSV,and if your foot causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell
1755,MRK,9,NRSV,and if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell
1756,MRK,9,NRSV,where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched
1757,MRK,9,NRSV,for everyone will be salted with fire
1758,MRK,9,NRSV,salt is good but if salt has lost its saltiness how can you season it
1759,MRK,9,NRSV,have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another
1760,MRK,10,NRSV,he left that place and went to the region of judea and
1761,MRK,10,NRSV,beyond the jordan and crowds again gathered around him and as was his custom he again taught them
1762,MRK,10,NRSV,some pharisees came and to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife
1763,MRK,10,NRSV,he answered them what did moses command you
1764,MRK,10,NRSV,they said moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her
1765,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you
1766,MRK,10,NRSV,but from the beginning of creation god made them male and female
1767,MRK,10,NRSV,for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
1768,MRK,10,NRSV,and the two shall become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh
1769,MRK,10,NRSV,therefore what god has joined together let no one separate
1770,MRK,10,NRSV,then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter
1771,MRK,10,NRSV,he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her
1772,MRK,10,NRSV,and if she divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery
1773,MRK,10,NRSV,people were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them and the disciples spoke sternly to them
1774,MRK,10,NRSV,but when jesus saw this he was indignant and said to them let the little children come to me do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs
1775,MRK,10,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it
1776,MRK,10,NRSV,and he took them up in his arms laid his hands on them and blessed them
1777,MRK,10,NRSV,as he was setting out on a journey a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
1778,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good no one is good but god alone
1779,MRK,10,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness you shall not defraud honor your father and mother
1780,MRK,10,NRSV,he said to him teacher i have kept all these since my youth
1781,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus looking at him loved him and said you lack one thing go sell what you own and give the money
1782,MRK,10,NRSV,to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
1783,MRK,10,NRSV,when he heard this he was shocked and went away grieving for he had many possessions
1784,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god
1785,MRK,10,NRSV,and the disciples were perplexed at these words but jesus said to them again children how hard it is
1786,MRK,10,NRSV,to enter the kingdom of god
1787,MRK,10,NRSV,it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
1788,MRK,10,NRSV,they were greatly astounded and said to one another
1789,MRK,10,NRSV,then who can be saved
1790,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus looked at them and said for mortals it is impossible but not for god for god all things are possible
1791,MRK,10,NRSV,peter began to say to him look we have left everything and followed you
1792,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news
1793,MRK,10,NRSV,who will not receive a hundredfold now in this agehouses brothers and sisters mothers and children and fields with persecutionsand in the age to come eternal life
1794,MRK,10,NRSV,but many who are first will be last and the last will be first
1795,MRK,10,NRSV,they were on the road going up to jerusalem and jesus was walking ahead of them they were amazed and those who followed were afraid he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him
1796,MRK,10,NRSV,saying see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn him to death then they will hand him over to the gentiles
1797,MRK,10,NRSV,they will mock him and spit upon him and flog him and kill him and after three days he will rise again
1798,MRK,10,NRSV,james and john the sons of zebedee came forward to him and said to him teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you
1799,MRK,10,NRSV,and he said to them what is it you want me to do for you
1800,MRK,10,NRSV,and they said to him grant us to sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
1801,MRK,10,NRSV,but jesus said to them you do not know what you are asking are you able to drink the cup that i drink or be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
1802,MRK,10,NRSV,they replied we are able then jesus said to them the cup that i drink you will drink and with the baptism with which i am baptized you will be baptized
1803,MRK,10,NRSV,but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant but it is for those for whom it has been prepared
1804,MRK,10,NRSV,when the ten heard this they began to be angry with james and john
1805,MRK,10,NRSV,so jesus called them and said to them you know that among the gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them
1806,MRK,10,NRSV,but it is not so among you but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
1807,MRK,10,NRSV,and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all
1808,MRK,10,NRSV,for the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
1809,MRK,10,NRSV,they came to jericho as he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving jericho bartimaeus son of timaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside
1810,MRK,10,NRSV,when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to shout out and say jesus son of david have mercy on me
1811,MRK,10,NRSV,many sternly ordered him to be quiet but he cried out even more loudly son of david have mercy on me
1812,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus stood still and said call him here and they called the blind man saying to him take heart get up he is calling you
1813,MRK,10,NRSV,so throwing off his cloak he sprang up and came to jesus
1814,MRK,10,NRSV,then jesus said to him what do you want me to do for you the blind man said to him my teacher
1815,MRK,10,NRSV,let me see again
1816,MRK,10,NRSV,jesus said to him go your faith has made you well immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way
1817,MRK,11,NRSV,when they were approaching jerusalem at bethphage and bethany near the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples
1818,MRK,11,NRSV,and said to them go into the village ahead of you and immediately as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it
1819,MRK,11,NRSV,if anyone says to you why are you doing this just say this the lord needs it and will send it back here immediately
1820,MRK,11,NRSV,they went away and found a colt tied near a door outside in the street as they were untying it
1821,MRK,11,NRSV,some of the bystanders said to them what are you doing untying the colt
1822,MRK,11,NRSV,they told them what jesus had said and they allowed them to take it
1823,MRK,11,NRSV,then they brought the colt to jesus and threw their cloaks on it and he sat on it
1824,MRK,11,NRSV,many people spread their cloaks on the road and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields
1825,MRK,11,NRSV,then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting
1826,MRK,11,NRSV,hosanna
1827,MRK,11,NRSV,blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
1828,MRK,11,NRSV,blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor david
1829,MRK,11,NRSV,hosanna in the highest heaven
1830,MRK,11,NRSV,then he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve
1831,MRK,11,NRSV,on the following day when they came from bethany he was hungry
1832,MRK,11,NRSV,seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf he went to see whether perhaps he would find anything on it when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
1833,MRK,11,NRSV,he said to it may no one ever eat fruit from you again and his disciples heard it
1834,MRK,11,NRSV,then they came to jerusalem and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves
1835,MRK,11,NRSV,and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple
1836,MRK,11,NRSV,he was teaching and saying is it not written
1837,MRK,11,NRSV,my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations
1838,MRK,11,NRSV,but you have made it a den of robbers
1839,MRK,11,NRSV,and when the chief priests and the scribes heard it they kept looking for a way to kill him for they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching
1840,MRK,11,NRSV,and when evening came jesus and his disciples
1841,MRK,11,NRSV,went out of the city
1842,MRK,11,NRSV,in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots
1843,MRK,11,NRSV,then peter remembered and said to him rabbi look the fig tree that you cursed has withered
1844,MRK,11,NRSV,jesus answered them have
1845,MRK,11,NRSV,faith in god
1846,MRK,11,NRSV,truly i tell you if you say to this mountain be taken up and thrown into the sea and if you do not doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass it will be done for you
1847,MRK,11,NRSV,so i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received
1848,MRK,11,NRSV,it and it will be yours
1849,MRK,11,NRSV,whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses
1850,MRK,11,NRSV,again they came to jerusalem as he was walking in the temple the chief priests the scribes and the elders came to him
1851,MRK,11,NRSV,and said by what authority are you doing these things who gave you this authority to do them
1852,MRK,11,NRSV,jesus said to them i will ask you one question answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
1853,MRK,11,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin answer me
1854,MRK,11,NRSV,they argued with one another if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not believe him
1855,MRK,11,NRSV,but shall we say of human originthey were afraid of the crowd for all regarded john as truly a prophet
1856,MRK,11,NRSV,so they answered jesus we do not know and jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things
1857,MRK,12,NRSV,then he began to speak to them in parables a man planted a vineyard put a fence around it dug a pit for the wine press and built a watchtower then he leased it to tenants and went to another country
1858,MRK,12,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard
1859,MRK,12,NRSV,but they seized him and beat him and sent him away emptyhanded
1860,MRK,12,NRSV,and again he sent another slave to them this one they beat over the head and insulted
1861,MRK,12,NRSV,then he sent another and that one they killed and so it was with many others some they beat and others they killed
1862,MRK,12,NRSV,he had still one other a beloved son finally he sent him to them saying they will respect my son
1863,MRK,12,NRSV,but those tenants said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours
1864,MRK,12,NRSV,so they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard
1865,MRK,12,NRSV,what then will the owner of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others
1866,MRK,12,NRSV,have you not read this scripture
1867,MRK,12,NRSV,the stone that the builders rejected
1868,MRK,12,NRSV,has become the cornerstone
1869,MRK,12,NRSV,this was the lords doing
1870,MRK,12,NRSV,and it is amazing in our eyes
1871,MRK,12,NRSV,when they realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to arrest him but they feared the crowd so they left him and went away
1872,MRK,12,NRSV,then they sent to him some pharisees and some herodians to trap him in what he said
1873,MRK,12,NRSV,and they came and said to him teacher we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one for you do not regard people with partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with truth is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not
1874,MRK,12,NRSV,should we pay them or should we not but knowing their hypocrisy he said to them why are you putting me to the test bring me a denarius and let me see it
1875,MRK,12,NRSV,and they brought one then he said to them whose head is this and whose title they answered the emperors
1876,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods and they were utterly amazed at him
1877,MRK,12,NRSV,some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him and asked him a question saying
1878,MRK,12,NRSV,teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no child the man
1879,MRK,12,NRSV,shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
1880,MRK,12,NRSV,there were seven brothers the first married and when he died left no children
1881,MRK,12,NRSV,and the second married her and died leaving no children and the third likewise
1882,MRK,12,NRSV,none of the seven left children last of all the woman herself died
1883,MRK,12,NRSV,in the resurrection
1884,MRK,12,NRSV,whose wife will she be for the seven had married her
1885,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus said to them is not this the reason you are wrong that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god
1886,MRK,12,NRSV,for when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven
1887,MRK,12,NRSV,and as for the dead being raised have you not read in the book of moses in the story about the bush how god said to him i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
1888,MRK,12,NRSV,he is god not of the dead but of the living you are quite wrong
1889,MRK,12,NRSV,one of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well he asked him which commandment is the first of all
1890,MRK,12,NRSV,jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one
1891,MRK,12,NRSV,you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
1892,MRK,12,NRSV,the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
1893,MRK,12,NRSV,then the scribe said to him you are right teacher you have truly said that he is one and besides him there is no other
1894,MRK,12,NRSV,and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneselfthis is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
1895,MRK,12,NRSV,when jesus saw that he answered wisely he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god after that no one dared to ask him any question
1896,MRK,12,NRSV,while jesus was teaching in the temple he said how can the scribes say that the messiah
1897,MRK,12,NRSV,is the son of david
1898,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself by the holy spirit declared
1899,MRK,12,NRSV,the lord said to my lord
1900,MRK,12,NRSV,sit at my right hand
1901,MRK,12,NRSV,until i put your enemies under your feet
1902,MRK,12,NRSV,david himself calls him lord so how can he be his son and the large crowd was listening to him with delight
1903,MRK,12,NRSV,as he taught he said beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
1904,MRK,12,NRSV,and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets
1905,MRK,12,NRSV,they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers they will receive the greater condemnation
1906,MRK,12,NRSV,he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury many rich people put in large sums
1907,MRK,12,NRSV,a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which are worth a penny
1908,MRK,12,NRSV,then he called his disciples and said to them truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury
1909,MRK,12,NRSV,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had all she had to live on
1910,MRK,13,NRSV,as he came out of the temple one of his disciples said to him look teacher what large stones and what large buildings
1911,MRK,13,NRSV,then jesus asked him do you see these great buildings not one stone will be left here upon another all will be thrown down
1912,MRK,13,NRSV,when he was sitting on the mount of olives opposite the temple peter james john and andrew asked him privately
1913,MRK,13,NRSV,tell us when will this be and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished
1914,MRK,13,NRSV,then jesus began to say to them beware that no one leads you astray
1915,MRK,13,NRSV,many will come in my name and say i am he
1916,MRK,13,NRSV,and they will lead many astray
1917,MRK,13,NRSV,when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed this must take place but the end is still to come
1918,MRK,13,NRSV,for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in various places there will be famines this is but the beginning of the birth pangs
1919,MRK,13,NRSV,as for yourselves beware for they will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them
1920,MRK,13,NRSV,and the good news
1921,MRK,13,NRSV,must first be proclaimed to all nations
1922,MRK,13,NRSV,when they bring you to trial and hand you over do not worry beforehand about what you are to say but say whatever is given you at that time for it is not you who speak but the holy spirit
1923,MRK,13,NRSV,brother will betray brother to death and a father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death
1924,MRK,13,NRSV,and you will be hated by all because of my name but the one who endures to the end will be saved
1925,MRK,13,NRSV,but when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be let the reader understand then those in judea must flee to the mountains
1926,MRK,13,NRSV,the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away
1927,MRK,13,NRSV,the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat
1928,MRK,13,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days
1929,MRK,13,NRSV,pray that it may not be in winter
1930,MRK,13,NRSV,for in those days there will be suffering such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that god created until now no and never will be
1931,MRK,13,NRSV,and if the lord had not cut short those days no one would be saved but for the sake of the elect whom he chose he has cut short those days
1932,MRK,13,NRSV,and if anyone says to you at that time look here is the messiah
1933,MRK,13,NRSV,or look there he isdo not believe it
1934,MRK,13,NRSV,false messiahs
1935,MRK,13,NRSV,and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to lead astray if possible the elect
1936,MRK,13,NRSV,but be alert i have already told you everything
1937,MRK,13,NRSV,but in those days after that suffering
1938,MRK,13,NRSV,the sun will be darkened
1939,MRK,13,NRSV,and the moon will not give its light
1940,MRK,13,NRSV,and the stars will be falling from heaven
1941,MRK,13,NRSV,and the powers in the heavens will be shaken
1942,MRK,13,NRSV,then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
1943,MRK,13,NRSV,then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven
1944,MRK,13,NRSV,from the fig tree learn its lesson as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves you know that summer is near
1945,MRK,13,NRSV,so also when you see these things taking place you know that he
1946,MRK,13,NRSV,is near at the very gates
1947,MRK,13,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place
1948,MRK,13,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
1949,MRK,13,NRSV,but about that day or hour no one knows neither the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father
1950,MRK,13,NRSV,beware keep alert
1951,MRK,13,NRSV,for you do not know when the time will come
1952,MRK,13,NRSV,it is like a man going on a journey when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge each with his work and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch
1953,MRK,13,NRSV,therefore keep awakefor you do not know when the master of the house will come in the evening or at midnight or at cockcrow or at dawn
1954,MRK,13,NRSV,or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly
1955,MRK,13,NRSV,and what i say to you i say to all keep awake
1956,MRK,14,NRSV,it was two days before the passover and the festival of unleavened bread the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest jesus
1957,MRK,14,NRSV,by stealth and kill him
1958,MRK,14,NRSV,for they said not during the festival or there may be a riot among the people
1959,MRK,14,NRSV,while he was at bethany in the house of simon the leper
1960,MRK,14,NRSV,as he sat at the table a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard and she broke open the jar and poured the ointment on his head
1961,MRK,14,NRSV,but some were there who said to one another in anger why was the ointment wasted in this way
1962,MRK,14,NRSV,for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii
1963,MRK,14,NRSV,and the money given to the poor and they scolded her
1964,MRK,14,NRSV,but jesus said let her alone why do you trouble her she has performed a good service for me
1965,MRK,14,NRSV,for you always have the poor with you and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish but you will not always have me
1966,MRK,14,NRSV,she has done what she could she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial
1967,MRK,14,NRSV,truly i tell you wherever the good news
1968,MRK,14,NRSV,is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in remembrance of her
1969,MRK,14,NRSV,then judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them
1970,MRK,14,NRSV,when they heard it they were greatly pleased and promised to give him money so he began to look for an opportunity to betray him
1971,MRK,14,NRSV,on the first day of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is sacrificed his disciples said to him where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the passover
1972,MRK,14,NRSV,so he sent two of his disciples saying to them go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him
1973,MRK,14,NRSV,and wherever he enters say to the owner of the house the teacher asks where is my guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
1974,MRK,14,NRSV,he will show you a large room upstairs furnished and ready make preparations for us there
1975,MRK,14,NRSV,so the disciples set out and went to the city and found everything as he had told them and they prepared the passover meal
1976,MRK,14,NRSV,when it was evening he came with the twelve
1977,MRK,14,NRSV,and when they had taken their places and were eating jesus said truly i tell you one of you will betray me one who is eating with me
1978,MRK,14,NRSV,they began to be distressed and to say to him one after another surely not i
1979,MRK,14,NRSV,he said to them it is one of the twelve one who is dipping bread
1980,MRK,14,NRSV,into the bowl
1981,MRK,14,NRSV,with me
1982,MRK,14,NRSV,for the son of man goes as it is written of him but woe to that one by whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that one not to have been born
1983,MRK,14,NRSV,while they were eating he took a loaf of bread and after blessing it he broke it gave it to them and said take this is my body
1984,MRK,14,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he gave it to them and all of them drank from it
1985,MRK,14,NRSV,he said to them this is my blood of the
1986,MRK,14,NRSV,covenant which is poured out for many
1987,MRK,14,NRSV,truly i tell you i will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god
1988,MRK,14,NRSV,when they had sung the hymn they went out to the mount of olives
1989,MRK,14,NRSV,and jesus said to them you will all become deserters for it is written
1990,MRK,14,NRSV,i will strike the shepherd
1991,MRK,14,NRSV,and the sheep will be scattered
1992,MRK,14,NRSV,but after i am raised up i will go before you to galilee
1993,MRK,14,NRSV,peter said to him even though all become deserters i will not
1994,MRK,14,NRSV,jesus said to him truly i tell you this day this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times
1995,MRK,14,NRSV,but he said vehemently even though i must die with you i will not deny you and all of them said the same
1996,MRK,14,NRSV,they went to a place called gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while i pray
1997,MRK,14,NRSV,he took with him peter and james and john and began to be distressed and agitated
1998,MRK,14,NRSV,and he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death remain here and keep awake
1999,MRK,14,NRSV,and going a little farther he threw himself on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
2000,MRK,14,NRSV,he said abba
2001,MRK,14,NRSV,father for you all things are possible remove this cup from me yet not what i want but what you want
2002,MRK,14,NRSV,he came and found them sleeping and he said to peter simon are you asleep could you not keep awake one hour
2003,MRK,14,NRSV,keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial
2004,MRK,14,NRSV,the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
2005,MRK,14,NRSV,and again he went away and prayed saying the same words
2006,MRK,14,NRSV,and once more he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they did not know what to say to him
2007,MRK,14,NRSV,he came a third time and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest enough the hour has come the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
2008,MRK,14,NRSV,get up let us be going see my betrayer is at hand
2009,MRK,14,NRSV,immediately while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders
2010,MRK,14,NRSV,now the betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i will kiss is the man arrest him and lead him away under guard
2011,MRK,14,NRSV,so when he came he went up to him at once and said rabbi and kissed him
2012,MRK,14,NRSV,then they laid hands on him and arrested him
2013,MRK,14,NRSV,but one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his ear
2014,MRK,14,NRSV,then jesus said to them have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though i were a bandit
2015,MRK,14,NRSV,day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and you did not arrest me but let the scriptures be fulfilled
2016,MRK,14,NRSV,all of them deserted him and fled
2017,MRK,14,NRSV,a certain young man was following him wearing nothing but a linen cloth they caught hold of him
2018,MRK,14,NRSV,but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked
2019,MRK,14,NRSV,they took jesus to the high priest and all the chief priests the elders and the scribes were assembled
2020,MRK,14,NRSV,peter had followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting with the guards warming himself at the fire
2021,MRK,14,NRSV,now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against jesus to put him to death but they found none
2022,MRK,14,NRSV,for many gave false testimony against him and their testimony did not agree
2023,MRK,14,NRSV,some stood up and gave false testimony against him saying
2024,MRK,14,NRSV,we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another not made with hands
2025,MRK,14,NRSV,but even on this point their testimony did not agree
2026,MRK,14,NRSV,then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus have you no answer what is it that they testify against you
2027,MRK,14,NRSV,but he was silent and did not answer again the high priest asked him are you the messiah
2028,MRK,14,NRSV,the son of the blessed one
2029,MRK,14,NRSV,jesus said i am and
2030,MRK,14,NRSV,you will see the son of man
2031,MRK,14,NRSV,seated at the right hand of the power
2032,MRK,14,NRSV,and coming with the clouds of heaven
2033,MRK,14,NRSV,then the high priest tore his clothes and said why do we still need witnesses
2034,MRK,14,NRSV,you have heard his blasphemy what is your decision all of them condemned him as deserving death
2035,MRK,14,NRSV,some began to spit on him to blindfold him and to strike him saying to him prophesy the guards also took him over and beat him
2036,MRK,14,NRSV,while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servantgirls of the high priest came by
2037,MRK,14,NRSV,when she saw peter warming himself she stared at him and said you also were with jesus the man from nazareth
2038,MRK,14,NRSV,but he denied it saying i do not know or understand what you are talking about and he went out into the forecourt
2039,MRK,14,NRSV,then the cock crowed
2040,MRK,14,NRSV,and the servantgirl on seeing him began again to say to the bystanders this man is one of them
2041,MRK,14,NRSV,but again he denied it then after a little while the bystanders again said to peter certainly you are one of them for you are a galilean
2042,MRK,14,NRSV,but he began to curse and he swore an oath i do not know this man you are talking about
2043,MRK,14,NRSV,at that moment the cock crowed for the second time then peter remembered that jesus had said to him before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times and he broke down and wept
2044,MRK,15,NRSV,as soon as it was morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council they bound jesus led him away and handed him over to pilate
2045,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked him are you the king of the jews he answered him you say so
2046,MRK,15,NRSV,then the chief priests accused him of many things
2047,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked him again have you no answer see how many charges they bring against you
2048,MRK,15,NRSV,but jesus made no further reply so that pilate was amazed
2049,MRK,15,NRSV,now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them anyone for whom they asked
2050,MRK,15,NRSV,now a man called barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection
2051,MRK,15,NRSV,so the crowd came and began to ask pilate to do for them according to his custom
2052,MRK,15,NRSV,then he answered them do you want me to release for you the king of the jews
2053,MRK,15,NRSV,for he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over
2054,MRK,15,NRSV,but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabbas for them instead
2055,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate spoke to them again then what do you wish me to do
2056,MRK,15,NRSV,with the man you call
2057,MRK,15,NRSV,the king of the jews
2058,MRK,15,NRSV,they shouted back crucify him
2059,MRK,15,NRSV,pilate asked them why what evil has he done but they shouted all the more crucify him
2060,MRK,15,NRSV,so pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd released barabbas for them and after flogging jesus he handed him over to be crucified
2061,MRK,15,NRSV,then the soldiers led him into the courtyard of the palace that is the governors headquarters
2062,MRK,15,NRSV,and they called together the whole cohort
2063,MRK,15,NRSV,and they clothed him in a purple cloak and after twisting some thorns into a crown they put it on him
2064,MRK,15,NRSV,and they began saluting him hail king of the jews
2065,MRK,15,NRSV,they struck his head with a reed spat upon him and knelt down in homage to him
2066,MRK,15,NRSV,after mocking him they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him then they led him out to crucify him
2067,MRK,15,NRSV,they compelled a passerby who was coming in from the country to carry his cross it was simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus
2068,MRK,15,NRSV,then they brought jesus
2069,MRK,15,NRSV,to the place called golgotha which means the place of a skull
2070,MRK,15,NRSV,and they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it
2071,MRK,15,NRSV,and they crucified him and divided his clothes among them casting lots to decide what each should take
2072,MRK,15,NRSV,it was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him
2073,MRK,15,NRSV,the inscription of the charge against him read the king of the jews
2074,MRK,15,NRSV,and with him they crucified two bandits one on his right and one on his left
2075,MRK,15,NRSV,those who passed by derided
2076,MRK,15,NRSV,him shaking their heads and saying aha you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days
2077,MRK,15,NRSV,save yourself and come down from the cross
2078,MRK,15,NRSV,in the same way the chief priests along with the scribes were also mocking him among themselves and saying he saved others he cannot save himself
2079,MRK,15,NRSV,let the messiah
2080,MRK,15,NRSV,the king of israel come down from the cross now so that we may see and believe those who were crucified with him also taunted him
2081,MRK,15,NRSV,when it was noon darkness came over the whole land
2082,MRK,15,NRSV,until three in the afternoon
2083,MRK,15,NRSV,at three oclock jesus cried out with a loud voice eloi eloi lema sabachthani which means my god my god why have you forsaken me
2084,MRK,15,NRSV,when some of the bystanders heard it they said listen he is calling for elijah
2085,MRK,15,NRSV,and someone ran filled a sponge with sour wine put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink saying wait let us see whether elijah will come to take him down
2086,MRK,15,NRSV,then jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last
2087,MRK,15,NRSV,and the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
2088,MRK,15,NRSV,now when the centurion who stood facing him saw that in this way he
2089,MRK,15,NRSV,breathed his last he said truly this man was gods son
2090,MRK,15,NRSV,there were also women looking on from a distance among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the younger and of joses and salome
2091,MRK,15,NRSV,these used to follow him and provided for him when he was in galilee and there were many other women who had come up with him to jerusalem
2092,MRK,15,NRSV,when evening had come and since it was the day of preparation that is the day before the sabbath
2093,MRK,15,NRSV,joseph of arimathea a respected member of the council who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god went boldly to pilate and asked for the body of jesus
2094,MRK,15,NRSV,then pilate wondered if he were already dead and summoning the centurion he asked him whether he had been dead for some time
2095,MRK,15,NRSV,when he learned from the centurion that he was dead he granted the body to joseph
2096,MRK,15,NRSV,then joseph
2097,MRK,15,NRSV,bought a linen cloth and taking down the body
2098,MRK,15,NRSV,wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock he then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb
2099,MRK,15,NRSV,mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw where the body
2100,MRK,15,NRSV,was laid
2101,MRK,16,NRSV,when the sabbath was over mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him
2102,MRK,16,NRSV,and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they went to the tomb
2103,MRK,16,NRSV,they had been saying to one another who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb
2104,MRK,16,NRSV,when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled back
2105,MRK,16,NRSV,as they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed
2106,MRK,16,NRSV,but he said to them do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified he has been raised he is not here look there is the place they laid him
2107,MRK,16,NRSV,but go tell his disciples and peter that he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him just as he told you
2108,MRK,16,NRSV,so they went out and fled from the tomb for terror and amazement had seized them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid
2109,MRK,16,NRSV,and all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around peter and afterward jesus himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation
2110,MRK,16,NRSV,now after he rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons
2111,MRK,16,NRSV,she went out and told those who had been with him while they were mourning and weeping
2112,MRK,16,NRSV,but when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they would not believe it
2113,MRK,16,NRSV,after this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country
2114,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them
2115,MRK,16,NRSV,later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen
2116,MRK,16,NRSV,and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the good news
2117,MRK,16,NRSV,to the whole creation
2118,MRK,16,NRSV,the one who believes and is baptized will be saved but the one who does not believe will be condemned
2119,MRK,16,NRSV,and these signs will accompany those who believe by using my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new tongues
2120,MRK,16,NRSV,they will pick up snakes in their hands
2121,MRK,16,NRSV,and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover
2122,MRK,16,NRSV,so then the lord jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god
2123,MRK,16,NRSV,and they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere while the lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it
2124,LUK,1,NRSV,since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us
2125,LUK,1,NRSV,just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
2126,LUK,1,NRSV,i too decided after investigating everything carefully from the very first
2127,LUK,1,NRSV,to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus
2128,LUK,1,NRSV,so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed
2129,LUK,1,NRSV,in the days of king herod of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of abijah his wife was a descendant of aaron and her name was elizabeth
2130,LUK,1,NRSV,both of them were righteous before god living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the lord
2131,LUK,1,NRSV,but they had no children because elizabeth was barren and both were getting on in years
2132,LUK,1,NRSV,once when he was serving as priest before god and his section was on duty
2133,LUK,1,NRSV,he was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to enter the sanctuary of the lord and offer incense
2134,LUK,1,NRSV,now at the time of the incense offering the whole assembly of the people was praying outside
2135,LUK,1,NRSV,then there appeared to him an angel of the lord standing at the right side of the altar of incense
2136,LUK,1,NRSV,when zechariah saw him he was terrified and fear overwhelmed him
2137,LUK,1,NRSV,but the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariah for your prayer has been heard your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you will name him john
2138,LUK,1,NRSV,you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth
2139,LUK,1,NRSV,for he will be great in the sight of the lord he must never drink wine or strong drink even before his birth he will be filled with the holy spirit
2140,LUK,1,NRSV,he will turn many of the people of israel to the lord their god
2141,LUK,1,NRSV,with the spirit and power of elijah he will go before him to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the lord
2142,LUK,1,NRSV,zechariah said to the angel how will i know that this is so for i am an old man and my wife is getting on in years
2143,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel replied i am gabriel i stand in the presence of god and i have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news
2144,LUK,1,NRSV,but now because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time you will become mute unable to speak until the day these things occur
2145,LUK,1,NRSV,meanwhile the people were waiting for zechariah and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary
2146,LUK,1,NRSV,when he did come out he could not speak to them and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary he kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak
2147,LUK,1,NRSV,when his time of service was ended he went to his home
2148,LUK,1,NRSV,after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and for five months she remained in seclusion she said
2149,LUK,1,NRSV,this is what the lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace i have endured among my people
2150,LUK,1,NRSV,in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent by god to a town in galilee called nazareth
2151,LUK,1,NRSV,to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david the virgins name was mary
2152,LUK,1,NRSV,and he came to her and said greetings favored one the lord is with you
2153,LUK,1,NRSV,but she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be
2154,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel said to her do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god
2155,LUK,1,NRSV,and now you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will name him jesus
2156,LUK,1,NRSV,he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his ancestor david
2157,LUK,1,NRSV,he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
2158,LUK,1,NRSV,mary said to the angel how can this be since i am a virgin
2159,LUK,1,NRSV,the angel said to her the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born
2160,LUK,1,NRSV,will be holy he will be called son of god
2161,LUK,1,NRSV,and now your relative elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren
2162,LUK,1,NRSV,for nothing will be impossible with god
2163,LUK,1,NRSV,then mary said here am i the servant of the lord let it be with me according to your word then the angel departed from her
2164,LUK,1,NRSV,in those days mary set out and went with haste to a judean town in the hill country
2165,LUK,1,NRSV,where she entered the house of zechariah and greeted elizabeth
2166,LUK,1,NRSV,when elizabeth heard marys greeting the child leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit
2167,LUK,1,NRSV,and exclaimed with a loud cry blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb
2168,LUK,1,NRSV,and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me
2169,LUK,1,NRSV,for as soon as i heard the sound of your greeting the child in my womb leaped for joy
2170,LUK,1,NRSV,and blessed is she who believed that there would be
2171,LUK,1,NRSV,a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the lord
2172,LUK,1,NRSV,and mary
2173,LUK,1,NRSV,said
2174,LUK,1,NRSV,my soul magnifies the lord
2175,LUK,1,NRSV,and my spirit rejoices in god my savior
2176,LUK,1,NRSV,for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant
2177,LUK,1,NRSV,surely from now on all generations will call me blessed
2178,LUK,1,NRSV,for the mighty one has done great things for me
2179,LUK,1,NRSV,and holy is his name
2180,LUK,1,NRSV,his mercy is for those who fear him
2181,LUK,1,NRSV,from generation to generation
2182,LUK,1,NRSV,he has shown strength with his arm
2183,LUK,1,NRSV,he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts
2184,LUK,1,NRSV,he has brought down the powerful from their thrones
2185,LUK,1,NRSV,and lifted up the lowly
2186,LUK,1,NRSV,he has filled the hungry with good things
2187,LUK,1,NRSV,and sent the rich away empty
2188,LUK,1,NRSV,he has helped his servant israel
2189,LUK,1,NRSV,in remembrance of his mercy
2190,LUK,1,NRSV,according to the promise he made to our ancestors
2191,LUK,1,NRSV,to abraham and to his descendants forever
2192,LUK,1,NRSV,and mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home
2193,LUK,1,NRSV,now the time came for elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son
2194,LUK,1,NRSV,her neighbors and relatives heard that the lord had shown his great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her
2195,LUK,1,NRSV,on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him zechariah after his father
2196,LUK,1,NRSV,but his mother said no he is to be called john
2197,LUK,1,NRSV,they said to her none of your relatives has this name
2198,LUK,1,NRSV,then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him
2199,LUK,1,NRSV,he asked for a writing tablet and wrote his name is john and all of them were amazed
2200,LUK,1,NRSV,immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed and he began to speak praising god
2201,LUK,1,NRSV,fear came over all their neighbors and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of judea
2202,LUK,1,NRSV,all who heard them pondered them and said what then will this child become for indeed the hand of the lord was with him
2203,LUK,1,NRSV,then his father zechariah was filled with the holy spirit and spoke this prophecy
2204,LUK,1,NRSV,blessed be the lord god of israel
2205,LUK,1,NRSV,for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them
2206,LUK,1,NRSV,he has raised up a mighty savior
2207,LUK,1,NRSV,for us
2208,LUK,1,NRSV,in the house of his servant david
2209,LUK,1,NRSV,as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old
2210,LUK,1,NRSV,that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us
2211,LUK,1,NRSV,thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors
2212,LUK,1,NRSV,and has remembered his holy covenant
2213,LUK,1,NRSV,the oath that he swore to our ancestor abraham
2214,LUK,1,NRSV,to grant us
2215,LUK,1,NRSV,that we being rescued from the hands of our enemies
2216,LUK,1,NRSV,might serve him without fear
2217,LUK,1,NRSV,in holiness and righteousness
2218,LUK,1,NRSV,before him all our days
2219,LUK,1,NRSV,and you child will be called the prophet of the most high
2220,LUK,1,NRSV,for you will go before the lord to prepare his ways
2221,LUK,1,NRSV,to give knowledge of salvation to his people
2222,LUK,1,NRSV,by the forgiveness of their sins
2223,LUK,1,NRSV,by the tender mercy of our god
2224,LUK,1,NRSV,the dawn from on high will break upon
2225,LUK,1,NRSV,us
2226,LUK,1,NRSV,to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death
2227,LUK,1,NRSV,to guide our feet into the way of peace
2228,LUK,1,NRSV,the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to israel
2229,LUK,2,NRSV,in those days a decree went out from emperor augustus that all the world should be registered
2230,LUK,2,NRSV,this was the first registration and was taken while quirinius was governor of syria
2231,LUK,2,NRSV,all went to their own towns to be registered
2232,LUK,2,NRSV,joseph also went from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to the city of david called bethlehem because he was descended from the house and family of david
2233,LUK,2,NRSV,he went to be registered with mary to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child
2234,LUK,2,NRSV,while they were there the time came for her to deliver her child
2235,LUK,2,NRSV,and she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn
2236,LUK,2,NRSV,in that region there were shepherds living in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night
2237,LUK,2,NRSV,then an angel of the lord stood before them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were terrified
2238,LUK,2,NRSV,but the angel said to them do not be afraid for seei am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people
2239,LUK,2,NRSV,to you is born this day in the city of david a savior who is the messiah
2240,LUK,2,NRSV,the lord
2241,LUK,2,NRSV,this will be a sign for you you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger
2242,LUK,2,NRSV,and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
2243,LUK,2,NRSV,praising god and saying
2244,LUK,2,NRSV,glory to god in the highest heaven
2245,LUK,2,NRSV,and on earth peace among those whom he favors
2246,LUK,2,NRSV,when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another let us go now to bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place which the lord has made known to us
2247,LUK,2,NRSV,so they went with haste and found mary and joseph and the child lying in the manger
2248,LUK,2,NRSV,when they saw this they made known what had been told them about this child
2249,LUK,2,NRSV,and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them
2250,LUK,2,NRSV,but mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart
2251,LUK,2,NRSV,the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all they had heard and seen as it had been told them
2252,LUK,2,NRSV,after eight days had passed it was time to circumcise the child and he was called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb
2253,LUK,2,NRSV,when the time came for their purification according to the law of moses they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to the lord
2254,LUK,2,NRSV,as it is written in the law of the lord every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the lord
2255,LUK,2,NRSV,and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
2256,LUK,2,NRSV,now there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon
2257,LUK,2,NRSV,this man was righteous and devout looking forward to the consolation of israel and the holy spirit rested on him
2258,LUK,2,NRSV,it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the lords messiah
2259,LUK,2,NRSV,guided by the spirit simeon
2260,LUK,2,NRSV,came into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what was customary under the law
2261,LUK,2,NRSV,simeon
2262,LUK,2,NRSV,took him in his arms and praised god saying
2263,LUK,2,NRSV,master now you are dismissing your servant
2264,LUK,2,NRSV,in peace
2265,LUK,2,NRSV,according to your word
2266,LUK,2,NRSV,for my eyes have seen your salvation
2267,LUK,2,NRSV,which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples
2268,LUK,2,NRSV,a light for revelation to the gentiles
2269,LUK,2,NRSV,and for glory to your people israel
2270,LUK,2,NRSV,and the childs father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him
2271,LUK,2,NRSV,then simeon
2272,LUK,2,NRSV,blessed them and said to his mother mary this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be opposed
2273,LUK,2,NRSV,so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealedand a sword will pierce your own soul too
2274,LUK,2,NRSV,there was also a prophet anna
2275,LUK,2,NRSV,the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher she was of a great age having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage
2276,LUK,2,NRSV,then as a widow to the age of eightyfour she never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day
2277,LUK,2,NRSV,at that moment she came and began to praise god and to speak about the child
2278,LUK,2,NRSV,to all who were looking for the redemption of jerusalem
2279,LUK,2,NRSV,when they had finished everything required by the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth
2280,LUK,2,NRSV,the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom and the favor of god was upon him
2281,LUK,2,NRSV,now every year his parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover
2282,LUK,2,NRSV,and when he was twelve years old they went up as usual for the festival
2283,LUK,2,NRSV,when the festival was ended and they started to return the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but his parents did not know it
2284,LUK,2,NRSV,assuming that he was in the group of travelers they went a days journey then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends
2285,LUK,2,NRSV,when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem to search for him
2286,LUK,2,NRSV,after three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions
2287,LUK,2,NRSV,and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers
2288,LUK,2,NRSV,when his parents
2289,LUK,2,NRSV,saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him child why have you treated us like this look your father and i have been searching for you in great anxiety
2290,LUK,2,NRSV,he said to them why were you searching for me did you not know that i must be in my fathers house
2291,LUK,2,NRSV,but they did not understand what he said to them
2292,LUK,2,NRSV,then he went down with them and came to nazareth and was obedient to them his mother treasured all these things in her heart
2293,LUK,2,NRSV,and jesus increased in wisdom and in years
2294,LUK,2,NRSV,and in divine and human favor
2295,LUK,3,NRSV,in the fifteenth year of the reign of emperor tiberius when pontius pilate was governor of judea and herod was ruler
2296,LUK,3,NRSV,of galilee and his brother philip ruler
2297,LUK,3,NRSV,of the region of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias ruler
2298,LUK,3,NRSV,of abilene
2299,LUK,3,NRSV,during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came to john son of zechariah in the wilderness
2300,LUK,3,NRSV,he went into all the region around the jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins
2301,LUK,3,NRSV,as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet isaiah
2302,LUK,3,NRSV,the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
2303,LUK,3,NRSV,prepare the way of the lord
2304,LUK,3,NRSV,make his paths straight
2305,LUK,3,NRSV,every valley shall be filled
2306,LUK,3,NRSV,and every mountain and hill shall be made low
2307,LUK,3,NRSV,and the crooked shall be made straight
2308,LUK,3,NRSV,and the rough ways made smooth
2309,LUK,3,NRSV,and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
2310,LUK,3,NRSV,john said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come
2311,LUK,3,NRSV,bear fruits worthy of repentance do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our ancestor for i tell you god is able from these stones to raise up children to abraham
2312,LUK,3,NRSV,even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
2313,LUK,3,NRSV,and the crowds asked him what then should we do
2314,LUK,3,NRSV,in reply he said to them whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none and whoever has food must do likewise
2315,LUK,3,NRSV,even tax collectors came to be baptized and they asked him teacher what should we do
2316,LUK,3,NRSV,he said to them collect no more than the amount prescribed for you
2317,LUK,3,NRSV,soldiers also asked him and we what should we do he said to them do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation and be satisfied with your wages
2318,LUK,3,NRSV,as the people were filled with expectation and all were questioning in their hearts concerning john whether he might be the messiah
2319,LUK,3,NRSV,john answered all of them by saying i baptize you with water but one who is more powerful than i is coming i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals he will baptize you with
2320,LUK,3,NRSV,the holy spirit and fire
2321,LUK,3,NRSV,his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire
2322,LUK,3,NRSV,so with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people
2323,LUK,3,NRSV,but herod the ruler
2324,LUK,3,NRSV,who had been rebuked by him because of herodias his brothers wife and because of all the evil things that herod had done
2325,LUK,3,NRSV,added to them all by shutting up john in prison
2326,LUK,3,NRSV,now when all the people were baptized and when jesus also had been baptized and was praying the heaven was opened
2327,LUK,3,NRSV,and the holy spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my son the beloved
2328,LUK,3,NRSV,with you i am well pleased
2329,LUK,3,NRSV,jesus was about thirty years old when he began his work he was the son as was thought of joseph son of heli
2330,LUK,3,NRSV,son of matthat son of levi son of melchi son of jannai son of joseph
2331,LUK,3,NRSV,son of mattathias son of amos son of nahum son of esli son of naggai

2339,LUK,3,NRSV,son of jesse son of obed son of boaz son of sala
2340,LUK,3,NRSV,son of nahshon
2341,LUK,3,NRSV,son of amminadab son of admin son of arni
2342,LUK,3,NRSV,son of hezron son of perez son of judah
2343,LUK,3,NRSV,son of jacob son of isaac son of abraham son of terah son of nahor
2344,LUK,3,NRSV,son of serug son of reu son of peleg son of eber son of shelah

2347,LUK,3,NRSV,son of enos son of seth son of adam son of god
2348,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness
2349,LUK,4,NRSV,where for forty days he was tempted by the devil he ate nothing at all during those days and when they were over he was famished
2350,LUK,4,NRSV,the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become a loaf of bread
2351,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written one does not live by bread alone
2352,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil
2353,LUK,4,NRSV,led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world
2354,LUK,4,NRSV,and the devil
2355,LUK,4,NRSV,said to him to you i will give their glory and all this authority for it has been given over to me and i give it to anyone i please
2356,LUK,4,NRSV,if you then will worship me it will all be yours
2357,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is written
2358,LUK,4,NRSV,worship the lord your god
2359,LUK,4,NRSV,and serve only him
2360,LUK,4,NRSV,then the devil
2361,LUK,4,NRSV,took him to jerusalem and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple saying to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down from here
2362,LUK,4,NRSV,for it is written
2363,LUK,4,NRSV,he will command his angels concerning you
2364,LUK,4,NRSV,to protect you
2365,LUK,4,NRSV,and
2366,LUK,4,NRSV,on their hands they will bear you up
2367,LUK,4,NRSV,so that you will not dash your foot against a stone
2368,LUK,4,NRSV,jesus answered him it is said do not put the lord your god to the test
2369,LUK,4,NRSV,when the devil had finished every test he departed from him until an opportune time
2370,LUK,4,NRSV,then jesus filled with the power of the spirit returned to galilee and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country
2371,LUK,4,NRSV,he began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone
2372,LUK,4,NRSV,when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day as was his custom he stood up to read
2373,LUK,4,NRSV,and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was given to him he unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written
2374,LUK,4,NRSV,the spirit of the lord is upon me
2375,LUK,4,NRSV,because he has anointed me
2376,LUK,4,NRSV,to bring good news to the poor
2377,LUK,4,NRSV,he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
2378,LUK,4,NRSV,and recovery of sight to the blind
2379,LUK,4,NRSV,to let the oppressed go free
2380,LUK,4,NRSV,to proclaim the year of the lords favor
2381,LUK,4,NRSV,and he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
2382,LUK,4,NRSV,then he began to say to them today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing
2383,LUK,4,NRSV,all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth they said is not this josephs son
2384,LUK,4,NRSV,he said to them doubtless you will quote to me this proverb doctor cure yourself and you will say do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at capernaum
2385,LUK,4,NRSV,and he said truly i tell you no prophet is accepted in the prophets hometown
2386,LUK,4,NRSV,but the truth is there were many widows in israel in the time of elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months and there was a severe famine over all the land
2387,LUK,4,NRSV,yet elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at zarephath in sidon
2388,LUK,4,NRSV,there were also many lepers
2389,LUK,4,NRSV,in israel in the time of the prophet elisha and none of them was cleansed except naaman the syrian
2390,LUK,4,NRSV,when they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage
2391,LUK,4,NRSV,they got up drove him out of the town and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff
2392,LUK,4,NRSV,but he passed through the midst of them and went on his way
2393,LUK,4,NRSV,he went down to capernaum a city in galilee and was teaching them on the sabbath
2394,LUK,4,NRSV,they were astounded at his teaching because he spoke with authority
2395,LUK,4,NRSV,in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice
2396,LUK,4,NRSV,let us alone what have you to do with us jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you are the holy one of god
2397,LUK,4,NRSV,but jesus rebuked him saying be silent and come out of him when the demon had thrown him down before them he came out of him without having done him any harm
2398,LUK,4,NRSV,they were all amazed and kept saying to one another what kind of utterance is this for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and out they come
2399,LUK,4,NRSV,and a report about him began to reach every place in the region
2400,LUK,4,NRSV,after leaving the synagogue he entered simons house now simons motherinlaw was suffering from a high fever and they asked him about her
2401,LUK,4,NRSV,then he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her immediately she got up and began to serve them
2402,LUK,4,NRSV,as the sun was setting all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them
2403,LUK,4,NRSV,demons also came out of many shouting you are the son of god but he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the messiah
2404,LUK,4,NRSV,at daybreak he departed and went into a deserted place and the crowds were looking for him and when they reached him they wanted to prevent him from leaving them
2405,LUK,4,NRSV,but he said to them i must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of god to the other cities also for i was sent for this purpose
2406,LUK,4,NRSV,so he continued proclaiming the message in the synagogues of judea
2407,LUK,5,NRSV,once while jesus
2408,LUK,5,NRSV,was standing beside the lake of gennesaret and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of god
2409,LUK,5,NRSV,he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets
2410,LUK,5,NRSV,he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little way from the shore then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat
2411,LUK,5,NRSV,when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch
2412,LUK,5,NRSV,simon answered master we have worked all night long but have caught nothing yet if you say so i will let down the nets
2413,LUK,5,NRSV,when they had done this they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break
2414,LUK,5,NRSV,so they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink
2415,LUK,5,NRSV,but when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying go away from me lord for i am a sinful man
2416,LUK,5,NRSV,for he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken
2417,LUK,5,NRSV,and so also were james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon then jesus said to simon do not be afraid from now on you will be catching people
2418,LUK,5,NRSV,when they had brought their boats to shore they left everything and followed him
2419,LUK,5,NRSV,once when he was in one of the cities there was a man covered with leprosy
2420,LUK,5,NRSV,when he saw jesus he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him lord if you choose you can make me clean
2421,LUK,5,NRSV,then jesus
2422,LUK,5,NRSV,stretched out his hand touched him and said i do choose be made clean immediately the leprosy
2423,LUK,5,NRSV,left him
2424,LUK,5,NRSV,and he ordered him to tell no one go he said and show yourself to the priest and as moses commanded make an offering for your cleansing for a testimony to them
2425,LUK,5,NRSV,but now more than ever the word about jesus
2426,LUK,5,NRSV,spread abroad many crowds would gather to hear him and to be cured of their diseases
2427,LUK,5,NRSV,but he would withdraw to deserted places and pray
2428,LUK,5,NRSV,one day while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting near by they had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal
2429,LUK,5,NRSV,just then some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a bed they were trying to bring him in and lay him before jesus
2430,LUK,5,NRSV,but finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the middle of the crowd
2431,LUK,5,NRSV,in front of jesus
2432,LUK,5,NRSV,when he saw their faith he said friend
2433,LUK,5,NRSV,your sins are forgiven you
2434,LUK,5,NRSV,then the scribes and the pharisees began to question who is this who is speaking blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
2435,LUK,5,NRSV,when jesus perceived their questionings he answered them why do you raise such questions in your hearts
2436,LUK,5,NRSV,which is easier to say your sins are forgiven you or to say stand up and walk
2437,LUK,5,NRSV,but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the one who was paralyzedi say to you stand up and take your bed and go to your home
2438,LUK,5,NRSV,immediately he stood up before them took what he had been lying on and went to his home glorifying god
2439,LUK,5,NRSV,amazement seized all of them and they glorified god and were filled with awe saying we have seen strange things today
2440,LUK,5,NRSV,after this he went out and saw a tax collector named levi sitting at the tax booth and he said to him follow me
2441,LUK,5,NRSV,and he got up left everything and followed him
2442,LUK,5,NRSV,then levi gave a great banquet for him in his house and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table
2443,LUK,5,NRSV,with them
2444,LUK,5,NRSV,the pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
2445,LUK,5,NRSV,jesus answered those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick
2446,LUK,5,NRSV,i have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance
2447,LUK,5,NRSV,then they said to him johns disciples like the disciples of the pharisees frequently fast and pray but your disciples eat and drink
2448,LUK,5,NRSV,jesus said to them you cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them can you
2449,LUK,5,NRSV,the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast in those days
2450,LUK,5,NRSV,he also told them a parable no one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment otherwise the new will be torn and the piece from the new will not match the old
2451,LUK,5,NRSV,and no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed
2452,LUK,5,NRSV,but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins
2453,LUK,5,NRSV,and no one after drinking old wine desires new wine but says the old is good
2454,LUK,6,NRSV,one sabbath
2455,LUK,6,NRSV,while jesus
2456,LUK,6,NRSV,was going through the grainfields his disciples plucked some heads of grain rubbed them in their hands and ate them
2457,LUK,6,NRSV,but some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful
2458,LUK,6,NRSV,on the sabbath
2459,LUK,6,NRSV,jesus answered have you not read what david did when he and his companions were hungry
2460,LUK,6,NRSV,he entered the house of god and took and ate the bread of the presence which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and gave some to his companions
2461,LUK,6,NRSV,then he said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath
2462,LUK,6,NRSV,on another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught and there was a man there whose right hand was withered
2463,LUK,6,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees watched him to see whether he would cure on the sabbath so that they might find an accusation against him
2464,LUK,6,NRSV,even though he knew what they were thinking he said to the man who had the withered hand come and stand here he got up and stood there
2465,LUK,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them i ask you is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to destroy it
2466,LUK,6,NRSV,after looking around at all of them he said to him stretch out your hand he did so and his hand was restored
2467,LUK,6,NRSV,but they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to jesus
2468,LUK,6,NRSV,now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the night in prayer to god
2469,LUK,6,NRSV,and when day came he called his disciples and chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles
2470,LUK,6,NRSV,simon whom he named peter and his brother andrew and james and john and philip and bartholomew
2471,LUK,6,NRSV,and matthew and thomas and james son of alphaeus and simon who was called the zealot
2472,LUK,6,NRSV,and judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor
2473,LUK,6,NRSV,he came down with them and stood on a level place with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all judea jerusalem and the coast of tyre and sidon
2474,LUK,6,NRSV,they had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured
2475,LUK,6,NRSV,and all in the crowd were trying to touch him for power came out from him and healed all of them
2476,LUK,6,NRSV,then he looked up at his disciples and said
2477,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who are poor
2478,LUK,6,NRSV,for yours is the kingdom of god
2479,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who are hungry now
2480,LUK,6,NRSV,for you will be filled
2481,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you who weep now
2482,LUK,6,NRSV,for you will laugh
2483,LUK,6,NRSV,blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you revile you and defame you
2484,LUK,6,NRSV,on account of the son of man
2485,LUK,6,NRSV,rejoice in that day and leap for joy for surely your reward is great in heaven for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets
2486,LUK,6,NRSV,but woe to you who are rich
2487,LUK,6,NRSV,for you have received your consolation
2488,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you who are full now
2489,LUK,6,NRSV,for you will be hungry
2490,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you who are laughing now
2491,LUK,6,NRSV,for you will mourn and weep
2492,LUK,6,NRSV,woe to you when all speak well of you for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets
2493,LUK,6,NRSV,but i say to you that listen love your enemies do good to those who hate you
2494,LUK,6,NRSV,bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you
2495,LUK,6,NRSV,if anyone strikes you on the cheek offer the other also and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt
2496,LUK,6,NRSV,give to everyone who begs from you and if anyone takes away your goods do not ask for them again
2497,LUK,6,NRSV,do to others as you would have them do to you
2498,LUK,6,NRSV,if you love those who love you what credit is that to you for even sinners love those who love them
2499,LUK,6,NRSV,if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you for even sinners do the same
2500,LUK,6,NRSV,if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what credit is that to you even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much again
2501,LUK,6,NRSV,but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return
2502,LUK,6,NRSV,your reward will be great and you will be children of the most high for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked
2503,LUK,6,NRSV,be merciful just as your father is merciful
2504,LUK,6,NRSV,do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven
2505,LUK,6,NRSV,give and it will be given to you a good measure pressed down shaken together running over will be put into your lap for the measure you give will be the measure you get back
2506,LUK,6,NRSV,he also told them a parable can a blind person guide a blind person will not both fall into a pit
2507,LUK,6,NRSV,a disciple is not above the teacher but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher
2508,LUK,6,NRSV,why do you see the speck in your neighbors
2509,LUK,6,NRSV,eye but do not notice the log in your own eye
2510,LUK,6,NRSV,or how can you say to your neighbor
2511,LUK,6,NRSV,friend
2512,LUK,6,NRSV,let me take out the speck in your eye when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbors
2513,LUK,6,NRSV,eye
2514,LUK,6,NRSV,no good tree bears bad fruit nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit
2515,LUK,6,NRSV,for each tree is known by its own fruit figs are not gathered from thorns nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush
2516,LUK,6,NRSV,the good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks
2517,LUK,6,NRSV,why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i tell you
2518,LUK,6,NRSV,i will show you what someone is like who comes to me hears my words and acts on them
2519,LUK,6,NRSV,that one is like a man building a house who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock when a flood arose the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built
2520,LUK,6,NRSV,but the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation when the river burst against it immediately it fell and great was the ruin of that house
2521,LUK,7,NRSV,after jesus
2522,LUK,7,NRSV,had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum
2523,LUK,7,NRSV,a centurion there had a slave whom he valued highly and who was ill and close to death
2524,LUK,7,NRSV,when he heard about jesus he sent some jewish elders to him asking him to come and heal his slave
2525,LUK,7,NRSV,when they came to jesus they appealed to him earnestly saying he is worthy of having you do this for him
2526,LUK,7,NRSV,for he loves our people and it is he who built our synagogue for us
2527,LUK,7,NRSV,and jesus went with them but when he was not far from the house the centurion sent friends to say to him lord do not trouble yourself for i am not worthy to have you come under my roof
2528,LUK,7,NRSV,therefore i did not presume to come to you but only speak the word and let my servant be healed
2529,LUK,7,NRSV,for i also am a man set under authority with soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it
2530,LUK,7,NRSV,when jesus heard this he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd that followed him he said i tell you not even in israel have i found such faith
2531,LUK,7,NRSV,when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the slave in good health
2532,LUK,7,NRSV,soon afterwards
2533,LUK,7,NRSV,he went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went with him
2534,LUK,7,NRSV,as he approached the gate of the town a man who had died was being carried out he was his mothers only son and she was a widow and with her was a large crowd from the town
2535,LUK,7,NRSV,when the lord saw her he had compassion for her and said to her do not weep
2536,LUK,7,NRSV,then he came forward and touched the bier and the bearers stood still and he said young man i say to you rise
2537,LUK,7,NRSV,the dead man sat up and began to speak and jesus
2538,LUK,7,NRSV,gave him to his mother
2539,LUK,7,NRSV,fear seized all of them and they glorified god saying a great prophet has risen among us and god has looked favorably on his people
2540,LUK,7,NRSV,this word about him spread throughout judea and all the surrounding country
2541,LUK,7,NRSV,the disciples of john reported all these things to him so john summoned two of his disciples
2542,LUK,7,NRSV,and sent them to the lord to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another
2543,LUK,7,NRSV,when the men had come to him they said john the baptist has sent us to you to ask are you the one who is to come or are we to wait for another
2544,LUK,7,NRSV,jesus
2545,LUK,7,NRSV,had just then cured many people of diseases plagues and evil spirits and had given sight to many who were blind
2546,LUK,7,NRSV,and he answered them go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers
2547,LUK,7,NRSV,are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news brought to them
2548,LUK,7,NRSV,and blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me
2549,LUK,7,NRSV,when johns messengers had gone jesus
2550,LUK,7,NRSV,began to speak to the crowds about john
2551,LUK,7,NRSV,what did you go out into the wilderness to look at a reed shaken by the wind
2552,LUK,7,NRSV,what then did you go out to see someone
2553,LUK,7,NRSV,dressed in soft robes look those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces
2554,LUK,7,NRSV,what then did you go out to see a prophet yes i tell you and more than a prophet
2555,LUK,7,NRSV,this is the one about whom it is written
2556,LUK,7,NRSV,see i am sending my messenger ahead of you
2557,LUK,7,NRSV,who will prepare your way before you
2558,LUK,7,NRSV,i tell you among those born of women no one is greater than john yet the least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
2559,LUK,7,NRSV,and all the people who heard this including the tax collectors acknowledged the justice of god
2560,LUK,7,NRSV,because they had been baptized with johns baptism
2561,LUK,7,NRSV,but by refusing to be baptized by him the pharisees and the lawyers rejected gods purpose for themselves
2562,LUK,7,NRSV,to what then will i compare the people of this generation and what are they like
2563,LUK,7,NRSV,they are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another
2564,LUK,7,NRSV,we played the flute for you and you did not dance
2565,LUK,7,NRSV,we wailed and you did not weep
2566,LUK,7,NRSV,for john the baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon
2567,LUK,7,NRSV,the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say look a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners
2568,LUK,7,NRSV,nevertheless wisdom is vindicated by all her children
2569,LUK,7,NRSV,one of the pharisees asked jesus
2570,LUK,7,NRSV,to eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and took his place at the table
2571,LUK,7,NRSV,and a woman in the city who was a sinner having learned that he was eating in the pharisees house brought an alabaster jar of ointment
2572,LUK,7,NRSV,she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment
2573,LUK,7,NRSV,now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching himthat she is a sinner
2574,LUK,7,NRSV,jesus spoke up and said to him simon i have something to say to you teacher he replied speak
2575,LUK,7,NRSV,a certain creditor had two debtors one owed five hundred denarii
2576,LUK,7,NRSV,and the other fifty
2577,LUK,7,NRSV,when they could not pay he canceled the debts for both of them now which of them will love him more
2578,LUK,7,NRSV,simon answered i suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt and jesus
2579,LUK,7,NRSV,said to him you have judged rightly
2580,LUK,7,NRSV,then turning toward the woman he said to simon do you see this woman i entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair
2581,LUK,7,NRSV,you gave me no kiss but from the time i came in she has not stopped kissing my feet
2582,LUK,7,NRSV,you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment
2583,LUK,7,NRSV,therefore i tell you her sins which were many have been forgiven hence she has shown great love but the one to whom little is forgiven loves little
2584,LUK,7,NRSV,then he said to her your sins are forgiven
2585,LUK,7,NRSV,but those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves who is this who even forgives sins
2586,LUK,7,NRSV,and he said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace
2587,LUK,8,NRSV,soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him
2588,LUK,8,NRSV,as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out
2589,LUK,8,NRSV,and joanna the wife of herods steward chuza and susanna and many others who provided for them
2590,LUK,8,NRSV,out of their resources
2591,LUK,8,NRSV,when a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him he said in a parable
2592,LUK,8,NRSV,a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell on the path and was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up
2593,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell on the rock and as it grew up it withered for lack of moisture
2594,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell among thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it
2595,LUK,8,NRSV,some fell into good soil and when it grew it produced a hundredfold as he said this he called out let anyone with ears to hear listen
2596,LUK,8,NRSV,then his disciples asked him what this parable meant
2597,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to you it has been given to know the secrets
2598,LUK,8,NRSV,of the kingdom of god but to others i speak
2599,LUK,8,NRSV,in parables so that
2600,LUK,8,NRSV,looking they may not perceive
2601,LUK,8,NRSV,and listening they may not understand
2602,LUK,8,NRSV,now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
2603,LUK,8,NRSV,the ones on the path are those who have heard then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved
2604,LUK,8,NRSV,the ones on the rock are those who when they hear the word receive it with joy but these have no root they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away
2605,LUK,8,NRSV,as for what fell among the thorns these are the ones who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and their fruit does not mature
2606,LUK,8,NRSV,but as for that in the good soil these are the ones who when they hear the word hold it fast in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patient endurance
2607,LUK,8,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light
2608,LUK,8,NRSV,for nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light
2609,LUK,8,NRSV,then pay attention to how you listen for to those who have more will be given and from those who do not have even what they seem to have will be taken away
2610,LUK,8,NRSV,then his mother and his brothers came to him but they could not reach him because of the crowd
2611,LUK,8,NRSV,and he was told your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you
2612,LUK,8,NRSV,but he said to them my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it
2613,LUK,8,NRSV,one day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go across to the other side of the lake so they put out
2614,LUK,8,NRSV,and while they were sailing he fell asleep a windstorm swept down on the lake and the boat was filling with water and they were in danger
2615,LUK,8,NRSV,they went to him and woke him up shouting master master we are perishing and he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves they ceased and there was a calm
2616,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to them where is your faith they were afraid and amazed and said to one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him
2617,LUK,8,NRSV,then they arrived at the country of the gerasenes
2618,LUK,8,NRSV,which is opposite galilee
2619,LUK,8,NRSV,as he stepped out on land a man of the city who had demons met him for a long time he had worn
2620,LUK,8,NRSV,no clothes and he did not live in a house but in the tombs
2621,LUK,8,NRSV,when he saw jesus he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god i beg you do not torment me
2622,LUK,8,NRSV,for jesus
2623,LUK,8,NRSV,had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for many times it had seized him he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds
2624,LUK,8,NRSV,jesus then asked him what is your name he said legion for many demons had entered him
2625,LUK,8,NRSV,they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss
2626,LUK,8,NRSV,now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding and the demons
2627,LUK,8,NRSV,begged jesus
2628,LUK,8,NRSV,to let them enter these so he gave them permission
2629,LUK,8,NRSV,then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned
2630,LUK,8,NRSV,when the swineherds saw what had happened they ran off and told it in the city and in the country
2631,LUK,8,NRSV,then people came out to see what had happened and when they came to jesus they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
2632,LUK,8,NRSV,those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed
2633,LUK,8,NRSV,then all the people of the surrounding country of the gerasenes
2634,LUK,8,NRSV,asked jesus
2635,LUK,8,NRSV,to leave them for they were seized with great fear so he got into the boat and returned
2636,LUK,8,NRSV,the man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him but jesus
2637,LUK,8,NRSV,sent him away saying
2638,LUK,8,NRSV,return to your home and declare how much god has done for you so he went away proclaiming throughout the city how much jesus had done for him
2639,LUK,8,NRSV,now when jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all waiting for him
2640,LUK,8,NRSV,just then there came a man named jairus a leader of the synagogue he fell at jesus feet and begged him to come to his house
2641,LUK,8,NRSV,for he had an only daughter about twelve years old who was dying
2642,LUK,8,NRSV,as he went the crowds pressed in on him
2643,LUK,8,NRSV,now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years and though she had spent all she had on physicians
2644,LUK,8,NRSV,no one could cure her
2645,LUK,8,NRSV,she came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes and immediately her hemorrhage stopped
2646,LUK,8,NRSV,then jesus asked who touched me when all denied it peter
2647,LUK,8,NRSV,said master the crowds surround you and press in on you
2648,LUK,8,NRSV,but jesus said someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me
2649,LUK,8,NRSV,when the woman saw that she could not remain hidden she came trembling and falling down before him she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed
2650,LUK,8,NRSV,he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
2651,LUK,8,NRSV,while he was still speaking someone came from the leaders house to say your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer
2652,LUK,8,NRSV,when jesus heard this he replied do not fear only believe and she will be saved
2653,LUK,8,NRSV,when he came to the house he did not allow anyone to enter with him except peter john and james and the childs father and mother
2654,LUK,8,NRSV,they were all weeping and wailing for her but he said do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping
2655,LUK,8,NRSV,and they laughed at him knowing that she was dead
2656,LUK,8,NRSV,but he took her by the hand and called out child get up
2657,LUK,8,NRSV,her spirit returned and she got up at once then he directed them to give her something to eat
2658,LUK,8,NRSV,her parents were astounded but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened
2659,LUK,9,NRSV,then jesus
2660,LUK,9,NRSV,called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases
2661,LUK,9,NRSV,and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal
2662,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them take nothing for your journey no staff nor bag nor bread nor moneynot even an extra tunic
2663,LUK,9,NRSV,whatever house you enter stay there and leave from there
2664,LUK,9,NRSV,wherever they do not welcome you as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them
2665,LUK,9,NRSV,they departed and went through the villages bringing the good news and curing diseases everywhere
2666,LUK,9,NRSV,now herod the ruler
2667,LUK,9,NRSV,heard about all that had taken place and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had been raised from the dead
2668,LUK,9,NRSV,by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen
2669,LUK,9,NRSV,herod said john i beheaded but who is this about whom i hear such things and he tried to see him
2670,LUK,9,NRSV,on their return the apostles told jesus
2671,LUK,9,NRSV,all they had done he took them with him and withdrew privately to a city called bethsaida
2672,LUK,9,NRSV,when the crowds found out about it they followed him and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and healed those who needed to be cured
2673,LUK,9,NRSV,the day was drawing to a close and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and get provisions for we are here in a deserted place
2674,LUK,9,NRSV,but he said to them you give them something to eat they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we are to go and buy food for all these people
2675,LUK,9,NRSV,for there were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down in groups of about fifty each
2676,LUK,9,NRSV,they did so and made them all sit down
2677,LUK,9,NRSV,and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd
2678,LUK,9,NRSV,and all ate and were filled what was left over was gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces
2679,LUK,9,NRSV,once when jesus
2680,LUK,9,NRSV,was praying alone with only the disciples near him he asked them who do the crowds say that i am
2681,LUK,9,NRSV,they answered john the baptist but others elijah and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen
2682,LUK,9,NRSV,he said to them but who do you say that i am peter answered the messiah
2683,LUK,9,NRSV,of god
2684,LUK,9,NRSV,he sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone
2685,LUK,9,NRSV,saying the son of man must undergo great suffering and be rejected by the elders chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised
2686,LUK,9,NRSV,then he said to them all if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me
2687,LUK,9,NRSV,for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will save it
2688,LUK,9,NRSV,what does it profit them if they gain the whole world but lose or forfeit themselves
2689,LUK,9,NRSV,those who are ashamed of me and of my words of them the son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels
2690,LUK,9,NRSV,but truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god
2691,LUK,9,NRSV,now about eight days after these sayings jesus
2692,LUK,9,NRSV,took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray
2693,LUK,9,NRSV,and while he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became dazzling white
2694,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly they saw two men moses and elijah talking to him
2695,LUK,9,NRSV,they appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem
2696,LUK,9,NRSV,now peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep but since they had stayed awake
2697,LUK,9,NRSV,they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him
2698,LUK,9,NRSV,just as they were leaving him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three dwellings
2699,LUK,9,NRSV,one for you one for moses and one for elijahnot knowing what he said
2700,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were terrified as they entered the cloud
2701,LUK,9,NRSV,then from the cloud came a voice that said this is my son my chosen
2702,LUK,9,NRSV,listen to him
2703,LUK,9,NRSV,when the voice had spoken jesus was found alone and they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen
2704,LUK,9,NRSV,on the next day when they had come down from the mountain a great crowd met him
2705,LUK,9,NRSV,just then a man from the crowd shouted teacher i beg you to look at my son he is my only child
2706,LUK,9,NRSV,suddenly a spirit seizes him and all at once he
2707,LUK,9,NRSV,shrieks it convulses him until he foams at the mouth it mauls him and will scarcely leave him
2708,LUK,9,NRSV,i begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not
2709,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus answered you faithless and perverse generation how much longer must i be with you and bear with you bring your son here
2710,LUK,9,NRSV,while he was coming the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father
2711,LUK,9,NRSV,and all were astounded at the greatness of god
2712,LUK,9,NRSV,while everyone was amazed at all that he was doing he said to his disciples
2713,LUK,9,NRSV,let these words sink into your ears the son of man is going to be betrayed into human hands
2714,LUK,9,NRSV,but they did not understand this saying its meaning was concealed from them so that they could not perceive it and they were afraid to ask him about this saying
2715,LUK,9,NRSV,an argument arose among them as to which one of them was the greatest
2716,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus aware of their inner thoughts took a little child and put it by his side
2717,LUK,9,NRSV,and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for the least among all of you is the greatest
2718,LUK,9,NRSV,john answered master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us
2719,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus said to him do not stop him for whoever is not against you is for you
2720,LUK,9,NRSV,when the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to jerusalem
2721,LUK,9,NRSV,and he sent messengers ahead of him on their way they entered a village of the samaritans to make ready for him
2722,LUK,9,NRSV,but they did not receive him because his face was set toward jerusalem
2723,LUK,9,NRSV,when his disciples james and john saw it they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them
2724,LUK,9,NRSV,but he turned and rebuked them
2725,LUK,9,NRSV,then
2726,LUK,9,NRSV,they went on to another village
2727,LUK,9,NRSV,as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go
2728,LUK,9,NRSV,and jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
2729,LUK,9,NRSV,to another he said follow me but he said lord first let me go and bury my father
2730,LUK,9,NRSV,but jesus
2731,LUK,9,NRSV,said to him let the dead bury their own dead but as for you go and proclaim the kingdom of god
2732,LUK,9,NRSV,another said i will follow you lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home
2733,LUK,9,NRSV,jesus said to him no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of god
2734,LUK,10,NRSV,after this the lord appointed seventy
2735,LUK,10,NRSV,others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go
2736,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to them the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
2737,LUK,10,NRSV,go on your way see i am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves
2738,LUK,10,NRSV,carry no purse no bag no sandals and greet no one on the road
2739,LUK,10,NRSV,whatever house you enter first say peace to this house
2740,LUK,10,NRSV,and if anyone is there who shares in peace your peace will rest on that person but if not it will return to you
2741,LUK,10,NRSV,remain in the same house eating and drinking whatever they provide for the laborer deserves to be paid do not move about from house to house
2742,LUK,10,NRSV,whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you eat what is set before you
2743,LUK,10,NRSV,cure the sick who are there and say to them the kingdom of god has come near to you
2744,LUK,10,NRSV,but whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you go out into its streets and say
2745,LUK,10,NRSV,even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you yet know this the kingdom of god has come near
2746,LUK,10,NRSV,i tell you on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town
2747,LUK,10,NRSV,woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the deeds of power done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes
2748,LUK,10,NRSV,but at the judgment it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon than for you
2749,LUK,10,NRSV,and you capernaum
2750,LUK,10,NRSV,will you be exalted to heaven
2751,LUK,10,NRSV,no you will be brought down to hades
2752,LUK,10,NRSV,whoever listens to you listens to me and whoever rejects you rejects me and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me
2753,LUK,10,NRSV,the seventy
2754,LUK,10,NRSV,returned with joy saying lord in your name even the demons submit to us
2755,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to them i watched satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning
2756,LUK,10,NRSV,see i have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing will hurt you
2757,LUK,10,NRSV,nevertheless do not rejoice at this that the spirits submit to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven
2758,LUK,10,NRSV,at that same hour jesus
2759,LUK,10,NRSV,rejoiced in the holy spirit
2760,LUK,10,NRSV,and said i thank
2761,LUK,10,NRSV,you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants yes father for such was your gracious will
2762,LUK,10,NRSV,all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father or who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him
2763,LUK,10,NRSV,then turning to the disciples jesus
2764,LUK,10,NRSV,said to them privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see
2765,LUK,10,NRSV,for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it
2766,LUK,10,NRSV,just then a lawyer stood up to test jesus
2767,LUK,10,NRSV,teacher he said what must i do to inherit eternal life
2768,LUK,10,NRSV,he said to him what is written in the law what do you read there
2769,LUK,10,NRSV,he answered you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
2770,LUK,10,NRSV,and he said to him you have given the right answer do this and you will live
2771,LUK,10,NRSV,but wanting to justify himself he asked jesus and who is my neighbor
2772,LUK,10,NRSV,jesus replied a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and fell into the hands of robbers who stripped him beat him and went away leaving him half dead
2773,LUK,10,NRSV,now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
2774,LUK,10,NRSV,so likewise a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side
2775,LUK,10,NRSV,but a samaritan while traveling came near him and when he saw him he was moved with pity
2776,LUK,10,NRSV,he went to him and bandaged his wounds having poured oil and wine on them then he put him on his own animal brought him to an inn and took care of him
2777,LUK,10,NRSV,the next day he took out two denarii
2778,LUK,10,NRSV,gave them to the innkeeper and said take care of him and when i come back i will repay you whatever more you spend
2779,LUK,10,NRSV,which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers
2780,LUK,10,NRSV,he said the one who showed him mercy jesus said to him go and do likewise
2781,LUK,10,NRSV,now as they went on their way he entered a certain village where a woman named martha welcomed him into her home
2782,LUK,10,NRSV,she had a sister named mary who sat at the lords feet and listened to what he was saying
2783,LUK,10,NRSV,but martha was distracted by her many tasks so she came to him and asked lord do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself tell her then to help me
2784,LUK,10,NRSV,but the lord answered her martha martha you are worried and distracted by many things
2785,LUK,10,NRSV,there is need of only one thing
2786,LUK,10,NRSV,mary has chosen the better part which will not be taken away from her
2787,LUK,11,NRSV,he was praying in a certain place and after he had finished one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray as john taught his disciples
2788,LUK,11,NRSV,he said to them when you pray say
2789,LUK,11,NRSV,father
2790,LUK,11,NRSV,hallowed be your name
2791,LUK,11,NRSV,your kingdom come
2792,LUK,11,NRSV,give us each day our daily bread
2793,LUK,11,NRSV,and forgive us our sins
2794,LUK,11,NRSV,for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us
2795,LUK,11,NRSV,and do not bring us to the time of trial
2796,LUK,11,NRSV,and he said to them suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves of bread
2797,LUK,11,NRSV,for a friend of mine has arrived and i have nothing to set before him
2798,LUK,11,NRSV,and he answers from within do not bother me the door has already been locked and my children are with me in bed i cannot get up and give you anything
2799,LUK,11,NRSV,i tell you even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs
2800,LUK,11,NRSV,so i say to you ask and it will be given you search and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you
2801,LUK,11,NRSV,for everyone who asks receives and everyone who searches finds and for everyone who knocks the door will be opened
2802,LUK,11,NRSV,is there anyone among you who if your child asks for
2803,LUK,11,NRSV,a fish will give a snake instead of a fish
2804,LUK,11,NRSV,or if the child asks for an egg will give a scorpion
2805,LUK,11,NRSV,if you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will the heavenly father give the holy spirit
2806,LUK,11,NRSV,to those who ask him
2807,LUK,11,NRSV,now he was casting out a demon that was mute when the demon had gone out the one who had been mute spoke and the crowds were amazed
2808,LUK,11,NRSV,but some of them said he casts out demons by beelzebul the ruler of the demons
2809,LUK,11,NRSV,others to test him kept demanding from him a sign from heaven
2810,LUK,11,NRSV,but he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert and house falls on house
2811,LUK,11,NRSV,if satan also is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand for you say that i cast out the demons by beelzebul
2812,LUK,11,NRSV,now if i cast out the demons by beelzebul by whom do your exorcists
2813,LUK,11,NRSV,cast them out therefore they will be your judges
2814,LUK,11,NRSV,but if it is by the finger of god that i cast out the demons then the kingdom of god has come to you
2815,LUK,11,NRSV,when a strong man fully armed guards his castle his property is safe
2816,LUK,11,NRSV,but when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder
2817,LUK,11,NRSV,whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
2818,LUK,11,NRSV,when the unclean spirit has gone out of a person it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place but not finding any it says i will return to my house from which i came
2819,LUK,11,NRSV,when it comes it finds it swept and put in order
2820,LUK,11,NRSV,then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first
2821,LUK,11,NRSV,while he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you
2822,LUK,11,NRSV,but he said blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it
2823,LUK,11,NRSV,when the crowds were increasing he began to say this generation is an evil generation it asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah
2824,LUK,11,NRSV,for just as jonah became a sign to the people of nineveh so the son of man will be to this generation
2825,LUK,11,NRSV,the queen of the south will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of solomon and see something greater than solomon is here
2826,LUK,11,NRSV,the people of nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the proclamation of jonah and see something greater than jonah is here
2827,LUK,11,NRSV,no one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar
2828,LUK,11,NRSV,but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light
2829,LUK,11,NRSV,your eye is the lamp of your body if your eye is healthy your whole body is full of light but if it is not healthy your body is full of darkness
2830,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness
2831,LUK,11,NRSV,if then your whole body is full of light with no part of it in darkness it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays
2832,LUK,11,NRSV,while he was speaking a pharisee invited him to dine with him so he went in and took his place at the table
2833,LUK,11,NRSV,the pharisee was amazed to see that he did not first wash before dinner
2834,LUK,11,NRSV,then the lord said to him now you pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside you are full of greed and wickedness
2835,LUK,11,NRSV,you fools did not the one who made the outside make the inside also
2836,LUK,11,NRSV,so give for alms those things that are within and see everything will be clean for you
2837,LUK,11,NRSV,but woe to you pharisees for you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds and neglect justice and the love of god it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others
2838,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you pharisees for you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
2839,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you for you are like unmarked graves and people walk over them without realizing it
2840,LUK,11,NRSV,one of the lawyers answered him teacher when you say these things you insult us too
2841,LUK,11,NRSV,and he said woe also to you lawyers for you load people with burdens hard to bear and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them
2842,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed
2843,LUK,11,NRSV,so you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors for they killed them and you build their tombs
2844,LUK,11,NRSV,therefore also the wisdom of god said i will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and persecute
2845,LUK,11,NRSV,so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
2846,LUK,11,NRSV,from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary yes i tell you it will be charged against this generation
2847,LUK,11,NRSV,woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not enter yourselves and you hindered those who were entering
2848,LUK,11,NRSV,when he went outside the scribes and the pharisees began to be very hostile toward him and to crossexamine him about many things
2849,LUK,11,NRSV,lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say
2850,LUK,12,NRSV,meanwhile when the crowd gathered by the thousands so that they trampled on one another he began to speak first to his disciples beware of the yeast of the pharisees that is their hypocrisy
2851,LUK,12,NRSV,nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
2852,LUK,12,NRSV,therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops
2853,LUK,12,NRSV,i tell you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after that can do nothing more
2854,LUK,12,NRSV,but i will warn you whom to fear fear him who after he has killed has authority
2855,LUK,12,NRSV,to cast into hell
2856,LUK,12,NRSV,yes i tell you fear him
2857,LUK,12,NRSV,are not five sparrows sold for two pennies yet not one of them is forgotten in gods sight
2858,LUK,12,NRSV,but even the hairs of your head are all counted do not be afraid you are of more value than many sparrows
2859,LUK,12,NRSV,and i tell you everyone who acknowledges me before others the son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of god
2860,LUK,12,NRSV,but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of god
2861,LUK,12,NRSV,and everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven
2862,LUK,12,NRSV,when they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities do not worry about how
2863,LUK,12,NRSV,you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say
2864,LUK,12,NRSV,for the holy spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say
2865,LUK,12,NRSV,someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me
2866,LUK,12,NRSV,but he said to him friend who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you
2867,LUK,12,NRSV,and he said to them take care be on your guard against all kinds of greed for ones life does not consist in the abundance of possessions
2868,LUK,12,NRSV,then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly
2869,LUK,12,NRSV,and he thought to himself what should i do for i have no place to store my crops
2870,LUK,12,NRSV,then he said i will do this i will pull down my barns and build larger ones and there i will store all my grain and my goods
2871,LUK,12,NRSV,and i will say to my soul soul you have ample goods laid up for many years relax eat drink be merry
2872,LUK,12,NRSV,but god said to him you fool this very night your life is being demanded of you and the things you have prepared whose will they be
2873,LUK,12,NRSV,so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god
2874,LUK,12,NRSV,he said to his disciples therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear
2875,LUK,12,NRSV,for life is more than food and the body more than clothing
2876,LUK,12,NRSV,consider the ravens they neither sow nor reap they have neither storehouse nor barn and yet god feeds them of how much more value are you than the birds
2877,LUK,12,NRSV,and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life
2878,LUK,12,NRSV,if then you are not able to do so small a thing as that why do you worry about the rest
2879,LUK,12,NRSV,consider the lilies how they grow they neither toil nor spin
2880,LUK,12,NRSV,yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
2881,LUK,12,NRSV,but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe youyou of little faith
2882,LUK,12,NRSV,and do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink and do not keep worrying
2883,LUK,12,NRSV,for it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things and your father knows that you need them
2884,LUK,12,NRSV,instead strive for his
2885,LUK,12,NRSV,kingdom and these things will be given to you as well
2886,LUK,12,NRSV,do not be afraid little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
2887,LUK,12,NRSV,sell your possessions and give alms make purses for yourselves that do not wear out an unfailing treasure in heaven where no thief comes near and no moth destroys
2888,LUK,12,NRSV,for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
2889,LUK,12,NRSV,be dressed for action and have your lamps lit
2890,LUK,12,NRSV,be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks
2891,LUK,12,NRSV,blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes truly i tell you he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat and he will come and serve them
2892,LUK,12,NRSV,if he comes during the middle of the night or near dawn and finds them so blessed are those slaves
2893,LUK,12,NRSV,but know this if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he
2894,LUK,12,NRSV,would not have let his house be broken into
2895,LUK,12,NRSV,you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an unexpected hour
2896,LUK,12,NRSV,peter said lord are you telling this parable for us or for everyone
2897,LUK,12,NRSV,and the lord said who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves to give them their allowance of food at the proper time
2898,LUK,12,NRSV,blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives
2899,LUK,12,NRSV,truly i tell you he will put that one in charge of all his possessions
2900,LUK,12,NRSV,but if that slave says to himself my master is delayed in coming and if he begins to beat the other slaves men and women and to eat and drink and get drunk
2901,LUK,12,NRSV,the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know and will cut him in pieces
2902,LUK,12,NRSV,and put him with the unfaithful
2903,LUK,12,NRSV,that slave who knew what his master wanted but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted will receive a severe beating
2904,LUK,12,NRSV,but the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating from everyone to whom much has been given much will be required and from the one to whom much has been entrusted even more will be demanded
2905,LUK,12,NRSV,i came to bring fire to the earth and how i wish it were already kindled
2906,LUK,12,NRSV,i have a baptism with which to be baptized and what stress i am under until it is completed
2907,LUK,12,NRSV,do you think that i have come to bring peace to the earth no i tell you but rather division
2908,LUK,12,NRSV,from now on five in one household will be divided three against two and two against three
2909,LUK,12,NRSV,they will be divided
2910,LUK,12,NRSV,father against son
2911,LUK,12,NRSV,and son against father
2912,LUK,12,NRSV,mother against daughter
2913,LUK,12,NRSV,and daughter against mother
2914,LUK,12,NRSV,motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw
2915,LUK,12,NRSV,and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw
2916,LUK,12,NRSV,he also said to the crowds when you see a cloud rising in the west you immediately say it is going to rain and so it happens
2917,LUK,12,NRSV,and when you see the south wind blowing you say there will be scorching heat and it happens
2918,LUK,12,NRSV,you hypocrites you know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky but why do you not know how to interpret the present time
2919,LUK,12,NRSV,and why do you not judge for yourselves what is right
2920,LUK,12,NRSV,thus when you go with your accuser before a magistrate on the way make an effort to settle the case
2921,LUK,12,NRSV,or you may be dragged before the judge and the judge hand you over to the officer and the officer throw you in prison
2922,LUK,12,NRSV,i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny
2923,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very time there were some present who told him about the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
2924,LUK,13,NRSV,he asked them do you think that because these galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other galileans
2925,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish as they did
2926,LUK,13,NRSV,or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of siloam fell on themdo you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in jerusalem
2927,LUK,13,NRSV,no i tell you but unless you repent you will all perish just as they did
2928,LUK,13,NRSV,then he told this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and found none
2929,LUK,13,NRSV,so he said to the gardener see here for three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and still i find none cut it down why should it be wasting the soil
2930,LUK,13,NRSV,he replied sir let it alone for one more year until i dig around it and put manure on it
2931,LUK,13,NRSV,if it bears fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down
2932,LUK,13,NRSV,now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
2933,LUK,13,NRSV,and just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years she was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight
2934,LUK,13,NRSV,when jesus saw her he called her over and said woman you are set free from your ailment
2935,LUK,13,NRSV,when he laid his hands on her immediately she stood up straight and began praising god
2936,LUK,13,NRSV,but the leader of the synagogue indignant because jesus had cured on the sabbath kept saying to the crowd there are six days on which work ought to be done come on those days and be cured and not on the sabbath day
2937,LUK,13,NRSV,but the lord answered him and said you hypocrites does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water
2938,LUK,13,NRSV,and ought not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day
2939,LUK,13,NRSV,when he said this all his opponents were put to shame and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing
2940,LUK,13,NRSV,he said therefore what is the kingdom of god like and to what should i compare it
2941,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made nests in its branches
2942,LUK,13,NRSV,and again he said to what should i compare the kingdom of god
2943,LUK,13,NRSV,it is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with
2944,LUK,13,NRSV,three measures of flour until all of it was leavened
2945,LUK,13,NRSV,jesus
2946,LUK,13,NRSV,went through one town and village after another teaching as he made his way to jerusalem
2947,LUK,13,NRSV,someone asked him lord will only a few be saved he said to them
2948,LUK,13,NRSV,strive to enter through the narrow door for many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able
2949,LUK,13,NRSV,when once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door saying lord open to us then in reply he will say to you i do not know where you come from
2950,LUK,13,NRSV,then you will begin to say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets
2951,LUK,13,NRSV,but he will say i do not know where you come from go away from me all you evildoers
2952,LUK,13,NRSV,there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrown out
2953,LUK,13,NRSV,then people will come from east and west from north and south and will eat in the kingdom of god
2954,LUK,13,NRSV,indeed some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last
2955,LUK,13,NRSV,at that very hour some pharisees came and said to him get away from here for herod wants to kill you
2956,LUK,13,NRSV,he said to them go and tell that fox for me
2957,LUK,13,NRSV,listen i am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow and on the third day i finish my work
2958,LUK,13,NRSV,yet today tomorrow and the next day i must be on my way because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of jerusalem
2959,LUK,13,NRSV,jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it how often have i desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing
2960,LUK,13,NRSV,see your house is left to you and i tell you you will not see me until the time comes when
2961,LUK,13,NRSV,you say blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
2962,LUK,14,NRSV,on one occasion when jesus
2963,LUK,14,NRSV,was going to the house of a leader of the pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath they were watching him closely
2964,LUK,14,NRSV,just then in front of him there was a man who had dropsy
2965,LUK,14,NRSV,and jesus asked the lawyers and pharisees is it lawful to cure people on the sabbath or not
2966,LUK,14,NRSV,but they were silent so jesus
2967,LUK,14,NRSV,took him and healed him and sent him away
2968,LUK,14,NRSV,then he said to them if one of you has a child
2969,LUK,14,NRSV,or an ox that has fallen into a well will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day
2970,LUK,14,NRSV,and they could not reply to this
2971,LUK,14,NRSV,when he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor he told them a parable
2972,LUK,14,NRSV,when you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet do not sit down at the place of honor in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host
2973,LUK,14,NRSV,and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you give this person your place and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place
2974,LUK,14,NRSV,but when you are invited go and sit down at the lowest place so that when your host comes he may say to you friend move up higher then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you
2975,LUK,14,NRSV,for all who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted
2976,LUK,14,NRSV,he said also to the one who had invited him when you give a luncheon or a dinner do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors in case they may invite you in return and you would be repaid
2977,LUK,14,NRSV,but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame and the blind
2978,LUK,14,NRSV,and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous
2979,LUK,14,NRSV,one of the dinner guests on hearing this said to him blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of god
2980,LUK,14,NRSV,then jesus
2981,LUK,14,NRSV,said to him someone gave a great dinner and invited many
2982,LUK,14,NRSV,at the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited come for everything is ready now
2983,LUK,14,NRSV,but they all alike began to make excuses the first said to him i have bought a piece of land and i must go out and see it please accept my regrets
2984,LUK,14,NRSV,another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i am going to try them out please accept my regrets
2985,LUK,14,NRSV,another said i have just been married and therefore i cannot come
2986,LUK,14,NRSV,so the slave returned and reported this to his master then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame
2987,LUK,14,NRSV,and the slave said sir what you ordered has been done and there is still room
2988,LUK,14,NRSV,then the master said to the slave go out into the roads and lanes and compel people to come in so that my house may be filled
2989,LUK,14,NRSV,for i tell you
2990,LUK,14,NRSV,none of those who were invited will taste my dinner
2991,LUK,14,NRSV,now large crowds were traveling with him and he turned and said to them
2992,LUK,14,NRSV,whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and even life itself cannot be my disciple
2993,LUK,14,NRSV,whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple
2994,LUK,14,NRSV,for which of you intending to build a tower does not first sit down and estimate the cost to see whether he has enough to complete it
2995,LUK,14,NRSV,otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all who see it will begin to ridicule him
2996,LUK,14,NRSV,saying this fellow began to build and was not able to finish
2997,LUK,14,NRSV,or what king going out to wage war against another king will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand
2998,LUK,14,NRSV,if he cannot then while the other is still far away he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace
2999,LUK,14,NRSV,so therefore none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions
3000,LUK,14,NRSV,salt is good but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored
3001,LUK,14,NRSV,it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile they throw it away let anyone with ears to hear listen
3002,LUK,15,NRSV,now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him
3003,LUK,15,NRSV,and the pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying this fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them
3004,LUK,15,NRSV,so he told them this parable
3005,LUK,15,NRSV,which one of you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them does not leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it
3006,LUK,15,NRSV,when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices
3007,LUK,15,NRSV,and when he comes home he calls together his friends and neighbors saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep that was lost
3008,LUK,15,NRSV,just so i tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninetynine righteous persons who need no repentance
3009,LUK,15,NRSV,or what woman having ten silver coins
3010,LUK,15,NRSV,if she loses one of them does not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it
3011,LUK,15,NRSV,when she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the coin that i had lost
3012,LUK,15,NRSV,just so i tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents
3013,LUK,15,NRSV,then jesus
3014,LUK,15,NRSV,said there was a man who had two sons
3015,LUK,15,NRSV,the younger of them said to his father father give me the share of the property that will belong to me so he divided his property between them
3016,LUK,15,NRSV,a few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country and there he squandered his property in dissolute living
3017,LUK,15,NRSV,when he had spent everything a severe famine took place throughout that country and he began to be in need
3018,LUK,15,NRSV,so he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs
3019,LUK,15,NRSV,he would gladly have filled himself with
3020,LUK,15,NRSV,the pods that the pigs were eating and no one gave him anything
3021,LUK,15,NRSV,but when he came to himself he said how many of my fathers hired hands have bread enough and to spare but here i am dying of hunger
3022,LUK,15,NRSV,i will get up and go to my father and i will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you
3023,LUK,15,NRSV,i am no longer worthy to be called your son treat me like one of your hired hands
3024,LUK,15,NRSV,so he set off and went to his father but while he was still far off his father saw him and was filled with compassion he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him
3025,LUK,15,NRSV,then the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and before you i am no longer worthy to be called your son
3026,LUK,15,NRSV,but the father said to his slaves quickly bring out a robethe best oneand put it on him put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet
3027,LUK,15,NRSV,and get the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate
3028,LUK,15,NRSV,for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to celebrate
3029,LUK,15,NRSV,now his elder son was in the field and when he came and approached the house he heard music and dancing
3030,LUK,15,NRSV,he called one of the slaves and asked what was going on
3031,LUK,15,NRSV,he replied your brother has come and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has got him back safe and sound
3032,LUK,15,NRSV,then he became angry and refused to go in his father came out and began to plead with him
3033,LUK,15,NRSV,but he answered his father listen for all these years i have been working like a slave for you and i have never disobeyed your command yet you have never given me even a young goat so that i might celebrate with my friends
3034,LUK,15,NRSV,but when this son of yours came back who has devoured your property with prostitutes you killed the fatted calf for him
3035,LUK,15,NRSV,then the father
3036,LUK,15,NRSV,said to him son you are always with me and all that is mine is yours
3037,LUK,15,NRSV,but we had to celebrate and rejoice because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life he was lost and has been found
3038,LUK,16,NRSV,then jesus
3039,LUK,16,NRSV,said to the disciples there was a rich man who had a manager and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property
3040,LUK,16,NRSV,so he summoned him and said to him what is this that i hear about you give me an accounting of your management because you cannot be my manager any longer
3041,LUK,16,NRSV,then the manager said to himself what will i do now that my master is taking the position away from me i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg
3042,LUK,16,NRSV,i have decided what to do so that when i am dismissed as manager people may welcome me into their homes
3043,LUK,16,NRSV,so summoning his masters debtors one by one he asked the first how much do you owe my master
3044,LUK,16,NRSV,he answered a hundred jugs of olive oil he said to him take your bill sit down quickly and make it fifty
3045,LUK,16,NRSV,then he asked another and how much do you owe he replied a hundred containers of wheat he said to him take your bill and make it eighty
3046,LUK,16,NRSV,and his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light
3047,LUK,16,NRSV,and i tell you make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth
3048,LUK,16,NRSV,so that when it is gone they may welcome you into the eternal homes
3049,LUK,16,NRSV,whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much
3050,LUK,16,NRSV,if then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth
3051,LUK,16,NRSV,who will entrust to you the true riches
3052,LUK,16,NRSV,and if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another who will give you what is your own
3053,LUK,16,NRSV,no slave can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and wealth
3054,LUK,16,NRSV,the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all this and they ridiculed him
3055,LUK,16,NRSV,so he said to them you are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others but god knows your hearts for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of god
3056,LUK,16,NRSV,the law and the prophets were in effect until john came since then the good news of the kingdom of god is proclaimed and everyone tries to enter it by force
3057,LUK,16,NRSV,but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped
3058,LUK,16,NRSV,anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery
3059,LUK,16,NRSV,there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day
3060,LUK,16,NRSV,and at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus covered with sores
3061,LUK,16,NRSV,who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs would come and lick his sores
3062,LUK,16,NRSV,the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with abraham
3063,LUK,16,NRSV,the rich man also died and was buried
3064,LUK,16,NRSV,in hades where he was being tormented he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side
3065,LUK,16,NRSV,he called out father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in agony in these flames
3066,LUK,16,NRSV,but abraham said child remember that during your lifetime you received your good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony
3067,LUK,16,NRSV,besides all this between you and us a great chasm has been fixed so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so and no one can cross from there to us
3068,LUK,16,NRSV,he said then father i beg you to send him to my fathers house
3069,LUK,16,NRSV,for i have five brothersthat he may warn them so that they will not also come into this place of torment
3070,LUK,16,NRSV,abraham replied they have moses and the prophets they should listen to them
3071,LUK,16,NRSV,he said no father abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent
3072,LUK,16,NRSV,he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead
3073,LUK,17,NRSV,jesus
3074,LUK,17,NRSV,said to his disciples occasions for stumbling are bound to come but woe to anyone by whom they come
3075,LUK,17,NRSV,it would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble
3076,LUK,17,NRSV,be on your guard if another disciple
3077,LUK,17,NRSV,sins you must rebuke the offender and if there is repentance you must forgive
3078,LUK,17,NRSV,and if the same person sins against you seven times a day and turns back to you seven times and says i repent you must forgive
3079,LUK,17,NRSV,the apostles said to the lord increase our faith
3080,LUK,17,NRSV,the lord replied if you had faith the size of a
3081,LUK,17,NRSV,mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you
3082,LUK,17,NRSV,who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field come here at once and take your place at the table
3083,LUK,17,NRSV,would you not rather say to him prepare supper for me put on your apron and serve me while i eat and drink later you may eat and drink
3084,LUK,17,NRSV,do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded
3085,LUK,17,NRSV,so you also when you have done all that you were ordered to do say we are worthless slaves we have done only what we ought to have done
3086,LUK,17,NRSV,on the way to jerusalem jesus
3087,LUK,17,NRSV,was going through the region between samaria and galilee
3088,LUK,17,NRSV,as he entered a village ten lepers
3089,LUK,17,NRSV,approached him keeping their distance
3090,LUK,17,NRSV,they called out saying jesus master have mercy on us
3091,LUK,17,NRSV,when he saw them he said to them go and show yourselves to the priests and as they went they were made clean
3092,LUK,17,NRSV,then one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back praising god with a loud voice
3093,LUK,17,NRSV,he prostrated himself at jesus
3094,LUK,17,NRSV,feet and thanked him and he was a samaritan
3095,LUK,17,NRSV,then jesus asked were not ten made clean but the other nine where are they
3096,LUK,17,NRSV,was none of them found to return and give praise to god except this foreigner
3097,LUK,17,NRSV,then he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well
3098,LUK,17,NRSV,once jesus
3099,LUK,17,NRSV,was asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god was coming and he answered the kingdom of god is not coming with things that can be observed
3100,LUK,17,NRSV,nor will they say look here it is or there it is for in fact the kingdom of god is among
3101,LUK,17,NRSV,you
3102,LUK,17,NRSV,then he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man and you will not see it
3103,LUK,17,NRSV,they will say to you look there or look here do not go do not set off in pursuit
3104,LUK,17,NRSV,for as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other so will the son of man be in his day
3105,LUK,17,NRSV,but first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation
3106,LUK,17,NRSV,just as it was in the days of noah so too it will be in the days of the son of man
3107,LUK,17,NRSV,they were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed all of them
3108,LUK,17,NRSV,likewise just as it was in the days of lot they were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building
3109,LUK,17,NRSV,but on the day that lot left sodom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them
3110,LUK,17,NRSV,it will be like that on the day that the son of man is revealed
3111,LUK,17,NRSV,on that day anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back
3112,LUK,17,NRSV,remember lots wife
3113,LUK,17,NRSV,those who try to make their life secure will lose it but those who lose their life will keep it
3114,LUK,17,NRSV,i tell you on that night there will be two in one bed one will be taken and the other left
3115,LUK,17,NRSV,there will be two women grinding meal together one will be taken and the other left
3116,LUK,17,NRSV,then they asked him where lord he said to them where the corpse is there the vultures will gather
3117,LUK,18,NRSV,then jesus
3118,LUK,18,NRSV,told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart
3119,LUK,18,NRSV,he said in a certain city there was a judge who neither feared god nor had respect for people
3120,LUK,18,NRSV,in that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying grant me justice against my opponent
3121,LUK,18,NRSV,for a while he refused but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god and no respect for anyone
3122,LUK,18,NRSV,yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will grant her justice so that she may not wear me out by continually coming
3123,LUK,18,NRSV,and the lord said listen to what the unjust judge says
3124,LUK,18,NRSV,and will not god grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night will he delay long in helping them
3125,LUK,18,NRSV,i tell you he will quickly grant justice to them and yet when the son of man comes will he find faith on earth
3126,LUK,18,NRSV,he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt
3127,LUK,18,NRSV,two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector
3128,LUK,18,NRSV,the pharisee standing by himself was praying thus god i thank you that i am not like other people thieves rogues adulterers or even like this tax collector
3129,LUK,18,NRSV,i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income
3130,LUK,18,NRSV,but the tax collector standing far off would not even look up to heaven but was beating his breast and saying god be merciful to me a sinner
3131,LUK,18,NRSV,i tell you this man went down to his home justified rather than the other for all who exalt themselves will be humbled but all who humble themselves will be exalted
3132,LUK,18,NRSV,people were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them and when the disciples saw it they sternly ordered them not to do it
3133,LUK,18,NRSV,but jesus called for them and said let the little children come to me and do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of god belongs
3134,LUK,18,NRSV,truly i tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will never enter it
3135,LUK,18,NRSV,a certain ruler asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
3136,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him why do you call me good no one is good but god alone
3137,LUK,18,NRSV,you know the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother
3138,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied i have kept all these since my youth
3139,LUK,18,NRSV,when jesus heard this he said to him there is still one thing lacking sell all that you own and distribute the money
3140,LUK,18,NRSV,to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
3141,LUK,18,NRSV,but when he heard this he became sad for he was very rich
3142,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god
3143,LUK,18,NRSV,indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god
3144,LUK,18,NRSV,those who heard it said then who can be saved
3145,LUK,18,NRSV,he replied what is impossible for mortals is possible for god
3146,LUK,18,NRSV,then peter said look we have left our homes and followed you
3147,LUK,18,NRSV,and he said to them truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god
3148,LUK,18,NRSV,who will not get back very much more in this age and in the age to come eternal life
3149,LUK,18,NRSV,then he took the twelve aside and said to them see we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written about the son of man by the prophets will be accomplished
3150,LUK,18,NRSV,for he will be handed over to the gentiles and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon
3151,LUK,18,NRSV,after they have flogged him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again
3152,LUK,18,NRSV,but they understood nothing about all these things in fact what he said was hidden from them and they did not grasp what was said
3153,LUK,18,NRSV,as he approached jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging
3154,LUK,18,NRSV,when he heard a crowd going by he asked what was happening
3155,LUK,18,NRSV,they told him jesus of nazareth
3156,LUK,18,NRSV,is passing by
3157,LUK,18,NRSV,then he shouted jesus son of david have mercy on me
3158,LUK,18,NRSV,those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet but he shouted even more loudly son of david have mercy on me
3159,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him and when he came near he asked him
3160,LUK,18,NRSV,what do you want me to do for you he said lord let me see again
3161,LUK,18,NRSV,jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has saved you
3162,LUK,18,NRSV,immediately he regained his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it praised god
3163,LUK,19,NRSV,he entered jericho and was passing through it
3164,LUK,19,NRSV,a man was there named zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was rich
3165,LUK,19,NRSV,he was trying to see who jesus was but on account of the crowd he could not because he was short in stature
3166,LUK,19,NRSV,so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him because he was going to pass that way
3167,LUK,19,NRSV,when jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him zacchaeus hurry and come down for i must stay at your house today
3168,LUK,19,NRSV,so he hurried down and was happy to welcome him
3169,LUK,19,NRSV,all who saw it began to grumble and said he has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner
3170,LUK,19,NRSV,zacchaeus stood there and said to the lord look half of my possessions lord i will give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i will pay back four times as much
3171,LUK,19,NRSV,then jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham
3172,LUK,19,NRSV,for the son of man came to seek out and to save the lost
3173,LUK,19,NRSV,as they were listening to this he went on to tell a parable because he was near jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of god was to appear immediately
3174,LUK,19,NRSV,so he said a nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return
3175,LUK,19,NRSV,he summoned ten of his slaves and gave them ten pounds
3176,LUK,19,NRSV,and said to them do business with these until i come back
3177,LUK,19,NRSV,but the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him saying we do not want this man to rule over us
3178,LUK,19,NRSV,when he returned having received royal power he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading
3179,LUK,19,NRSV,the first came forward and said lord your pound has made ten more pounds
3180,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him well done good slave because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing take charge of ten cities
3181,LUK,19,NRSV,then the second came saying lord your pound has made five pounds
3182,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him and you rule over five cities
3183,LUK,19,NRSV,then the other came saying lord here is your pound i wrapped it up in a piece of cloth
3184,LUK,19,NRSV,for i was afraid of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow
3185,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to him i will judge you by your own words you wicked slave you knew did you that i was a harsh man taking what i did not deposit and reaping what i did not sow
3186,LUK,19,NRSV,why then did you not put my money into the bank then when i returned i could have collected it with interest
3187,LUK,19,NRSV,he said to the bystanders take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds
3188,LUK,19,NRSV,and they said to him lord he has ten pounds
3189,LUK,19,NRSV,i tell you to all those who have more will be given but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
3190,LUK,19,NRSV,but as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here and slaughter them in my presence
3191,LUK,19,NRSV,after he had said this he went on ahead going up to jerusalem
3192,LUK,19,NRSV,when he had come near bethphage and bethany at the place called the mount of olives he sent two of the disciples
3193,LUK,19,NRSV,saying go into the village ahead of you and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it here
3194,LUK,19,NRSV,if anyone asks you why are you untying it just say this the lord needs it
3195,LUK,19,NRSV,so those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them
3196,LUK,19,NRSV,as they were untying the colt its owners asked them why are you untying the colt
3197,LUK,19,NRSV,they said the lord needs it
3198,LUK,19,NRSV,then they brought it to jesus and after throwing their cloaks on the colt they set jesus on it
3199,LUK,19,NRSV,as he rode along people kept spreading their cloaks on the road
3200,LUK,19,NRSV,as he was now approaching the path down from the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise god joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen
3201,LUK,19,NRSV,saying
3202,LUK,19,NRSV,blessed is the king
3203,LUK,19,NRSV,who comes in the name of the lord
3204,LUK,19,NRSV,peace in heaven
3205,LUK,19,NRSV,and glory in the highest heaven
3206,LUK,19,NRSV,some of the pharisees in the crowd said to him teacher order your disciples to stop
3207,LUK,19,NRSV,he answered i tell you if these were silent the stones would shout out
3208,LUK,19,NRSV,as he came near and saw the city he wept over it
3209,LUK,19,NRSV,saying if you even you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace but now they are hidden from your eyes
3210,LUK,19,NRSV,indeed the days will come upon you when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you and hem you in on every side
3211,LUK,19,NRSV,they will crush you to the ground you and your children within you and they will not leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from god
3212,LUK,19,NRSV,then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there
3213,LUK,19,NRSV,and he said it is written
3214,LUK,19,NRSV,my house shall be a house of prayer
3215,LUK,19,NRSV,but you have made it a den of robbers
3216,LUK,19,NRSV,every day he was teaching in the temple the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him
3217,LUK,19,NRSV,but they did not find anything they could do for all the people were spellbound by what they heard
3218,LUK,20,NRSV,one day as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders
3219,LUK,20,NRSV,and said to him tell us by what authority are you doing these things who is it who gave you this authority
3220,LUK,20,NRSV,he answered them i will also ask you a question and you tell me
3221,LUK,20,NRSV,did the baptism of john come from heaven or was it of human origin
3222,LUK,20,NRSV,they discussed it with one another saying if we say from heaven he will say why did you not believe him
3223,LUK,20,NRSV,but if we say of human origin all the people will stone us for they are convinced that john was a prophet
3224,LUK,20,NRSV,so they answered that they did not know where it came from
3225,LUK,20,NRSV,then jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things
3226,LUK,20,NRSV,he began to tell the people this parable a man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants and went to another country for a long time
3227,LUK,20,NRSV,when the season came he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard but the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded
3228,LUK,20,NRSV,next he sent another slave that one also they beat and insulted and sent away emptyhanded
3229,LUK,20,NRSV,and he sent still a third this one also they wounded and threw out
3230,LUK,20,NRSV,then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do i will send my beloved son perhaps they will respect him
3231,LUK,20,NRSV,but when the tenants saw him they discussed it among themselves and said this is the heir let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours
3232,LUK,20,NRSV,so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them
3233,LUK,20,NRSV,he will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others when they heard this they said heaven forbid
3234,LUK,20,NRSV,but he looked at them and said what then does this text mean
3235,LUK,20,NRSV,the stone that the builders rejected
3236,LUK,20,NRSV,has become the cornerstone
3237,LUK,20,NRSV,everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces and it will crush anyone on whom it falls
3238,LUK,20,NRSV,when the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour but they feared the people
3239,LUK,20,NRSV,so they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest in order to trap him by what he said so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor
3240,LUK,20,NRSV,so they asked him teacher we know that you are right in what you say and teach and you show deference to no one but teach the way of god in accordance with truth
3241,LUK,20,NRSV,is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not
3242,LUK,20,NRSV,but he perceived their craftiness and said to them
3243,LUK,20,NRSV,show me a denarius whose head and whose title does it bear they said the emperors
3244,LUK,20,NRSV,he said to them then give to the emperor the things that are the emperors and to god the things that are gods
3245,LUK,20,NRSV,and they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said and being amazed by his answer they became silent
3246,LUK,20,NRSV,some sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came to him
3247,LUK,20,NRSV,and asked him a question teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but no children the man
3248,LUK,20,NRSV,shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother
3249,LUK,20,NRSV,now there were seven brothers the first married and died childless
3250,LUK,20,NRSV,then the second
3251,LUK,20,NRSV,and the third married her and so in the same way all seven died childless
3252,LUK,20,NRSV,finally the woman also died
3253,LUK,20,NRSV,in the resurrection therefore whose wife will the woman be for the seven had married her
3254,LUK,20,NRSV,jesus said to them those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage
3255,LUK,20,NRSV,but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
3256,LUK,20,NRSV,indeed they cannot die anymore because they are like angels and are children of god being children of the resurrection
3257,LUK,20,NRSV,and the fact that the dead are raised moses himself showed in the story about the bush where he speaks of the lord as the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
3258,LUK,20,NRSV,now he is god not of the dead but of the living for to him all of them are alive
3259,LUK,20,NRSV,then some of the scribes answered teacher you have spoken well
3260,LUK,20,NRSV,for they no longer dared to ask him another question
3261,LUK,20,NRSV,then he said to them how can they say that the messiah
3262,LUK,20,NRSV,is davids son
3263,LUK,20,NRSV,for david himself says in the book of psalms
3264,LUK,20,NRSV,the lord said to my lord
3265,LUK,20,NRSV,sit at my right hand
3266,LUK,20,NRSV,until i make your enemies your footstool
3267,LUK,20,NRSV,david thus calls him lord so how can he be his son
3268,LUK,20,NRSV,in the hearing of all the people he said to the
3269,LUK,20,NRSV,disciples
3270,LUK,20,NRSV,beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets
3271,LUK,20,NRSV,they devour widows houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers they will receive the greater condemnation
3272,LUK,21,NRSV,he looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the treasury
3273,LUK,21,NRSV,he also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins
3274,LUK,21,NRSV,he said truly i tell you this poor widow has put in more than all of them
3275,LUK,21,NRSV,for all of them have contributed out of their abundance but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on
3276,LUK,21,NRSV,when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to god he said
3277,LUK,21,NRSV,as for these things that you see the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another all will be thrown down
3278,LUK,21,NRSV,they asked him teacher when will this be and what will be the sign that this is about to take place
3279,LUK,21,NRSV,and he said beware that you are not led astray for many will come in my name and say i am he
3280,LUK,21,NRSV,and the time is near
3281,LUK,21,NRSV,do not go after them
3282,LUK,21,NRSV,when you hear of wars and insurrections do not be terrified for these things must take place first but the end will not follow immediately
3283,LUK,21,NRSV,then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
3284,LUK,21,NRSV,there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven
3285,LUK,21,NRSV,but before all this occurs they will arrest you and persecute you they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name
3286,LUK,21,NRSV,this will give you an opportunity to testify
3287,LUK,21,NRSV,so make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance
3288,LUK,21,NRSV,for i will give you words
3289,LUK,21,NRSV,and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict
3290,LUK,21,NRSV,you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers by relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death
3291,LUK,21,NRSV,you will be hated by all because of my name
3292,LUK,21,NRSV,but not a hair of your head will perish
3293,LUK,21,NRSV,by your endurance you will gain your souls
3294,LUK,21,NRSV,when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near
3295,LUK,21,NRSV,then those in judea must flee to the mountains and those inside the city must leave it and those out in the country must not enter it
3296,LUK,21,NRSV,for these are days of vengeance as a fulfillment of all that is written
3297,LUK,21,NRSV,woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days for there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people
3298,LUK,21,NRSV,they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations and jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled
3299,LUK,21,NRSV,there will be signs in the sun the moon and the stars and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves
3300,LUK,21,NRSV,people will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world for the powers of the heavens will be shaken
3301,LUK,21,NRSV,then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
3302,LUK,21,NRSV,now when these things begin to take place stand up and raise your heads because your redemption is drawing near
3303,LUK,21,NRSV,then he told them a parable look at the fig tree and all the trees
3304,LUK,21,NRSV,as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near
3305,LUK,21,NRSV,so also when you see these things taking place you know that the kingdom of god is near
3306,LUK,21,NRSV,truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place
3307,LUK,21,NRSV,heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
3308,LUK,21,NRSV,be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life and that day catch you unexpectedly
3309,LUK,21,NRSV,like a trap for it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth
3310,LUK,21,NRSV,be alert at all times praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man
3311,LUK,21,NRSV,every day he was teaching in the temple and at night he would go out and spend the night on the mount of olives as it was called
3312,LUK,21,NRSV,and all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple
3313,LUK,22,NRSV,now the festival of unleavened bread which is called the passover was near
3314,LUK,22,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put jesus
3315,LUK,22,NRSV,to death for they were afraid of the people
3316,LUK,22,NRSV,then satan entered into judas called iscariot who was one of the twelve
3317,LUK,22,NRSV,he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them
3318,LUK,22,NRSV,they were greatly pleased and agreed to give him money
3319,LUK,22,NRSV,so he consented and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present
3320,LUK,22,NRSV,then came the day of unleavened bread on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed
3321,LUK,22,NRSV,so jesus
3322,LUK,22,NRSV,sent peter and john saying go and prepare the passover meal for us that we may eat it
3323,LUK,22,NRSV,they asked him where do you want us to make preparations for it
3324,LUK,22,NRSV,listen he said to them when you have entered the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him into the house he enters
3325,LUK,22,NRSV,and say to the owner of the house the teacher asks you where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
3326,LUK,22,NRSV,he will show you a large room upstairs already furnished make preparations for us there
3327,LUK,22,NRSV,so they went and found everything as he had told them and they prepared the passover meal
3328,LUK,22,NRSV,when the hour came he took his place at the table and the apostles with him
3329,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
3330,LUK,22,NRSV,for i tell you i will not eat it
3331,LUK,22,NRSV,until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god
3332,LUK,22,NRSV,then he took a cup and after giving thanks he said take this and divide it among yourselves
3333,LUK,22,NRSV,for i tell you that from now on i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes
3334,LUK,22,NRSV,then he took a loaf of bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me
3335,LUK,22,NRSV,and he did the same with the cup after supper saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood
3336,LUK,22,NRSV,but see the one who betrays me is with me and his hand is on the table
3337,LUK,22,NRSV,for the son of man is going as it has been determined but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed
3338,LUK,22,NRSV,then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this
3339,LUK,22,NRSV,a dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest
3340,LUK,22,NRSV,but he said to them the kings of the gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors
3341,LUK,22,NRSV,but not so with you rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest and the leader like one who serves
3342,LUK,22,NRSV,for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves is it not the one at the table but i am among you as one who serves
3343,LUK,22,NRSV,you are those who have stood by me in my trials
3344,LUK,22,NRSV,and i confer on you just as my father has conferred on me a kingdom
3345,LUK,22,NRSV,so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
3346,LUK,22,NRSV,simon simon listen satan has demanded
3347,LUK,22,NRSV,to sift all of you like wheat
3348,LUK,22,NRSV,but i have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail and you when once you have turned back strengthen your brothers
3349,LUK,22,NRSV,and he said to him lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death
3350,LUK,22,NRSV,jesus
3351,LUK,22,NRSV,said i tell you peter the cock will not crow this day until you have denied three times that you know me
3352,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them when i sent you out without a purse bag or sandals did you lack anything they said no not a thing
3353,LUK,22,NRSV,he said to them but now the one who has a purse must take it and likewise a bag and the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one
3354,LUK,22,NRSV,for i tell you this scripture must be fulfilled in me and he was counted among the lawless and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled
3355,LUK,22,NRSV,they said lord look here are two swords he replied it is enough
3356,LUK,22,NRSV,he came out and went as was his custom to the mount of olives and the disciples followed him
3357,LUK,22,NRSV,when he reached the place he said to them pray that you may not come into the time of trial
3358,LUK,22,NRSV,then he withdrew from them about a stones throw knelt down and prayed
3359,LUK,22,NRSV,father if you are willing remove this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done
3360,LUK,22,NRSV,then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength
3361,LUK,22,NRSV,in his anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground
3362,LUK,22,NRSV,when he got up from prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief
3363,LUK,22,NRSV,and he said to them why are you sleeping get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial
3364,LUK,22,NRSV,while he was still speaking suddenly a crowd came and the one called judas one of the twelve was leading them he approached jesus to kiss him
3365,LUK,22,NRSV,but jesus said to him judas is it with a kiss that you are betraying the son of man
3366,LUK,22,NRSV,when those who were around him saw what was coming they asked lord should we strike with the sword
3367,LUK,22,NRSV,then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear
3368,LUK,22,NRSV,but jesus said no more of this and he touched his ear and healed him
3369,LUK,22,NRSV,then jesus said to the chief priests the officers of the temple police and the elders who had come for him have you come out with swords and clubs as if i were a bandit
3370,LUK,22,NRSV,when i was with you day after day in the temple you did not lay hands on me but this is your hour and the power of darkness
3371,LUK,22,NRSV,then they seized him and led him away bringing him into the high priests house but peter was following at a distance
3372,LUK,22,NRSV,when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together peter sat among them
3373,LUK,22,NRSV,then a servantgirl seeing him in the firelight stared at him and said this man also was with him
3374,LUK,22,NRSV,but he denied it saying woman i do not know him
3375,LUK,22,NRSV,a little later someone else on seeing him said you also are one of them but peter said man i am not
3376,LUK,22,NRSV,then about an hour later still another kept insisting surely this man also was with him for he is a galilean
3377,LUK,22,NRSV,but peter said man i do not know what you are talking about at that moment while he was still speaking the cock crowed
3378,LUK,22,NRSV,the lord turned and looked at peter then peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said to him before the cock crows today you will deny me three times
3379,LUK,22,NRSV,and he went out and wept bitterly
3380,LUK,22,NRSV,now the men who were holding jesus began to mock him and beat him
3381,LUK,22,NRSV,they also blindfolded him and kept asking him prophesy who is it that struck you
3382,LUK,22,NRSV,they kept heaping many other insults on him
3383,LUK,22,NRSV,when day came the assembly of the elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they brought him to their council
3384,LUK,22,NRSV,they said if you are the messiah
3385,LUK,22,NRSV,tell us he replied if i tell you you will not believe
3386,LUK,22,NRSV,and if i question you you will not answer
3387,LUK,22,NRSV,but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god
3388,LUK,22,NRSV,all of them asked are you then the son of god he said to them you say that i am
3389,LUK,22,NRSV,then they said what further testimony do we need we have heard it ourselves from his own lips
3390,LUK,23,NRSV,then the assembly rose as a body and brought jesus
3391,LUK,23,NRSV,before pilate
3392,LUK,23,NRSV,they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor and saying that he himself is the messiah a king
3393,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate asked him are you the king of the jews he answered you say so
3394,LUK,23,NRSV,then pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds i find no basis for an accusation against this man
3395,LUK,23,NRSV,but they were insistent and said he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to this place
3396,LUK,23,NRSV,when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean
3397,LUK,23,NRSV,and when he learned that he was under herods jurisdiction he sent him off to herod who was himself in jerusalem at that time
3398,LUK,23,NRSV,when herod saw jesus he was very glad for he had been wanting to see him for a long time because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign
3399,LUK,23,NRSV,he questioned him at some length but jesus
3400,LUK,23,NRSV,gave him no answer
3401,LUK,23,NRSV,the chief priests and the scribes stood by vehemently accusing him
3402,LUK,23,NRSV,even herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him then he put an elegant robe on him and sent him back to pilate
3403,LUK,23,NRSV,that same day herod and pilate became friends with each other before this they had been enemies
3404,LUK,23,NRSV,pilate then called together the chief priests the leaders and the people
3405,LUK,23,NRSV,and said to them you brought me this man as one who was perverting the people and here i have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him
3406,LUK,23,NRSV,neither has herod for he sent him back to us indeed he has done nothing to deserve death
3407,LUK,23,NRSV,i will therefore have him flogged and release him
3408,LUK,23,NRSV,then they all shouted out together away with this fellow release barabbas for us
3409,LUK,23,NRSV,this was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city and for murder
3410,LUK,23,NRSV,pilate wanting to release jesus addressed them again
3411,LUK,23,NRSV,but they kept shouting crucify crucify him
3412,LUK,23,NRSV,a third time he said to them why what evil has he done i have found in him no ground for the sentence of death i will therefore have him flogged and then release him
3413,LUK,23,NRSV,but they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified and their voices prevailed
3414,LUK,23,NRSV,so pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted
3415,LUK,23,NRSV,he released the man they asked for the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder and he handed jesus over as they wished
3416,LUK,23,NRSV,as they led him away they seized a man simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus
3417,LUK,23,NRSV,a great number of the people followed him and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him
3418,LUK,23,NRSV,but jesus turned to them and said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
3419,LUK,23,NRSV,for the days are surely coming when they will say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed
3420,LUK,23,NRSV,then they will begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us
3421,LUK,23,NRSV,for if they do this when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry
3422,LUK,23,NRSV,two others also who were criminals were led away to be put to death with him
3423,LUK,23,NRSV,when they came to the place that is called the skull they crucified jesus
3424,LUK,23,NRSV,there with the criminals one on his right and one on his left
3425,LUK,23,NRSV,then jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing
3426,LUK,23,NRSV,and they cast lots to divide his clothing
3427,LUK,23,NRSV,and the people stood by watching but the leaders scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the messiah
3428,LUK,23,NRSV,of god his chosen one
3429,LUK,23,NRSV,the soldiers also mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine
3430,LUK,23,NRSV,and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself
3431,LUK,23,NRSV,there was also an inscription over him
3432,LUK,23,NRSV,this is the king of the jews
3433,LUK,23,NRSV,one of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding
3434,LUK,23,NRSV,him and saying are you not the messiah
3435,LUK,23,NRSV,save yourself and us
3436,LUK,23,NRSV,but the other rebuked him saying do you not fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation
3437,LUK,23,NRSV,and we indeed have been condemned justly for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
3438,LUK,23,NRSV,then he said jesus remember me when you come into
3439,LUK,23,NRSV,your kingdom
3440,LUK,23,NRSV,he replied truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise
3441,LUK,23,NRSV,it was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land
3442,LUK,23,NRSV,until three in the afternoon
3443,LUK,23,NRSV,while the suns light failed
3444,LUK,23,NRSV,and the curtain of the temple was torn in two
3445,LUK,23,NRSV,then jesus crying with a loud voice said father into your hands i commend my spirit having said this he breathed his last
3446,LUK,23,NRSV,when the centurion saw what had taken place he praised god and said certainly this man was innocent
3447,LUK,23,NRSV,and when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place they returned home beating their breasts
3448,LUK,23,NRSV,but all his acquaintances including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things
3449,LUK,23,NRSV,now there was a good and righteous man named joseph who though a member of the council
3450,LUK,23,NRSV,had not agreed to their plan and action he came from the jewish town of arimathea and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of god
3451,LUK,23,NRSV,this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus
3452,LUK,23,NRSV,then he took it down wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a rockhewn tomb where no one had ever been laid
3453,LUK,23,NRSV,it was the day of preparation and the sabbath was beginning
3454,LUK,23,NRSV,the women who had come with him from galilee followed and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid
3455,LUK,23,NRSV,then they returned and prepared spices and ointments
3456,LUK,23,NRSV,on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment
3457,LUK,24,NRSV,but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb taking the spices that they had prepared
3458,LUK,24,NRSV,they found the stone rolled away from the tomb
3459,LUK,24,NRSV,but when they went in they did not find the body
3460,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were perplexed about this suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them
3461,LUK,24,NRSV,the women
3462,LUK,24,NRSV,were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground but the men
3463,LUK,24,NRSV,said to them why do you look for the living among the dead he is not here but has risen
3464,LUK,24,NRSV,remember how he told you while he was still in galilee
3465,LUK,24,NRSV,that the son of man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified and on the third day rise again
3466,LUK,24,NRSV,then they remembered his words
3467,LUK,24,NRSV,and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest
3468,LUK,24,NRSV,now it was mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the other women with them who told this to the apostles
3469,LUK,24,NRSV,but these words seemed to them an idle tale and they did not believe them
3470,LUK,24,NRSV,but peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves then he went home amazed at what had happened
3471,LUK,24,NRSV,now on that same day two of them were going to a village called emmaus about seven miles
3472,LUK,24,NRSV,from jerusalem
3473,LUK,24,NRSV,and talking with each other about all these things that had happened
3474,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking and discussing jesus himself came near and went with them
3475,LUK,24,NRSV,but their eyes were kept from recognizing him
3476,LUK,24,NRSV,and he said to them what are you discussing with each other while you walk along they stood still looking sad
3477,LUK,24,NRSV,then one of them whose name was cleopas answered him are you the only stranger in jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days
3478,LUK,24,NRSV,he asked them what things they replied the things about jesus of nazareth
3479,LUK,24,NRSV,who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
3480,LUK,24,NRSV,and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him
3481,LUK,24,NRSV,but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel
3482,LUK,24,NRSV,yes and besides all this it is now the third day since these things took place
3483,LUK,24,NRSV,moreover some women of our group astounded us they were at the tomb early this morning
3484,LUK,24,NRSV,and when they did not find his body there they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive
3485,LUK,24,NRSV,some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him
3486,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them oh how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared
3487,LUK,24,NRSV,was it not necessary that the messiah
3488,LUK,24,NRSV,should suffer these things and then enter into his glory
3489,LUK,24,NRSV,then beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures
3490,LUK,24,NRSV,as they came near the village to which they were going he walked ahead as if he were going on
3491,LUK,24,NRSV,but they urged him strongly saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over so he went in to stay with them
3492,LUK,24,NRSV,when he was at the table with them he took bread blessed and broke it and gave it to them
3493,LUK,24,NRSV,then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight
3494,LUK,24,NRSV,they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us
3495,LUK,24,NRSV,while he was talking to us on the road while he was opening the scriptures to us
3496,LUK,24,NRSV,that same hour they got up and returned to jerusalem and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together
3497,LUK,24,NRSV,they were saying the lord has risen indeed and he has appeared to simon
3498,LUK,24,NRSV,then they told what had happened on the road and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread
3499,LUK,24,NRSV,while they were talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you
3500,LUK,24,NRSV,they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost
3501,LUK,24,NRSV,he said to them why are you frightened and why do doubts arise in your hearts
3502,LUK,24,NRSV,look at my hands and my feet see that it is i myself touch me and see for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have
3503,LUK,24,NRSV,and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet
3504,LUK,24,NRSV,while in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering he said to them have you anything here to eat
3505,LUK,24,NRSV,they gave him a piece of broiled fish
3506,LUK,24,NRSV,and he took it and ate in their presence
3507,LUK,24,NRSV,then he said to them these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with youthat everything written about me in the law of moses the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled
3508,LUK,24,NRSV,then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures
3509,LUK,24,NRSV,and he said to them thus it is written that the messiah
3510,LUK,24,NRSV,is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day
3511,LUK,24,NRSV,and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations
3512,LUK,24,NRSV,beginning from jerusalem
3513,LUK,24,NRSV,you are witnesses of these things
3514,LUK,24,NRSV,and see i am sending upon you what my father promised so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high
3515,LUK,24,NRSV,then he led them out as far as bethany and lifting up his hands he blessed them
3516,LUK,24,NRSV,while he was blessing them he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven
3517,LUK,24,NRSV,and they worshiped him and
3518,LUK,24,NRSV,returned to jerusalem with great joy
3519,LUK,24,NRSV,and they were continually in the temple blessing god
3520,JHN,1,NRSV,in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
3521,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the beginning with god
3522,JHN,1,NRSV,all things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being what has come into being
3523,JHN,1,NRSV,in him was life
3524,JHN,1,NRSV,and the life was the light of all people
3525,JHN,1,NRSV,the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it
3526,JHN,1,NRSV,there was a man sent from god whose name was john
3527,JHN,1,NRSV,he came as a witness to testify to the light so that all might believe through him
3528,JHN,1,NRSV,he himself was not the light but he came to testify to the light
3529,JHN,1,NRSV,the true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world
3530,JHN,1,NRSV,he was in the world and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know him
3531,JHN,1,NRSV,he came to what was his own
3532,JHN,1,NRSV,and his own people did not accept him
3533,JHN,1,NRSV,but to all who received him who believed in his name he gave power to become children of god
3534,JHN,1,NRSV,who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god
3535,JHN,1,NRSV,and the word became flesh and lived among us and we have seen his glory the glory as of a fathers only son
3536,JHN,1,NRSV,full of grace and truth
3537,JHN,1,NRSV,john testified to him and cried out this was he of whom i said he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me
3538,JHN,1,NRSV,from his fullness we have all received grace upon grace
3539,JHN,1,NRSV,the law indeed was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ
3540,JHN,1,NRSV,no one has ever seen god it is god the only son
3541,JHN,1,NRSV,who is close to the fathers heart
3542,JHN,1,NRSV,who has made him known
3543,JHN,1,NRSV,this is the testimony given by john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who are you
3544,JHN,1,NRSV,he confessed and did not deny it but confessed i am not the messiah
3545,JHN,1,NRSV,and they asked him what then are you elijah he said i am not are you the prophet he answered no
3546,JHN,1,NRSV,then they said to him who are you let us have an answer for those who sent us what do you say about yourself
3547,JHN,1,NRSV,he said
3548,JHN,1,NRSV,i am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
3549,JHN,1,NRSV,make straight the way of the lord
3550,JHN,1,NRSV,as the prophet isaiah said
3551,JHN,1,NRSV,now they had been sent from the pharisees
3552,JHN,1,NRSV,they asked him why then are you baptizing if you are neither the messiah
3553,JHN,1,NRSV,nor elijah nor the prophet
3554,JHN,1,NRSV,john answered them i baptize with water among you stands one whom you do not know
3555,JHN,1,NRSV,the one who is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal
3556,JHN,1,NRSV,this took place in bethany across the jordan where john was baptizing
3557,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and declared here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
3558,JHN,1,NRSV,this is he of whom i said after me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me
3559,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but i came baptizing with water for this reason that he might be revealed to israel
3560,JHN,1,NRSV,and john testified i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it remained on him
3561,JHN,1,NRSV,i myself did not know him but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me he on whom you see the spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the holy spirit
3562,JHN,1,NRSV,and i myself have seen and have testified that this is the son of god
3563,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples
3564,JHN,1,NRSV,and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god
3565,JHN,1,NRSV,the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus
3566,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus turned and saw them following he said to them what are you looking for they said to him rabbi which translated means teacher where are you staying
3567,JHN,1,NRSV,he said to them come and see they came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day it was about four oclock in the afternoon
3568,JHN,1,NRSV,one of the two who heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother
3569,JHN,1,NRSV,he first found his brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated anointed
3570,JHN,1,NRSV,
3571,JHN,1,NRSV,he brought simon
3572,JHN,1,NRSV,to jesus who looked at him and said you are simon son of john you are to be called cephas which is translated peter
3573,JHN,1,NRSV,
3574,JHN,1,NRSV,the next day jesus decided to go to galilee he found philip and said to him follow me
3575,JHN,1,NRSV,now philip was from bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
3576,JHN,1,NRSV,philip found nathanael and said to him we have found him about whom moses in the law and also the prophets wrote jesus son of joseph from nazareth
3577,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael said to him can anything good come out of nazareth philip said to him come and see
3578,JHN,1,NRSV,when jesus saw nathanael coming toward him he said of him here is truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit
3579,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael asked him where did you get to know me jesus answered i saw you under the fig tree before philip called you
3580,JHN,1,NRSV,nathanael replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel
3581,JHN,1,NRSV,jesus answered do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree you will see greater things than these
3582,JHN,1,NRSV,and he said to him very truly i tell you
3583,JHN,1,NRSV,you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
3584,JHN,2,NRSV,on the third day there was a wedding in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there
3585,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding
3586,JHN,2,NRSV,when the wine gave out the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine
3587,JHN,2,NRSV,and jesus said to her woman what concern is that to you and to me my hour has not yet come
3588,JHN,2,NRSV,his mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you
3589,JHN,2,NRSV,now standing there were six stone water jars for the jewish rites of purification each holding twenty or thirty gallons
3590,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus said to them fill the jars with water and they filled them up to the brim
3591,JHN,2,NRSV,he said to them now draw some out and take it to the chief steward so they took it
3592,JHN,2,NRSV,when the steward tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it came from though the servants who had drawn the water knew the steward called the bridegroom
3593,JHN,2,NRSV,and said to him everyone serves the good wine first and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk but you have kept the good wine until now
3594,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus did this the first of his signs in cana of galilee and revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him
3595,JHN,2,NRSV,after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they remained there a few days
3596,JHN,2,NRSV,the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem
3597,JHN,2,NRSV,in the temple he found people selling cattle sheep and doves and the money changers seated at their tables
3598,JHN,2,NRSV,making a whip of cords he drove all of them out of the temple both the sheep and the cattle he also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables
3599,JHN,2,NRSV,he told those who were selling the doves take these things out of here stop making my fathers house a marketplace
3600,JHN,2,NRSV,his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me
3601,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said to him what sign can you show us for doing this
3602,JHN,2,NRSV,jesus answered them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
3603,JHN,2,NRSV,the jews then said this temple has been under construction for fortysix years and will you raise it up in three days
3604,JHN,2,NRSV,but he was speaking of the temple of his body
3605,JHN,2,NRSV,after he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word that jesus had spoken
3606,JHN,2,NRSV,when he was in jerusalem during the passover festival many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing
3607,JHN,2,NRSV,but jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them because he knew all people
3608,JHN,2,NRSV,and needed no one to testify about anyone for he himself knew what was in everyone
3609,JHN,3,NRSV,now there was a pharisee named nicodemus a leader of the jews
3610,JHN,3,NRSV,he came to jesus
3611,JHN,3,NRSV,by night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god
3612,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above
3613,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can anyone be born after having grown old can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born
3614,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit
3615,JHN,3,NRSV,what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit
3616,JHN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished that i said to you you
3617,JHN,3,NRSV,must be born from above
3618,JHN,3,NRSV,the wind
3619,JHN,3,NRSV,blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit
3620,JHN,3,NRSV,nicodemus said to him how can these things be
3621,JHN,3,NRSV,jesus answered him are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things
3622,JHN,3,NRSV,very truly i tell you we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen yet you
3623,JHN,3,NRSV,do not receive our testimony
3624,JHN,3,NRSV,if i have told you about earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if i tell you about heavenly things
3625,JHN,3,NRSV,no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven the son of man
3626,JHN,3,NRSV,and just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up
3627,JHN,3,NRSV,that whoever believes in him may have eternal life
3628,JHN,3,NRSV,for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life
3629,JHN,3,NRSV,indeed god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him
3630,JHN,3,NRSV,those who believe in him are not condemned but those who do not believe are condemned already because they have not believed in the name of the only son of god
3631,JHN,3,NRSV,and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil
3632,JHN,3,NRSV,for all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light so that their deeds may not be exposed
3633,JHN,3,NRSV,but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god
3634,JHN,3,NRSV,after this jesus and his disciples went into the judean countryside and he spent some time there with them and baptized
3635,JHN,3,NRSV,john also was baptizing at aenon near salim because water was abundant there and people kept coming and were being baptized
3636,JHN,3,NRSV,john of course had not yet been thrown into prison
3637,JHN,3,NRSV,now a discussion about purification arose between johns disciples and a jew
3638,JHN,3,NRSV,they came to john and said to him rabbi the one who was with you across the jordan to whom you testified here he is baptizing and all are going to him
3639,JHN,3,NRSV,john answered no one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven
3640,JHN,3,NRSV,you yourselves are my witnesses that i said i am not the messiah
3641,JHN,3,NRSV,but i have been sent ahead of him
3642,JHN,3,NRSV,he who has the bride is the bridegroom the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegrooms voice for this reason my joy has been fulfilled
3643,JHN,3,NRSV,he must increase but i must decrease
3644,JHN,3,NRSV,the one who comes from above is above all the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things the one who comes from heaven is above all
3645,JHN,3,NRSV,he testifies to what he has seen and heard yet no one accepts his testimony
3646,JHN,3,NRSV,whoever has accepted his testimony has certified
3647,JHN,3,NRSV,this that god is true
3648,JHN,3,NRSV,he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he gives the spirit without measure
3649,JHN,3,NRSV,the father loves the son and has placed all things in his hands
3650,JHN,3,NRSV,whoever believes in the son has eternal life whoever disobeys the son will not see life but must endure gods wrath
3651,JHN,4,NRSV,now when jesus
3652,JHN,4,NRSV,learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john
3653,JHN,4,NRSV,although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized
3654,JHN,4,NRSV,he left judea and started back to galilee
3655,JHN,4,NRSV,but he had to go through samaria
3656,JHN,4,NRSV,so he came to a samaritan city called sychar near the plot of ground that jacob had given to his son joseph
3657,JHN,4,NRSV,jacobs well was there and jesus tired out by his journey was sitting by the well it was about noon
3658,JHN,4,NRSV,a samaritan woman came to draw water and jesus said to her give me a drink
3659,JHN,4,NRSV,his disciples had gone to the city to buy food
3660,JHN,4,NRSV,the samaritan woman said to him how is it that you a jew ask a drink of me a woman of samaria jews do not share things in common with samaritans
3661,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus answered her if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
3662,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir you have no bucket and the well is deep where do you get that living water
3663,JHN,4,NRSV,are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it
3664,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again
3665,JHN,4,NRSV,but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty the water that i will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life
3666,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water
3667,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her go call your husband and come back
3668,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman answered him i have no husband jesus said to her you are right in saying i have no husband
3669,JHN,4,NRSV,for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband what you have said is true
3670,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet
3671,JHN,4,NRSV,our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you
3672,JHN,4,NRSV,say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem
3673,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem
3674,JHN,4,NRSV,you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews
3675,JHN,4,NRSV,but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him
3676,JHN,4,NRSV,god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
3677,JHN,4,NRSV,the woman said to him i know that messiah is coming who is called christ when he comes he will proclaim all things to us
3678,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to her i am he
3679,JHN,4,NRSV,the one who is speaking to you
3680,JHN,4,NRSV,just then his disciples came they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman but no one said what do you want or why are you speaking with her
3681,JHN,4,NRSV,then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city she said to the people
3682,JHN,4,NRSV,come and see a man who told me everything i have ever done he cannot be the messiah
3683,JHN,4,NRSV,can he
3684,JHN,4,NRSV,they left the city and were on their way to him
3685,JHN,4,NRSV,meanwhile the disciples were urging him rabbi eat something
3686,JHN,4,NRSV,but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about
3687,JHN,4,NRSV,so the disciples said to one another surely no one has brought him something to eat
3688,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work
3689,JHN,4,NRSV,do you not say four months more then comes the harvest but i tell you look around you and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting
3690,JHN,4,NRSV,the reaper is already receiving
3691,JHN,4,NRSV,wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together
3692,JHN,4,NRSV,for here the saying holds true one sows and another reaps
3693,JHN,4,NRSV,i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor
3694,JHN,4,NRSV,many samaritans from that city believed in him because of the womans testimony he told me everything i have ever done
3695,JHN,4,NRSV,so when the samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days
3696,JHN,4,NRSV,and many more believed because of his word
3697,JHN,4,NRSV,they said to the woman it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this is truly the savior of the world
3698,JHN,4,NRSV,when the two days were over he went from that place to galilee
3699,JHN,4,NRSV,for jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophets own country
3700,JHN,4,NRSV,when he came to galilee the galileans welcomed him since they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival
3701,JHN,4,NRSV,then he came again to cana in galilee where he had changed the water into wine now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in capernaum
3702,JHN,4,NRSV,when he heard that jesus had come from judea to galilee he went and begged him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death
3703,JHN,4,NRSV,then jesus said to him unless you
3704,JHN,4,NRSV,see signs and wonders you will not believe
3705,JHN,4,NRSV,the official said to him sir come down before my little boy dies
3706,JHN,4,NRSV,jesus said to him go your son will live the man believed the word that jesus spoke to him and started on his way
3707,JHN,4,NRSV,as he was going down his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive
3708,JHN,4,NRSV,so he asked them the hour when he began to recover and they said to him yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him
3709,JHN,4,NRSV,the father realized that this was the hour when jesus had said to him your son will live so he himself believed along with his whole household
3710,JHN,4,NRSV,now this was the second sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee
3711,JHN,5,NRSV,after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
3712,JHN,5,NRSV,now in jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool called in hebrew
3713,JHN,5,NRSV,bethzatha
3714,JHN,5,NRSV,which has five porticoes
3715,JHN,5,NRSV,in these lay many invalidsblind lame and paralyzed
3716,JHN,5,NRSV,one man was there who had been ill for thirtyeight years
3717,JHN,5,NRSV,when jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be made well
3718,JHN,5,NRSV,the sick man answered him sir i have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up and while i am making my way someone else steps down ahead of me
3719,JHN,5,NRSV,jesus said to him stand up take your mat and walk
3720,JHN,5,NRSV,at once the man was made well and he took up his mat and began to walk
3721,JHN,5,NRSV,now that day was a sabbath
3722,JHN,5,NRSV,so the jews said to the man who had been cured it is the sabbath it is not lawful for you to carry your mat
3723,JHN,5,NRSV,but he answered them the man who made me well said to me take up your mat and walk
3724,JHN,5,NRSV,they asked him who is the man who said to you take it up and walk
3725,JHN,5,NRSV,now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for jesus had disappeared in
3726,JHN,5,NRSV,the crowd that was there
3727,JHN,5,NRSV,later jesus found him in the temple and said to him see you have been made well do not sin any more so that nothing worse happens to you
3728,JHN,5,NRSV,the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well
3729,JHN,5,NRSV,therefore the jews started persecuting jesus because he was doing such things on the sabbath
3730,JHN,5,NRSV,but jesus answered them my father is still working and i also am working
3731,JHN,5,NRSV,for this reason the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he was not only breaking the sabbath but was also calling god his own father thereby making himself equal to god
3732,JHN,5,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you the son can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father
3733,JHN,5,NRSV,does the son does likewise
3734,JHN,5,NRSV,the father loves the son and shows him all that he himself is doing and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be astonished
3735,JHN,5,NRSV,indeed just as the father raises the dead and gives them life so also the son gives life to whomever he wishes
3736,JHN,5,NRSV,the father judges no one but has given all judgment to the son
3737,JHN,5,NRSV,so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father anyone who does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him
3738,JHN,5,NRSV,very truly i tell you anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment but has passed from death to life
3739,JHN,5,NRSV,very truly i tell you the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live
3740,JHN,5,NRSV,for just as the father has life in himself so he has granted the son also to have life in himself
3741,JHN,5,NRSV,and he has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the son of man
3742,JHN,5,NRSV,do not be astonished at this for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
3743,JHN,5,NRSV,and will come outthose who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation
3744,JHN,5,NRSV,i can do nothing on my own as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me
3745,JHN,5,NRSV,if i testify about myself my testimony is not true
3746,JHN,5,NRSV,there is another who testifies on my behalf and i know that his testimony to me is true
3747,JHN,5,NRSV,you sent messengers to john and he testified to the truth
3748,JHN,5,NRSV,not that i accept such human testimony but i say these things so that you may be saved
3749,JHN,5,NRSV,he was a burning and shining lamp and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light
3750,JHN,5,NRSV,but i have a testimony greater than johns the works that the father has given me to complete the very works that i am doing testify on my behalf that the father has sent me
3751,JHN,5,NRSV,and the father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf you have never heard his voice or seen his form
3752,JHN,5,NRSV,and you do not have his word abiding in you because you do not believe him whom he has sent
3753,JHN,5,NRSV,you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is they that testify on my behalf
3754,JHN,5,NRSV,yet you refuse to come to me to have life
3755,JHN,5,NRSV,i do not accept glory from human beings
3756,JHN,5,NRSV,but i know that you do not have the love of god in
3757,JHN,5,NRSV,you
3758,JHN,5,NRSV,i have come in my fathers name and you do not accept me if another comes in his own name you will accept him
3759,JHN,5,NRSV,how can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is god
3760,JHN,5,NRSV,do not think that i will accuse you before the father your accuser is moses on whom you have set your hope
3761,JHN,5,NRSV,if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me
3762,JHN,5,NRSV,but if you do not believe what he wrote how will you believe what i say
3763,JHN,6,NRSV,after this jesus went to the other side of the sea of galilee also called the sea of tiberias
3764,JHN,6,NRSV,a large crowd kept following him because they saw the signs that he was doing for the sick
3765,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus went up the mountain and sat down there with his disciples
3766,JHN,6,NRSV,now the passover the festival of the jews was near
3767,JHN,6,NRSV,when he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him jesus said to philip where are we to buy bread for these people to eat
3768,JHN,6,NRSV,he said this to test him for he himself knew what he was going to do
3769,JHN,6,NRSV,philip answered him six months wages
3770,JHN,6,NRSV,would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little
3771,JHN,6,NRSV,one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother said to him
3772,JHN,6,NRSV,there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish but what are they among so many people
3773,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus said make the people sit down now there was a great deal of grass in the place so they
3774,JHN,6,NRSV,sat down about five thousand in all
3775,JHN,6,NRSV,then jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so also the fish as much as they wanted
3776,JHN,6,NRSV,when they were satisfied he told his disciples gather up the fragments left over so that nothing may be lost
3777,JHN,6,NRSV,so they gathered them up and from the fragments of the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten they filled twelve baskets
3778,JHN,6,NRSV,when the people saw the sign that he had done they began to say this is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world
3779,JHN,6,NRSV,when jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king he withdrew again to the mountain by himself
3780,JHN,6,NRSV,when evening came his disciples went down to the sea
3781,JHN,6,NRSV,got into a boat and started across the sea to capernaum it was now dark and jesus had not yet come to them
3782,JHN,6,NRSV,the sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing
3783,JHN,6,NRSV,when they had rowed about three or four miles
3784,JHN,6,NRSV,they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were terrified
3785,JHN,6,NRSV,but he said to them it is i
3786,JHN,6,NRSV,do not be afraid
3787,JHN,6,NRSV,then they wanted to take him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going
3788,JHN,6,NRSV,the next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there they also saw that jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone
3789,JHN,6,NRSV,then some boats from tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the lord had given thanks
3790,JHN,6,NRSV,so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus
3791,JHN,6,NRSV,when they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him rabbi when did you come here
3792,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves
3793,JHN,6,NRSV,do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the son of man will give you for it is on him that god the father has set his seal
3794,JHN,6,NRSV,then they said to him what must we do to perform the works of god
3795,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent
3796,JHN,6,NRSV,so they said to him what sign are you going to give us then so that we may see it and believe you what work are you performing
3797,JHN,6,NRSV,our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
3798,JHN,6,NRSV,then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven
3799,JHN,6,NRSV,for the bread of god is that which
3800,JHN,6,NRSV,comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
3801,JHN,6,NRSV,they said to him sir give us this bread always
3802,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus said to them i am the bread of life whoever comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty
3803,JHN,6,NRSV,but i said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe
3804,JHN,6,NRSV,everything that the father gives me will come to me and anyone who comes to me i will never drive away
3805,JHN,6,NRSV,for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me
3806,JHN,6,NRSV,and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day
3807,JHN,6,NRSV,this is indeed the will of my father that all who see the son and believe in him may have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day
3808,JHN,6,NRSV,then the jews began to complain about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven
3809,JHN,6,NRSV,they were saying is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how can he now say i have come down from heaven
3810,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them do not complain among yourselves
3811,JHN,6,NRSV,no one can come to me unless drawn by the father who sent me and i will raise that person up on the last day
3812,JHN,6,NRSV,it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught by god everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me
3813,JHN,6,NRSV,not that anyone has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father
3814,JHN,6,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever believes has eternal life
3815,JHN,6,NRSV,i am the bread of life
3816,JHN,6,NRSV,your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and they died
3817,JHN,6,NRSV,this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat of it and not die
3818,JHN,6,NRSV,i am the living bread that came down from heaven whoever eats of this bread will live forever and the bread that i will give for the life of the world is my flesh
3819,JHN,6,NRSV,the jews then disputed among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat
3820,JHN,6,NRSV,so jesus said to them very truly i tell you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you
3821,JHN,6,NRSV,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life and i will raise them up on the last day
3822,JHN,6,NRSV,for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
3823,JHN,6,NRSV,those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me and i in them
3824,JHN,6,NRSV,just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so whoever eats me will live because of me
3825,JHN,6,NRSV,this is the bread that came down from heaven not like that which your ancestors ate and they died but the one who eats this bread will live forever
3826,JHN,6,NRSV,he said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at capernaum
3827,JHN,6,NRSV,when many of his disciples heard it they said this teaching is difficult who can accept it
3828,JHN,6,NRSV,but jesus being aware that his disciples were complaining about it said to them does this offend you
3829,JHN,6,NRSV,then what if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before
3830,JHN,6,NRSV,it is the spirit that gives life the flesh is useless the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life
3831,JHN,6,NRSV,but among you there are some who do not believe for jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe and who was the one that would betray him
3832,JHN,6,NRSV,and he said for this reason i have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the father
3833,JHN,6,NRSV,because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him
3834,JHN,6,NRSV,so jesus asked the twelve do you also wish to go away
3835,JHN,6,NRSV,simon peter answered him lord to whom can we go you have the words of eternal life
3836,JHN,6,NRSV,we have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of god
3837,JHN,6,NRSV,jesus answered them did i not choose you the twelve yet one of you is a devil
3838,JHN,6,NRSV,he was speaking of judas son of simon iscariot
3839,JHN,6,NRSV,for he though one of the twelve was going to betray him
3840,JHN,7,NRSV,after this jesus went about in galilee he did not wish
3841,JHN,7,NRSV,to go about in judea because the jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him
3842,JHN,7,NRSV,now the jewish festival of booths
3843,JHN,7,NRSV,was near
3844,JHN,7,NRSV,so his brothers said to him leave here and go to judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing
3845,JHN,7,NRSV,for no one who wants
3846,JHN,7,NRSV,to be widely known acts in secret if you do these things show yourself to the world
3847,JHN,7,NRSV,for not even his brothers believed in him
3848,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus said to them my time has not yet come but your time is always here
3849,JHN,7,NRSV,the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil
3850,JHN,7,NRSV,go to the festival yourselves i am not
3851,JHN,7,NRSV,going to this festival for my time has not yet fully come
3852,JHN,7,NRSV,after saying this he remained in galilee
3853,JHN,7,NRSV,but after his brothers had gone to the festival then he also went not publicly but as it were
3854,JHN,7,NRSV,in secret
3855,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were looking for him at the festival and saying where is he
3856,JHN,7,NRSV,and there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds while some were saying he is a good man others were saying no he is deceiving the crowd
3857,JHN,7,NRSV,yet no one would speak openly about him for fear of the jews
3858,JHN,7,NRSV,about the middle of the festival jesus went up into the temple and began to teach
3859,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews were astonished at it saying how does this man have such learning
3860,JHN,7,NRSV,when he has never been taught
3861,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus answered them my teaching is not mine but his who sent me
3862,JHN,7,NRSV,anyone who resolves to do the will of god will know whether the teaching is from god or whether i am speaking on my own
3863,JHN,7,NRSV,those who speak on their own seek their own glory but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true and there is nothing false in him
3864,JHN,7,NRSV,did not moses give you the law yet none of you keeps the law why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me
3865,JHN,7,NRSV,the crowd answered you have a demon who is trying to kill you
3866,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus answered them i performed one work and all of you are astonished
3867,JHN,7,NRSV,moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath
3868,JHN,7,NRSV,if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of moses may not be broken are you angry with me because i healed a mans whole body on the sabbath
3869,JHN,7,NRSV,do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment
3870,JHN,7,NRSV,now some of the people of jerusalem were saying is not this the man whom they are trying to kill
3871,JHN,7,NRSV,and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah
3872,JHN,7,NRSV,yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah
3873,JHN,7,NRSV,comes no one will know where he is from
3874,JHN,7,NRSV,then jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple you know me and you know where i am from i have not come on my own but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him
3875,JHN,7,NRSV,i know him because i am from him and he sent me
3876,JHN,7,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him but no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come
3877,JHN,7,NRSV,yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying when the messiah
3878,JHN,7,NRSV,comes will he do more signs than this man has done
3879,JHN,7,NRSV,the pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him and the chief priests and pharisees sent temple police to arrest him
3880,JHN,7,NRSV,jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me
3881,JHN,7,NRSV,you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
3882,JHN,7,NRSV,the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we will not find him does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks
3883,JHN,7,NRSV,what does he mean by saying you will search for me and you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
3884,JHN,7,NRSV,on the last day of the festival the great day while jesus was standing there he cried out let anyone who is thirsty come to me
3885,JHN,7,NRSV,and let the one who believes in me drink as
3886,JHN,7,NRSV,the scripture has said out of the believers heart
3887,JHN,7,NRSV,shall flow rivers of living water
3888,JHN,7,NRSV,now he said this about the spirit which believers in him were to receive for as yet there was no spirit
3889,JHN,7,NRSV,because jesus was not yet glorified
3890,JHN,7,NRSV,when they heard these words some in the crowd said this is really the prophet
3891,JHN,7,NRSV,others said this is the messiah
3892,JHN,7,NRSV,but some asked surely the messiah
3893,JHN,7,NRSV,does not come from galilee does he
3894,JHN,7,NRSV,has not the scripture said that the messiah
3895,JHN,7,NRSV,is descended from david and comes from bethlehem the village where david lived
3896,JHN,7,NRSV,so there was a division in the crowd because of him
3897,JHN,7,NRSV,some of them wanted to arrest him but no one laid hands on him
3898,JHN,7,NRSV,then the temple police went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why did you not arrest him
3899,JHN,7,NRSV,the police answered never has anyone spoken like this
3900,JHN,7,NRSV,then the pharisees replied surely you have not been deceived too have you
3901,JHN,7,NRSV,has any one of the authorities or of the pharisees believed in him
3902,JHN,7,NRSV,but this crowd which does not know the lawthey are accursed
3903,JHN,7,NRSV,nicodemus who had gone to jesus
3904,JHN,7,NRSV,before and who was one of them asked
3905,JHN,7,NRSV,our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing does it
3906,JHN,7,NRSV,they replied surely you are not also from galilee are you search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from galilee
3907,JHN,7,NRSV,
3908,JHN,7,NRSV,then each of them went home
3909,JHN,8,NRSV,while jesus went to the mount of olives
3910,JHN,8,NRSV,early in the morning he came again to the temple all the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them
3911,JHN,8,NRSV,the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and making her stand before all of them
3912,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him teacher this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery
3913,JHN,8,NRSV,now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women now what do you say
3914,JHN,8,NRSV,they said this to test him so that they might have some charge to bring against him jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground
3915,JHN,8,NRSV,when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her
3916,JHN,8,NRSV,and once again he bent down and wrote on the ground
3917,JHN,8,NRSV,when they heard it they went away one by one beginning with the elders and jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him
3918,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus straightened up and said to her woman where are they has no one condemned you
3919,JHN,8,NRSV,she said no one sir
3920,JHN,8,NRSV,and jesus said neither do i condemn you go your way and from now on do not sin again
3921,JHN,8,NRSV,again jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life
3922,JHN,8,NRSV,then the pharisees said to him you are testifying on your own behalf your testimony is not valid
3923,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid because i know where i have come from and where i am going but you do not know where i come from or where i am going
3924,JHN,8,NRSV,you judge by human standards
3925,JHN,8,NRSV,i judge no one
3926,JHN,8,NRSV,yet even if i do judge my judgment is valid for it is not i alone who judge but i and the father
3927,JHN,8,NRSV,who sent me
3928,JHN,8,NRSV,in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid
3929,JHN,8,NRSV,i testify on my own behalf and the father who sent me testifies on my behalf
3930,JHN,8,NRSV,then they said to him where is your father jesus answered you know neither me nor my father if you knew me you would know my father also
3931,JHN,8,NRSV,he spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple but no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come
3932,JHN,8,NRSV,again he said to them i am going away and you will search for me but you will die in your sin where i am going you cannot come
3933,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said is he going to kill himself is that what he means by saying where i am going you cannot come
3934,JHN,8,NRSV,he said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world
3935,JHN,8,NRSV,i told you that you would die in your sins for you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he
3936,JHN,8,NRSV,they said to him who are you jesus said to them why do i speak to you at all
3937,JHN,8,NRSV,i have much to say about you and much to condemn but the one who sent me is true and i declare to the world what i have heard from him
3938,JHN,8,NRSV,they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father
3939,JHN,8,NRSV,so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will realize that i am he
3940,JHN,8,NRSV,and that i do nothing on my own but i speak these things as the father instructed me
3941,JHN,8,NRSV,and the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what is pleasing to him
3942,JHN,8,NRSV,as he was saying these things many believed in him
3943,JHN,8,NRSV,then jesus said to the jews who had believed in him if you continue in my word you are truly my disciples
3944,JHN,8,NRSV,and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free
3945,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves to anyone what do you mean by saying you will be made free
3946,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered them very truly i tell you everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin
3947,JHN,8,NRSV,the slave does not have a permanent place in the household the son has a place there forever
3948,JHN,8,NRSV,so if the son makes you free you will be free indeed
3949,JHN,8,NRSV,i know that you are descendants of abraham yet you look for an opportunity to kill me because there is no place in you for my word
3950,JHN,8,NRSV,i declare what i have seen in the fathers presence as for you you should do what you have heard from the father
3951,JHN,8,NRSV,they answered him abraham is our father jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing
3952,JHN,8,NRSV,what abraham did
3953,JHN,8,NRSV,but now you are trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god this is not what abraham did
3954,JHN,8,NRSV,you are indeed doing what your father does they said to him we are not illegitimate children we have one father god himself
3955,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now i am here i did not come on my own but he sent me
3956,JHN,8,NRSV,why do you not understand what i say it is because you cannot accept my word
3957,JHN,8,NRSV,you are from your father the devil and you choose to do your fathers desires he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies
3958,JHN,8,NRSV,but because i tell the truth you do not believe me
3959,JHN,8,NRSV,which of you convicts me of sin if i tell the truth why do you not believe me
3960,JHN,8,NRSV,whoever is from god hears the words of god the reason you do not hear them is that you are not from god
3961,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews answered him are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan and have a demon
3962,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me
3963,JHN,8,NRSV,yet i do not seek my own glory there is one who seeks it and he is the judge
3964,JHN,8,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever keeps my word will never see death
3965,JHN,8,NRSV,the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say whoever keeps my word will never taste death
3966,JHN,8,NRSV,are you greater than our father abraham who died the prophets also died who do you claim to be
3967,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing it is my father who glorifies me he of whom you say he is our god
3968,JHN,8,NRSV,though you do not know him but i know him if i would say that i do not know him i would be a liar like you but i do know him and i keep his word
3969,JHN,8,NRSV,your ancestor abraham rejoiced that he would see my day he saw it and was glad
3970,JHN,8,NRSV,then the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham
3971,JHN,8,NRSV,jesus said to them very truly i tell you before abraham was i am
3972,JHN,8,NRSV,so they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple
3973,JHN,9,NRSV,as he walked along he saw a man blind from birth
3974,JHN,9,NRSV,his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind
3975,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus answered neither this man nor his parents sinned he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him
3976,JHN,9,NRSV,we
3977,JHN,9,NRSV,must work the works of him who sent me
3978,JHN,9,NRSV,while it is day night is coming when no one can work
3979,JHN,9,NRSV,as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
3980,JHN,9,NRSV,when he had said this he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the mans eyes
3981,JHN,9,NRSV,saying to him go wash in the pool of siloam which means sent then he went and washed and came back able to see
3982,JHN,9,NRSV,the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask is this not the man who used to sit and beg
3983,JHN,9,NRSV,some were saying it is he others were saying no but it is someone like him he kept saying i am the man
3984,JHN,9,NRSV,but they kept asking him then how were your eyes opened
3985,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash then i went and washed and received my sight
3986,JHN,9,NRSV,they said to him where is he he said i do not know
3987,JHN,9,NRSV,they brought to the pharisees the man who had formerly been blind
3988,JHN,9,NRSV,now it was a sabbath day when jesus made the mud and opened his eyes
3989,JHN,9,NRSV,then the pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight he said to them he put mud on my eyes then i washed and now i see
3990,JHN,9,NRSV,some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath but others said how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs and they were divided
3991,JHN,9,NRSV,so they said again to the blind man what do you say about him it was your eyes he opened he said he is a prophet
3992,JHN,9,NRSV,the jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
3993,JHN,9,NRSV,and asked them is this your son who you say was born blind how then does he now see
3994,JHN,9,NRSV,his parents answered we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
3995,JHN,9,NRSV,but we do not know how it is that now he sees nor do we know who opened his eyes ask him he is of age he will speak for himself
3996,JHN,9,NRSV,his parents said this because they were afraid of the jews for the jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed jesus
3997,JHN,9,NRSV,to be the messiah
3998,JHN,9,NRSV,would be put out of the synagogue
3999,JHN,9,NRSV,therefore his parents said he is of age ask him
4000,JHN,9,NRSV,so for the second time they called the man who had been blind and they said to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner
4001,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered i do not know whether he is a sinner one thing i do know that though i was blind now i see
4002,JHN,9,NRSV,they said to him what did he do to you how did he open your eyes
4003,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered them i have told you already and you would not listen why do you want to hear it again do you also want to become his disciples
4004,JHN,9,NRSV,then they reviled him saying you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses
4005,JHN,9,NRSV,we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from
4006,JHN,9,NRSV,the man answered here is an astonishing thing you do not know where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes
4007,JHN,9,NRSV,we know that god does not listen to sinners but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will
4008,JHN,9,NRSV,never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind
4009,JHN,9,NRSV,if this man were not from god he could do nothing
4010,JHN,9,NRSV,they answered him you were born entirely in sins and are you trying to teach us and they drove him out
4011,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus heard that they had driven him out and when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man
4012,JHN,9,NRSV,he answered and who is he sir
4013,JHN,9,NRSV,tell me so that i may believe in him
4014,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said to him you have seen him and the one speaking with you is he
4015,JHN,9,NRSV,he said lord
4016,JHN,9,NRSV,i believe and he worshiped him
4017,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind
4018,JHN,9,NRSV,some of the pharisees near him heard this and said to him surely we are not blind are we
4019,JHN,9,NRSV,jesus said to them if you were blind you would not have sin but now that you say we see your sin remains
4020,JHN,10,NRSV,very truly i tell you anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit
4021,JHN,10,NRSV,the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep
4022,JHN,10,NRSV,the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep hear his voice he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
4023,JHN,10,NRSV,when he has brought out all his own he goes ahead of them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice
4024,JHN,10,NRSV,they will not follow a stranger but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers
4025,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus used this figure of speech with them but they did not understand what he was saying to them
4026,JHN,10,NRSV,so again jesus said to them very truly i tell you i am the gate for the sheep
4027,JHN,10,NRSV,all who came before me are thieves and bandits but the sheep did not listen to them
4028,JHN,10,NRSV,i am the gate whoever enters by me will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture
4029,JHN,10,NRSV,the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy i came that they may have life and have it abundantly
4030,JHN,10,NRSV,i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
4031,JHN,10,NRSV,the hired hand who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs awayand the wolf snatches them and scatters them
4032,JHN,10,NRSV,the hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep
4033,JHN,10,NRSV,i am the good shepherd i know my own and my own know me
4034,JHN,10,NRSV,just as the father knows me and i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
4035,JHN,10,NRSV,i have other sheep that do not belong to this fold i must bring them also and they will listen to my voice so there will be one flock one shepherd
4036,JHN,10,NRSV,for this reason the father loves me because i lay down my life in order to take it up again
4037,JHN,10,NRSV,no one takes
4038,JHN,10,NRSV,it from me but i lay it down of my own accord i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again i have received this command from my father
4039,JHN,10,NRSV,again the jews were divided because of these words
4040,JHN,10,NRSV,many of them were saying he has a demon and is out of his mind why listen to him
4041,JHN,10,NRSV,others were saying these are not the words of one who has a demon can a demon open the eyes of the blind
4042,JHN,10,NRSV,at that time the festival of the dedication took place in jerusalem it was winter
4043,JHN,10,NRSV,and jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of solomon
4044,JHN,10,NRSV,so the jews gathered around him and said to him how long will you keep us in suspense if you are the messiah
4045,JHN,10,NRSV,tell us plainly
4046,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus answered i have told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name testify to me
4047,JHN,10,NRSV,but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep
4048,JHN,10,NRSV,my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me
4049,JHN,10,NRSV,i give them eternal life and they will never perish no one will snatch them out of my hand
4050,JHN,10,NRSV,what my father has given me is greater than all else and no one can snatch it out of the fathers hand
4051,JHN,10,NRSV,the father and i are one
4052,JHN,10,NRSV,the jews took up stones again to stone him
4053,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus replied i have shown you many good works from the father for which of these are you going to stone me
4054,JHN,10,NRSV,the jews answered it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you though only a human being are making yourself god
4055,JHN,10,NRSV,jesus answered is it not written in your law
4056,JHN,10,NRSV,i said you are gods
4057,JHN,10,NRSV,if those to whom the word of god came were called godsand the scripture cannot be annulled
4058,JHN,10,NRSV,can you say that the one whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because i said i am gods son
4059,JHN,10,NRSV,if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me
4060,JHN,10,NRSV,but if i do them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may know and understand
4061,JHN,10,NRSV,that the father is in me and i am in the father
4062,JHN,10,NRSV,then they tried to arrest him again but he escaped from their hands
4063,JHN,10,NRSV,he went away again across the jordan to the place where john had been baptizing earlier and he remained there
4064,JHN,10,NRSV,many came to him and they were saying john performed no sign but everything that john said about this man was true
4065,JHN,10,NRSV,and many believed in him there
4066,JHN,11,NRSV,now a certain man was ill lazarus of bethany the village of mary and her sister martha
4067,JHN,11,NRSV,mary was the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair her brother lazarus was ill
4068,JHN,11,NRSV,so the sisters sent a message to jesus
4069,JHN,11,NRSV,lord he whom you love is ill
4070,JHN,11,NRSV,but when jesus heard it he said this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory so that the son of god may be glorified through it
4071,JHN,11,NRSV,accordingly though jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus
4072,JHN,11,NRSV,after having heard that lazarus
4073,JHN,11,NRSV,was ill he stayed two days longer in the place where he was
4074,JHN,11,NRSV,then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again
4075,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him rabbi the jews were just now trying to stone you and are you going there again
4076,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight those who walk during the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world
4077,JHN,11,NRSV,but those who walk at night stumble because the light is not in them
4078,JHN,11,NRSV,after saying this he told them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him
4079,JHN,11,NRSV,the disciples said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will be all right
4080,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus however had been speaking about his death but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep
4081,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus told them plainly lazarus is dead
4082,JHN,11,NRSV,for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him
4083,JHN,11,NRSV,thomas who was called the twin
4084,JHN,11,NRSV,said to his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him
4085,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus arrived he found that lazarus
4086,JHN,11,NRSV,had already been in the tomb four days
4087,JHN,11,NRSV,now bethany was near jerusalem some two miles
4088,JHN,11,NRSV,away
4089,JHN,11,NRSV,and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them about their brother
4090,JHN,11,NRSV,when martha heard that jesus was coming she went and met him while mary stayed at home
4091,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
4092,JHN,11,NRSV,but even now i know that god will give you whatever you ask of him
4093,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her your brother will rise again
4094,JHN,11,NRSV,martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day
4095,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life
4096,JHN,11,NRSV,those who believe in me even though they die will live
4097,JHN,11,NRSV,and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die do you believe this
4098,JHN,11,NRSV,she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the messiah
4099,JHN,11,NRSV,the son of god the one coming into the world
4100,JHN,11,NRSV,when she had said this she went back and called her sister mary and told her privately the teacher is here and is calling for you
4101,JHN,11,NRSV,and when she heard it she got up quickly and went to him
4102,JHN,11,NRSV,now jesus had not yet come to the village but was still at the place where martha had met him
4103,JHN,11,NRSV,the jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw mary get up quickly and go out they followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there
4104,JHN,11,NRSV,when mary came where jesus was and saw him she knelt at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
4105,JHN,11,NRSV,when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved
4106,JHN,11,NRSV,he said where have you laid him they said to him lord come and see
4107,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus began to weep
4108,JHN,11,NRSV,so the jews said see how he loved him
4109,JHN,11,NRSV,but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying
4110,JHN,11,NRSV,then jesus again greatly disturbed came to the tomb it was a cave and a stone was lying against it
4111,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said take away the stone martha the sister of the dead man said to him lord already there is a stench because he has been dead four days
4112,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god
4113,JHN,11,NRSV,so they took away the stone and jesus looked upward and said father i thank you for having heard me
4114,JHN,11,NRSV,i knew that you always hear me but i have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me
4115,JHN,11,NRSV,when he had said this he cried with a loud voice lazarus come out
4116,JHN,11,NRSV,the dead man came out his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth jesus said to them unbind him and let him go
4117,JHN,11,NRSV,many of the jews therefore who had come with mary and had seen what jesus did believed in him
4118,JHN,11,NRSV,but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what he had done
4119,JHN,11,NRSV,so the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the council and said what are we to do this man is performing many signs
4120,JHN,11,NRSV,if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place
4121,JHN,11,NRSV,and our nation
4122,JHN,11,NRSV,but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all
4123,JHN,11,NRSV,you do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed
4124,JHN,11,NRSV,he did not say this on his own but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus was about to die for the nation
4125,JHN,11,NRSV,and not for the nation only but to gather into one the dispersed children of god
4126,JHN,11,NRSV,so from that day on they planned to put him to death
4127,JHN,11,NRSV,jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the jews but went from there to a town called ephraim in the region near the wilderness and he remained there with the disciples
4128,JHN,11,NRSV,now the passover of the jews was near and many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves
4129,JHN,11,NRSV,they were looking for jesus and were asking one another as they stood in the temple what do you think surely he will not come to the festival will he
4130,JHN,11,NRSV,now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where jesus
4131,JHN,11,NRSV,was should let them know so that they might arrest him
4132,JHN,12,NRSV,six days before the passover jesus came to bethany the home of lazarus whom he had raised from the dead
4133,JHN,12,NRSV,there they gave a dinner for him martha served and lazarus was one of those at the table with him
4134,JHN,12,NRSV,mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard anointed jesus feet and wiped them
4135,JHN,12,NRSV,with her hair the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume
4136,JHN,12,NRSV,but judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said
4137,JHN,12,NRSV,why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii
4138,JHN,12,NRSV,and the money given to the poor
4139,JHN,12,NRSV,he said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it
4140,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus said leave her alone she bought it
4141,JHN,12,NRSV,so that she might keep it for the day of my burial
4142,JHN,12,NRSV,you always have the poor with you but you do not always have me
4143,JHN,12,NRSV,when the great crowd of the jews learned that he was there they came not only because of jesus but also to see lazarus whom he had raised from the dead
4144,JHN,12,NRSV,so the chief priests planned to put lazarus to death as well
4145,JHN,12,NRSV,since it was on account of him that many of the jews were deserting and were believing in jesus
4146,JHN,12,NRSV,the next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
4147,JHN,12,NRSV,so they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him shouting
4148,JHN,12,NRSV,hosanna
4149,JHN,12,NRSV,blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord
4150,JHN,12,NRSV,the king of israel
4151,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus found a young donkey and sat on it as it is written
4152,JHN,12,NRSV,do not be afraid daughter of zion
4153,JHN,12,NRSV,look your king is coming
4154,JHN,12,NRSV,sitting on a donkeys colt
4155,JHN,12,NRSV,his disciples did not understand these things at first but when jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him
4156,JHN,12,NRSV,so the crowd that had been with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify
4157,JHN,12,NRSV,it was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him
4158,JHN,12,NRSV,the pharisees then said to one another you see you can do nothing look the world has gone after him
4159,JHN,12,NRSV,now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some greeks
4160,JHN,12,NRSV,they came to philip who was from bethsaida in galilee and said to him sir we wish to see jesus
4161,JHN,12,NRSV,philip went and told andrew then andrew and philip went and told jesus
4162,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus answered them the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified
4163,JHN,12,NRSV,very truly i tell you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain but if it dies it bears much fruit
4164,JHN,12,NRSV,those who love their life lose it and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life
4165,JHN,12,NRSV,whoever serves me must follow me and where i am there will my servant be also whoever serves me the father will honor
4166,JHN,12,NRSV,now my soul is troubled and what should i sayfather save me from this hour no it is for this reason that i have come to this hour
4167,JHN,12,NRSV,father glorify your name then a voice came from heaven i have glorified it and i will glorify it again
4168,JHN,12,NRSV,the crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder others said an angel has spoken to him
4169,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus answered this voice has come for your sake not for mine
4170,JHN,12,NRSV,now is the judgment of this world now the ruler of this world will be driven out
4171,JHN,12,NRSV,and i when i am lifted up from the earth will draw all people
4172,JHN,12,NRSV,to myself
4173,JHN,12,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die
4174,JHN,12,NRSV,the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the messiah
4175,JHN,12,NRSV,remains forever how can you say that the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
4176,JHN,12,NRSV,jesus said to them the light is with you for a little longer walk while you have the light so that the darkness may not overtake you if you walk in the darkness you do not know where you are going
4177,JHN,12,NRSV,while you have the light believe in the light so that you may become children of light
4178,JHN,12,NRSV,after jesus had said this he departed and hid from them
4179,JHN,12,NRSV,although he had performed so many signs in their presence they did not believe in him
4180,JHN,12,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet isaiah
4181,JHN,12,NRSV,lord who has believed our message
4182,JHN,12,NRSV,and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed
4183,JHN,12,NRSV,and so they could not believe because isaiah also said
4184,JHN,12,NRSV,he has blinded their eyes
4185,JHN,12,NRSV,and hardened their heart
4186,JHN,12,NRSV,so that they might not look with their eyes
4187,JHN,12,NRSV,and understand with their heart and turn
4188,JHN,12,NRSV,and i would heal them
4189,JHN,12,NRSV,isaiah said this because
4190,JHN,12,NRSV,he saw his glory and spoke about him
4191,JHN,12,NRSV,nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him but because of the pharisees they did not confess it for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue
4192,JHN,12,NRSV,for they loved human glory more than the glory that comes from god
4193,JHN,12,NRSV,then jesus cried aloud whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me
4194,JHN,12,NRSV,and whoever sees me sees him who sent me
4195,JHN,12,NRSV,i have come as light into the world so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness
4196,JHN,12,NRSV,i do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
4197,JHN,12,NRSV,the one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge on the last day the word that i have spoken will serve as judge
4198,JHN,12,NRSV,for i have not spoken on my own but the father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak
4199,JHN,12,NRSV,and i know that his commandment is eternal life what i speak therefore i speak just as the father has told me
4200,JHN,13,NRSV,now before the festival of the passover jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end
4201,JHN,13,NRSV,the devil had already put it into the heart of judas son of simon iscariot to betray him and during supper
4202,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from god and was going to god
4203,JHN,13,NRSV,got up from the table
4204,JHN,13,NRSV,took off his outer robe and tied a towel around himself
4205,JHN,13,NRSV,then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him
4206,JHN,13,NRSV,he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet
4207,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered you do not know now what i am doing but later you will understand
4208,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him you will never wash my feet jesus answered unless i wash you you have no share with me
4209,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head
4210,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus said to him one who has bathed does not need to wash except for the feet
4211,JHN,13,NRSV,but is entirely clean and you
4212,JHN,13,NRSV,are clean though not all of you
4213,JHN,13,NRSV,for he knew who was to betray him for this reason he said not all of you are clean
4214,JHN,13,NRSV,after he had washed their feet had put on his robe and had returned to the table he said to them do you know what i have done to you
4215,JHN,13,NRSV,you call me teacher and lordand you are right for that is what i am
4216,JHN,13,NRSV,so if i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet
4217,JHN,13,NRSV,for i have set you an example that you also should do as i have done to you
4218,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you servants
4219,JHN,13,NRSV,are not greater than their master nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them
4220,JHN,13,NRSV,if you know these things you are blessed if you do them
4221,JHN,13,NRSV,i am not speaking of all of you i know whom i have chosen but it is to fulfill the scripture the one who ate my bread
4222,JHN,13,NRSV,has lifted his heel against me
4223,JHN,13,NRSV,i tell you this now before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he
4224,JHN,13,NRSV,very truly i tell you whoever receives one whom i send receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me
4225,JHN,13,NRSV,after saying this jesus was troubled in spirit and declared very truly i tell you one of you will betray me
4226,JHN,13,NRSV,the disciples looked at one another uncertain of whom he was speaking
4227,JHN,13,NRSV,one of his disciplesthe one whom jesus lovedwas reclining next to him
4228,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter therefore motioned to him to ask jesus of whom he was speaking
4229,JHN,13,NRSV,so while reclining next to jesus he asked him lord who is it
4230,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered it is the one to whom i give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish
4231,JHN,13,NRSV,so when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot
4232,JHN,13,NRSV,after he received the piece of bread
4233,JHN,13,NRSV,satan entered into him jesus said to him do quickly what you are going to do
4234,JHN,13,NRSV,now no one at the table knew why he said this to him
4235,JHN,13,NRSV,some thought that because judas had the common purse jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor
4236,JHN,13,NRSV,so after receiving the piece of bread he immediately went out and it was night
4237,JHN,13,NRSV,when he had gone out jesus said now the son of man has been glorified and god has been glorified in him
4238,JHN,13,NRSV,if god has been glorified in him
4239,JHN,13,NRSV,god will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once
4240,JHN,13,NRSV,little children i am with you only a little longer you will look for me and as i said to the jews so now i say to you where i am going you cannot come
4241,JHN,13,NRSV,i give you a new commandment that you love one another just as i have loved you you also should love one another
4242,JHN,13,NRSV,by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
4243,JHN,13,NRSV,simon peter said to him lord where are you going jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow afterward
4244,JHN,13,NRSV,peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now i will lay down my life for you
4245,JHN,13,NRSV,jesus answered will you lay down your life for me very truly i tell you before the cock crows you will have denied me three times
4246,JHN,14,NRSV,do not let your hearts be troubled believe
4247,JHN,14,NRSV,in god believe also in me
4248,JHN,14,NRSV,in my fathers house there are many dwelling places if it were not so would i have told you that i go to prepare a place for you
4249,JHN,14,NRSV,and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself so that where i am there you may be also
4250,JHN,14,NRSV,and you know the way to the place where i am going
4251,JHN,14,NRSV,thomas said to him lord we do not know where you are going how can we know the way
4252,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
4253,JHN,14,NRSV,if you know me you will know
4254,JHN,14,NRSV,my father also from now on you do know him and have seen him
4255,JHN,14,NRSV,philip said to him lord show us the father and we will be satisfied
4256,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus said to him have i been with you all this time philip and you still do not know me whoever has seen me has seen the father how can you say show us the father
4257,JHN,14,NRSV,do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own but the father who dwells in me does his works
4258,JHN,14,NRSV,believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me but if you do not then believe me because of the works themselves
4259,JHN,14,NRSV,very truly i tell you the one who believes in me will also do the works that i do and in fact will do greater works than these because i am going to the father
4260,JHN,14,NRSV,i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son
4261,JHN,14,NRSV,if in my name you ask me
4262,JHN,14,NRSV,for anything i will do it
4263,JHN,14,NRSV,if you love me you will keep
4264,JHN,14,NRSV,my commandments
4265,JHN,14,NRSV,and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate
4266,JHN,14,NRSV,to be with you forever
4267,JHN,14,NRSV,this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him you know him because he abides with you and he will be in
4268,JHN,14,NRSV,you
4269,JHN,14,NRSV,i will not leave you orphaned i am coming to you
4270,JHN,14,NRSV,in a little while the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you also will live
4271,JHN,14,NRSV,on that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you
4272,JHN,14,NRSV,they who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me and those who love me will be loved by my father and i will love them and reveal myself to them
4273,JHN,14,NRSV,judas not iscariot said to him lord how is it that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world
4274,JHN,14,NRSV,jesus answered him those who love me will keep my word and my father will love them and we will come to them and make our home with them
4275,JHN,14,NRSV,whoever does not love me does not keep my words and the word that you hear is not mine but is from the father who sent me
4276,JHN,14,NRSV,i have said these things to you while i am still with you
4277,JHN,14,NRSV,but the advocate
4278,JHN,14,NRSV,the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you
4279,JHN,14,NRSV,peace i leave with you my peace i give to you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not let them be afraid
4280,JHN,14,NRSV,you heard me say to you i am going away and i am coming to you if you loved me you would rejoice that i am going to the father because the father is greater than i
4281,JHN,14,NRSV,and now i have told you this before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe
4282,JHN,14,NRSV,i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming he has no power over me
4283,JHN,14,NRSV,but i do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that i love the father rise let us be on our way
4284,JHN,15,NRSV,i am the true vine and my father is the vinegrower
4285,JHN,15,NRSV,he removes every branch in me that bears no fruit every branch that bears fruit he prunes
4286,JHN,15,NRSV,to make it bear more fruit
4287,JHN,15,NRSV,you have already been cleansed
4288,JHN,15,NRSV,by the word that i have spoken to you
4289,JHN,15,NRSV,abide in me as i abide in you just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me
4290,JHN,15,NRSV,i am the vine you are the branches those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing
4291,JHN,15,NRSV,whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers such branches are gathered thrown into the fire and burned
4292,JHN,15,NRSV,if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask for whatever you wish and it will be done for you
4293,JHN,15,NRSV,my father is glorified by this that you bear much fruit and become
4294,JHN,15,NRSV,my disciples
4295,JHN,15,NRSV,as the father has loved me so i have loved you abide in my love
4296,JHN,15,NRSV,if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
4297,JHN,15,NRSV,i have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete
4298,JHN,15,NRSV,this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you
4299,JHN,15,NRSV,no one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends
4300,JHN,15,NRSV,you are my friends if you do what i command you
4301,JHN,15,NRSV,i do not call you servants
4302,JHN,15,NRSV,any longer because the servant
4303,JHN,15,NRSV,does not know what the master is doing but i have called you friends because i have made known to you everything that i have heard from my father
4304,JHN,15,NRSV,you did not choose me but i chose you and i appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last so that the father will give you whatever you ask him in my name
4305,JHN,15,NRSV,i am giving you these commands so that you may love one another
4306,JHN,15,NRSV,if the world hates you be aware that it hated me before it hated you
4307,JHN,15,NRSV,if you belonged to the world
4308,JHN,15,NRSV,the world would love you as its own because you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hates you
4309,JHN,15,NRSV,remember the word that i said to you servants
4310,JHN,15,NRSV,are not greater than their master if they persecuted me they will persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also
4311,JHN,15,NRSV,but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
4312,JHN,15,NRSV,if i had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin but now they have no excuse for their sin
4313,JHN,15,NRSV,whoever hates me hates my father also
4314,JHN,15,NRSV,if i had not done among them the works that no one else did they would not have sin but now they have seen and hated both me and my father
4315,JHN,15,NRSV,it was to fulfill the word that is written in their law they hated me without a cause
4316,JHN,15,NRSV,when the advocate
4317,JHN,15,NRSV,comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who comes from the father he will testify on my behalf
4318,JHN,15,NRSV,you also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning
4319,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling
4320,JHN,16,NRSV,they will put you out of the synagogues indeed an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to god
4321,JHN,16,NRSV,and they will do this because they have not known the father or me
4322,JHN,16,NRSV,but i have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that i told you about them
4323,JHN,16,NRSV,i did not say these things to you from the beginning because i was with you
4324,JHN,16,NRSV,but now i am going to him who sent me yet none of you asks me where are you going
4325,JHN,16,NRSV,but because i have said these things to you sorrow has filled your hearts
4326,JHN,16,NRSV,nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the advocate
4327,JHN,16,NRSV,will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you
4328,JHN,16,NRSV,and when he comes he will prove the world wrong about
4329,JHN,16,NRSV,sin and righteousness and judgment
4330,JHN,16,NRSV,about sin because they do not believe in me
4331,JHN,16,NRSV,about righteousness because i am going to the father and you will see me no longer
4332,JHN,16,NRSV,about judgment because the ruler of this world has been condemned
4333,JHN,16,NRSV,i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
4334,JHN,16,NRSV,when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak on his own but will speak whatever he hears and he will declare to you the things that are to come
4335,JHN,16,NRSV,he will glorify me because he will take what is mine and declare it to you
4336,JHN,16,NRSV,all that the father has is mine for this reason i said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you
4337,JHN,16,NRSV,a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me
4338,JHN,16,NRSV,then some of his disciples said to one another what does he mean by saying to us a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me and because i am going to the father
4339,JHN,16,NRSV,they said what does he mean by this a little while we do not know what he is talking about
4340,JHN,16,NRSV,jesus knew that they wanted to ask him so he said to them are you discussing among yourselves what i meant when i said a little while and you will no longer see me and again a little while and you will see me
4341,JHN,16,NRSV,very truly i tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice you will have pain but your pain will turn into joy
4342,JHN,16,NRSV,when a woman is in labor she has pain because her hour has come but when her child is born she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world
4343,JHN,16,NRSV,so you have pain now but i will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take your joy from you
4344,JHN,16,NRSV,on that day you will ask nothing of me
4345,JHN,16,NRSV,very truly i tell you if you ask anything of the father in my name he will give it to you
4346,JHN,16,NRSV,until now you have not asked for anything in my name ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete
4347,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said these things to you in figures of speech the hour is coming when i will no longer speak to you in figures but will tell you plainly of the father
4348,JHN,16,NRSV,on that day you will ask in my name i do not say to you that i will ask the father on your behalf
4349,JHN,16,NRSV,for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came from god
4350,JHN,16,NRSV,i came from the father and have come into the world again i am leaving the world and am going to the father
4351,JHN,16,NRSV,his disciples said yes now you are speaking plainly not in any figure of speech
4352,JHN,16,NRSV,now we know that you know all things and do not need to have anyone question you by this we believe that you came from god
4353,JHN,16,NRSV,jesus answered them do you now believe
4354,JHN,16,NRSV,the hour is coming indeed it has come when you will be scattered each one to his home and you will leave me alone yet i am not alone because the father is with me
4355,JHN,16,NRSV,i have said this to you so that in me you may have peace in the world you face persecution but take courage i have conquered the world
4356,JHN,17,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he looked up to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify your son so that the son may glorify you
4357,JHN,17,NRSV,since you have given him authority over all people
4358,JHN,17,NRSV,to give eternal life to all whom you have given him
4359,JHN,17,NRSV,and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
4360,JHN,17,NRSV,i glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do
4361,JHN,17,NRSV,so now father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that i had in your presence before the world existed
4362,JHN,17,NRSV,i have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world they were yours and you gave them to me and they have kept your word
4363,JHN,17,NRSV,now they know that everything you have given me is from you
4364,JHN,17,NRSV,for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth that i came from you and they have believed that you sent me
4365,JHN,17,NRSV,i am asking on their behalf i am not asking on behalf of the world but on behalf of those whom you gave me because they are yours
4366,JHN,17,NRSV,all mine are yours and yours are mine and i have been glorified in them
4367,JHN,17,NRSV,and now i am no longer in the world but they are in the world and i am coming to you holy father protect them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one as we are one
4368,JHN,17,NRSV,while i was with them i protected them in your name that
4369,JHN,17,NRSV,you have given me i guarded them and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost
4370,JHN,17,NRSV,so that the scripture might be fulfilled
4371,JHN,17,NRSV,but now i am coming to you and i speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves
4372,JHN,17,NRSV,i have given them your word and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world
4373,JHN,17,NRSV,i am not asking you to take them out of the world but i ask you to protect them from the evil one
4374,JHN,17,NRSV,they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world
4375,JHN,17,NRSV,sanctify them in the truth your word is truth
4376,JHN,17,NRSV,as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world
4377,JHN,17,NRSV,and for their sakes i sanctify myself so that they also may be sanctified in truth
4378,JHN,17,NRSV,i ask not only on behalf of these but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word
4379,JHN,17,NRSV,that they may all be one as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be in us
4380,JHN,17,NRSV,so that the world may believe that you have sent me
4381,JHN,17,NRSV,the glory that you have given me i have given them so that they may be one as we are one
4382,JHN,17,NRSV,i in them and you in me that they may become completely one so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me
4383,JHN,17,NRSV,father i desire that those also whom you have given me may be with me where i am to see my glory which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world
4384,JHN,17,NRSV,righteous father the world does not know you but i know you and these know that you have sent me
4385,JHN,17,NRSV,i made your name known to them and i will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them and i in them
4386,JHN,18,NRSV,after jesus had spoken these words he went out with his disciples across the kidron valley to a place where there was a garden which he and his disciples entered
4387,JHN,18,NRSV,now judas who betrayed him also knew the place because jesus often met there with his disciples
4388,JHN,18,NRSV,so judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the pharisees and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons
4389,JHN,18,NRSV,then jesus knowing all that was to happen to him came forward and asked them whom are you looking for
4390,JHN,18,NRSV,they answered jesus of nazareth
4391,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus replied i am he
4392,JHN,18,NRSV,judas who betrayed him was standing with them
4393,JHN,18,NRSV,when jesus
4394,JHN,18,NRSV,said to them i am he
4395,JHN,18,NRSV,they stepped back and fell to the ground
4396,JHN,18,NRSV,again he asked them whom are you looking for and they said jesus of nazareth
4397,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i told you that i am he
4398,JHN,18,NRSV,so if you are looking for me let these men go
4399,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill the word that he had spoken i did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me
4400,JHN,18,NRSV,then simon peter who had a sword drew it struck the high priests slave and cut off his right ear the slaves name was malchus
4401,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus said to peter put your sword back into its sheath am i not to drink the cup that the father has given me
4402,JHN,18,NRSV,so the soldiers their officer and the jewish police arrested jesus and bound him
4403,JHN,18,NRSV,first they took him to annas who was the fatherinlaw of caiaphas the high priest that year
4404,JHN,18,NRSV,caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it was better to have one person die for the people
4405,JHN,18,NRSV,simon peter and another disciple followed jesus since that disciple was known to the high priest he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest
4406,JHN,18,NRSV,but peter was standing outside at the gate so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out spoke to the woman who guarded the gate and brought peter in
4407,JHN,18,NRSV,the woman said to peter you are not also one of this mans disciples are you he said i am not
4408,JHN,18,NRSV,now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold and they were standing around it and warming themselves peter also was standing with them and warming himself
4409,JHN,18,NRSV,then the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching
4410,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered i have spoken openly to the world i have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together i have said nothing in secret
4411,JHN,18,NRSV,why do you ask me ask those who heard what i said to them they know what i said
4412,JHN,18,NRSV,when he had said this one of the police standing nearby struck jesus on the face saying is that how you answer the high priest
4413,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered if i have spoken wrongly testify to the wrong but if i have spoken rightly why do you strike me
4414,JHN,18,NRSV,then annas sent him bound to caiaphas the high priest
4415,JHN,18,NRSV,now simon peter was standing and warming himself they asked him you are not also one of his disciples are you he denied it and said i am not
4416,JHN,18,NRSV,one of the slaves of the high priest a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off asked did i not see you in the garden with him
4417,JHN,18,NRSV,again peter denied it and at that moment the cock crowed
4418,JHN,18,NRSV,then they took jesus from caiaphas to pilates headquarters
4419,JHN,18,NRSV,it was early in the morning they themselves did not enter the headquarters
4420,JHN,18,NRSV,so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the passover
4421,JHN,18,NRSV,so pilate went out to them and said what accusation do you bring against this man
4422,JHN,18,NRSV,they answered if this man were not a criminal we would not have handed him over to you
4423,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law the jews replied we are not permitted to put anyone to death
4424,JHN,18,NRSV,this was to fulfill what jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die
4425,JHN,18,NRSV,then pilate entered the headquarters
4426,JHN,18,NRSV,again summoned jesus and asked him are you the king of the jews
4427,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered do you ask this on your own or did others tell you about me
4428,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate replied i am not a jew am i your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me what have you done
4429,JHN,18,NRSV,jesus answered my kingdom is not from this world if my kingdom were from this world my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the jews but as it is my kingdom is not from here
4430,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him so you are a king jesus answered you say that i am a king for this i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice
4431,JHN,18,NRSV,pilate asked him what is truth
4432,JHN,18,NRSV,after he had said this he went out to the jews again and told them i find no case against him
4433,JHN,18,NRSV,but you have a custom that i release someone for you at the passover do you want me to release for you the king of the jews
4434,JHN,18,NRSV,they shouted in reply not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a bandit
4435,JHN,19,NRSV,then pilate took jesus and had him flogged
4436,JHN,19,NRSV,and the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they dressed him in a purple robe
4437,JHN,19,NRSV,they kept coming up to him saying hail king of the jews and striking him on the face
4438,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate went out again and said to them look i am bringing him out to you to let you know that i find no case against him
4439,JHN,19,NRSV,so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe pilate said to them here is the man
4440,JHN,19,NRSV,when the chief priests and the police saw him they shouted crucify him crucify him pilate said to them take him yourselves and crucify him i find no case against him
4441,JHN,19,NRSV,the jews answered him we have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the son of god
4442,JHN,19,NRSV,now when pilate heard this he was more afraid than ever
4443,JHN,19,NRSV,he entered his headquarters
4444,JHN,19,NRSV,again and asked jesus where are you from but jesus gave him no answer
4445,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate therefore said to him do you refuse to speak to me do you not know that i have power to release you and power to crucify you
4446,JHN,19,NRSV,jesus answered him you would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin
4447,JHN,19,NRSV,from then on pilate tried to release him but the jews cried out if you release this man you are no friend of the emperor everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor
4448,JHN,19,NRSV,when pilate heard these words he brought jesus outside and sat
4449,JHN,19,NRSV,on the judges bench at a place called the stone pavement or in hebrew
4450,JHN,19,NRSV,gabbatha
4451,JHN,19,NRSV,now it was the day of preparation for the passover and it was about noon he said to the jews here is your king
4452,JHN,19,NRSV,they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate asked them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but the emperor
4453,JHN,19,NRSV,then he handed him over to them to be crucified
4454,JHN,19,NRSV,so they took jesus
4455,JHN,19,NRSV,and carrying the cross by himself he went out to what is called the place of the skull which in hebrew
4456,JHN,19,NRSV,is called golgotha
4457,JHN,19,NRSV,there they crucified him and with him two others one on either side with jesus between them
4458,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross it read jesus of nazareth
4459,JHN,19,NRSV,the king of the jews
4460,JHN,19,NRSV,many of the jews read this inscription because the place where jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in hebrew
4461,JHN,19,NRSV,in latin and in greek
4462,JHN,19,NRSV,then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not write the king of the jews but this man said i am king of the jews
4463,JHN,19,NRSV,pilate answered what i have written i have written
4464,JHN,19,NRSV,when the soldiers had crucified jesus they took his clothes and divided them into four parts one for each soldier they also took his tunic now the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from the top
4465,JHN,19,NRSV,so they said to one another let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see who will get it this was to fulfill what the scripture says
4466,JHN,19,NRSV,they divided my clothes among themselves
4467,JHN,19,NRSV,and for my clothing they cast lots
4468,JHN,19,NRSV,and that is what the soldiers did
4469,JHN,19,NRSV,meanwhile standing near the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene
4470,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her he said to his mother woman here is your son
4471,JHN,19,NRSV,then he said to the disciple here is your mother and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home
4472,JHN,19,NRSV,after this when jesus knew that all was now finished he said in order to fulfill the scripture i am thirsty
4473,JHN,19,NRSV,a jar full of sour wine was standing there so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth
4474,JHN,19,NRSV,when jesus had received the wine he said it is finished then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit
4475,JHN,19,NRSV,since it was the day of preparation the jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity so they asked pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed
4476,JHN,19,NRSV,then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him
4477,JHN,19,NRSV,but when they came to jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs
4478,JHN,19,NRSV,instead one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and at once blood and water came out
4479,JHN,19,NRSV,he who saw this has testified so that you also may believe his testimony is true and he knows
4480,JHN,19,NRSV,that he tells the truth
4481,JHN,19,NRSV,these things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled none of his bones shall be broken
4482,JHN,19,NRSV,and again another passage of scripture says they will look on the one whom they have pierced
4483,JHN,19,NRSV,after these things joseph of arimathea who was a disciple of jesus though a secret one because of his fear of the jews asked pilate to let him take away the body of jesus pilate gave him permission so he came and removed his body
4484,JHN,19,NRSV,nicodemus who had at first come to jesus by night also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds
4485,JHN,19,NRSV,they took the body of jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths according to the burial custom of the jews
4486,JHN,19,NRSV,now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid
4487,JHN,19,NRSV,and so because it was the jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there
4488,JHN,20,NRSV,early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb
4489,JHN,20,NRSV,so she ran and went to simon peter and the other disciple the one whom jesus loved and said to them they have taken the lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him
4490,JHN,20,NRSV,then peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb
4491,JHN,20,NRSV,the two were running together but the other disciple outran peter and reached the tomb first
4492,JHN,20,NRSV,he bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there but he did not go in
4493,JHN,20,NRSV,then simon peter came following him and went into the tomb he saw the linen wrappings lying there
4494,JHN,20,NRSV,and the cloth that had been on jesus head not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself
4495,JHN,20,NRSV,then the other disciple who reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed
4496,JHN,20,NRSV,for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead
4497,JHN,20,NRSV,then the disciples returned to their homes
4498,JHN,20,NRSV,but mary stood weeping outside the tomb as she wept she bent over to look
4499,JHN,20,NRSV,into the tomb
4500,JHN,20,NRSV,and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and the other at the feet
4501,JHN,20,NRSV,they said to her woman why are you weeping she said to them they have taken away my lord and i do not know where they have laid him
4502,JHN,20,NRSV,when she had said this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not know that it was jesus
4503,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her woman why are you weeping whom are you looking for supposing him to be the gardener she said to him sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have laid him and i will take him away
4504,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in hebrew
4505,JHN,20,NRSV,rabbouni which means teacher
4506,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to her do not hold on to me because i have not yet ascended to the father but go to my brothers and say to them i am ascending to my father and your father to my god and your god
4507,JHN,20,NRSV,mary magdalene went and announced to the disciples i have seen the lord and she told them that he had said these things to her
4508,JHN,20,NRSV,when it was evening on that day the first day of the week and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the jews jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you
4509,JHN,20,NRSV,after he said this he showed them his hands and his side then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the lord
4510,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to them again peace be with you as the father has sent me so i send you
4511,JHN,20,NRSV,when he had said this he breathed on them and said to them receive the holy spirit
4512,JHN,20,NRSV,if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven them if you retain the sins of any they are retained
4513,JHN,20,NRSV,but thomas who was called the twin
4514,JHN,20,NRSV,one of the twelve was not with them when jesus came
4515,JHN,20,NRSV,so the other disciples told him we have seen the lord but he said to them unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe
4516,JHN,20,NRSV,a week later his disciples were again in the house and thomas was with them although the doors were shut jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you
4517,JHN,20,NRSV,then he said to thomas put your finger here and see my hands reach out your hand and put it in my side do not doubt but believe
4518,JHN,20,NRSV,thomas answered him my lord and my god
4519,JHN,20,NRSV,jesus said to him have you believed because you have seen me blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe
4520,JHN,20,NRSV,now jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book
4521,JHN,20,NRSV,but these are written so that you may come to believe
4522,JHN,20,NRSV,that jesus is the messiah
4523,JHN,20,NRSV,the son of god and that through believing you may have life in his name
4524,JHN,21,NRSV,after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the sea of tiberias and he showed himself in this way
4525,JHN,21,NRSV,gathered there together were simon peter thomas called the twin
4526,JHN,21,NRSV,nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples
4527,JHN,21,NRSV,simon peter said to them i am going fishing they said to him we will go with you they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing
4528,JHN,21,NRSV,just after daybreak jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know that it was jesus
4529,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them children you have no fish have you they answered him no
4530,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to them cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find some so they cast it and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish
4531,JHN,21,NRSV,that disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord when simon peter heard that it was the lord he put on some clothes for he was naked and jumped into the sea
4532,JHN,21,NRSV,but the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not far from the land only about a hundred yards
4533,JHN,21,NRSV,off
4534,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had gone ashore they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and bread
4535,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them bring some of the fish that you have just caught
4536,JHN,21,NRSV,so simon peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish a hundred fiftythree of them and though there were so many the net was not torn
4537,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to them come and have breakfast now none of the disciples dared to ask him who are you because they knew it was the lord
4538,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish
4539,JHN,21,NRSV,this was now the third time that jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead
4540,JHN,21,NRSV,when they had finished breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these he said to him yes lord you know that i love you jesus said to him feed my lambs
4541,JHN,21,NRSV,a second time he said to him simon son of john do you love me he said to him yes lord you know that i love you jesus said to him tend my sheep
4542,JHN,21,NRSV,he said to him the third time simon son of john do you love me peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time do you love me and he said to him lord you know everything you know that i love you jesus said to him feed my sheep
4543,JHN,21,NRSV,very truly i tell you when you were younger you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go
4544,JHN,21,NRSV,he said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify god after this he said to him follow me
4545,JHN,21,NRSV,peter turned and saw the disciple whom jesus loved following them he was the one who had reclined next to jesus at the supper and had said lord who is it that is going to betray you
4546,JHN,21,NRSV,when peter saw him he said to jesus lord what about him
4547,JHN,21,NRSV,jesus said to him if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you follow me
4548,JHN,21,NRSV,so the rumor spread in the community
4549,JHN,21,NRSV,that this disciple would not die yet jesus did not say to him that he would not die but if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you
4550,JHN,21,NRSV,this is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them and we know that his testimony is true
4551,JHN,21,NRSV,but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written
4552,ACT,1,NRSV,in the first book theophilus i wrote about all that jesus did and taught from the beginning
4553,ACT,1,NRSV,until the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the holy spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen
4554,ACT,1,NRSV,after his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of god
4555,ACT,1,NRSV,while staying
4556,ACT,1,NRSV,with them he ordered them not to leave jerusalem but to wait there for the promise of the father this he said is what you have heard from me
4557,ACT,1,NRSV,for john baptized with water but you will be baptized with
4558,ACT,1,NRSV,the holy spirit not many days from now
4559,ACT,1,NRSV,so when they had come together they asked him lord is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to israel
4560,ACT,1,NRSV,he replied it is not for you to know the times or periods that the father has set by his own authority
4561,ACT,1,NRSV,but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
4562,ACT,1,NRSV,when he had said this as they were watching he was lifted up and a cloud took him out of their sight
4563,ACT,1,NRSV,while he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven suddenly two men in white robes stood by them
4564,ACT,1,NRSV,they said men of galilee why do you stand looking up toward heaven this jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven
4565,ACT,1,NRSV,then they returned to jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is near jerusalem a sabbath days journey away
4566,ACT,1,NRSV,when they had entered the city they went to the room upstairs where they were staying peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas son of
4567,ACT,1,NRSV,james
4568,ACT,1,NRSV,all these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer together with certain women including mary the mother of jesus as well as his brothers
4569,ACT,1,NRSV,in those days peter stood up among the believers
4570,ACT,1,NRSV,together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons and said
4571,ACT,1,NRSV,friends
4572,ACT,1,NRSV,the scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy spirit through david foretold concerning judas who became a guide for those who arrested jesus
4573,ACT,1,NRSV,for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry
4574,ACT,1,NRSV,now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong
4575,ACT,1,NRSV,he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out
4576,ACT,1,NRSV,this became known to all the residents of jerusalem so that the field was called in their language hakeldama that is field of blood
4577,ACT,1,NRSV,for it is written in the book of psalms
4578,ACT,1,NRSV,let his homestead become desolate
4579,ACT,1,NRSV,and let there be no one to live in it
4580,ACT,1,NRSV,and
4581,ACT,1,NRSV,let another take his position of overseer
4582,ACT,1,NRSV,so one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us
4583,ACT,1,NRSV,beginning from the baptism of john until the day when he was taken up from usone of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection
4584,ACT,1,NRSV,so they proposed two joseph called barsabbas who was also known as justus and matthias
4585,ACT,1,NRSV,then they prayed and said lord you know everyones heart show us which one of these two you have chosen
4586,ACT,1,NRSV,to take the place
4587,ACT,1,NRSV,in this ministry and apostleship from which judas turned aside to go to his own place
4588,ACT,1,NRSV,and they cast lots for them and the lot fell on matthias and he was added to the eleven apostles
4589,ACT,2,NRSV,when the day of pentecost had come they were all together in one place
4590,ACT,2,NRSV,and suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting
4591,ACT,2,NRSV,divided tongues as of fire appeared among them and a tongue rested on each of them
4592,ACT,2,NRSV,all of them were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other languages as the spirit gave them ability
4593,ACT,2,NRSV,now there were devout jews from every nation under heaven living in jerusalem
4594,ACT,2,NRSV,and at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each
4595,ACT,2,NRSV,amazed and astonished they asked are not all these who are speaking galileans
4596,ACT,2,NRSV,and how is it that we hear each of us in our own native language
4597,ACT,2,NRSV,parthians medes elamites and residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia
4598,ACT,2,NRSV,phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya belonging to cyrene and visitors from rome both jews and proselytes
4599,ACT,2,NRSV,cretans and arabsin our own languages we hear them speaking about gods deeds of power
4600,ACT,2,NRSV,all were amazed and perplexed saying to one another what does this mean
4601,ACT,2,NRSV,but others sneered and said they are filled with new wine
4602,ACT,2,NRSV,but peter standing with the eleven raised his voice and addressed them men of judea and all who live in jerusalem let this be known to you and listen to what i say
4603,ACT,2,NRSV,indeed these are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning
4604,ACT,2,NRSV,no this is what was spoken through the prophet joel
4605,ACT,2,NRSV,in the last days it will be god declares
4606,ACT,2,NRSV,that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
4607,ACT,2,NRSV,and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy
4608,ACT,2,NRSV,and your young men shall see visions
4609,ACT,2,NRSV,and your old men shall dream dreams
4610,ACT,2,NRSV,even upon my slaves both men and women
4611,ACT,2,NRSV,in those days i will pour out my spirit
4612,ACT,2,NRSV,and they shall prophesy
4613,ACT,2,NRSV,and i will show portents in the heaven above
4614,ACT,2,NRSV,and signs on the earth below
4615,ACT,2,NRSV,blood and fire and smoky mist
4616,ACT,2,NRSV,the sun shall be turned to darkness
4617,ACT,2,NRSV,and the moon to blood
4618,ACT,2,NRSV,before the coming of the lords great and glorious day
4619,ACT,2,NRSV,then everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
4620,ACT,2,NRSV,you that are israelites
4621,ACT,2,NRSV,listen to what i have to say jesus of nazareth
4622,ACT,2,NRSV,a man attested to you by god with deeds of power wonders and signs that god did through him among you as you yourselves know
4623,ACT,2,NRSV,this man handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law
4624,ACT,2,NRSV,but god raised him up having freed him from death
4625,ACT,2,NRSV,because it was impossible for him to be held in its power
4626,ACT,2,NRSV,for david says concerning him
4627,ACT,2,NRSV,i saw the lord always before me
4628,ACT,2,NRSV,for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken
4629,ACT,2,NRSV,therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced
4630,ACT,2,NRSV,moreover my flesh will live in hope
4631,ACT,2,NRSV,for you will not abandon my soul to hades
4632,ACT,2,NRSV,or let your holy one experience corruption
4633,ACT,2,NRSV,you have made known to me the ways of life
4634,ACT,2,NRSV,you will make me full of gladness with your presence
4635,ACT,2,NRSV,fellow israelites
4636,ACT,2,NRSV,i may say to you confidently of our ancestor david that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day
4637,ACT,2,NRSV,since he was a prophet he knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne
4638,ACT,2,NRSV,foreseeing this david
4639,ACT,2,NRSV,spoke of the resurrection of the messiah
4640,ACT,2,NRSV,saying
4641,ACT,2,NRSV,he was not abandoned to hades
4642,ACT,2,NRSV,nor did his flesh experience corruption
4643,ACT,2,NRSV,this jesus god raised up and of that all of us are witnesses
4644,ACT,2,NRSV,being therefore exalted at
4645,ACT,2,NRSV,the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured out this that you both see and hear
4646,ACT,2,NRSV,for david did not ascend into the heavens but he himself says
4647,ACT,2,NRSV,the lord said to my lord
4648,ACT,2,NRSV,sit at my right hand
4649,ACT,2,NRSV,until i make your enemies your footstool
4650,ACT,2,NRSV,therefore let the entire house of israel know with certainty that god has made him both lord and messiah
4651,ACT,2,NRSV,this jesus whom you crucified
4652,ACT,2,NRSV,now when they heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and to the other apostles brothers
4653,ACT,2,NRSV,what should we do
4654,ACT,2,NRSV,peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ so that your sins may be forgiven and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
4655,ACT,2,NRSV,for the promise is for you for your children and for all who are far away everyone whom the lord our god calls to him
4656,ACT,2,NRSV,and he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them saying save yourselves from this corrupt generation
4657,ACT,2,NRSV,so those who welcomed his message were baptized and that day about three thousand persons were added
4658,ACT,2,NRSV,they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers
4659,ACT,2,NRSV,awe came upon everyone because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles
4660,ACT,2,NRSV,all who believed were together and had all things in common
4661,ACT,2,NRSV,they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds
4662,ACT,2,NRSV,to all as any had need
4663,ACT,2,NRSV,day by day as they spent much time together in the temple they broke bread at home
4664,ACT,2,NRSV,and ate their food with glad and generous
4665,ACT,2,NRSV,hearts
4666,ACT,2,NRSV,praising god and having the goodwill of all the people and day by day the lord added to their number those who were being saved
4667,ACT,3,NRSV,one day peter and john were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer at three oclock in the afternoon
4668,ACT,3,NRSV,and a man lame from birth was being carried in people would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the beautiful gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple
4669,ACT,3,NRSV,when he saw peter and john about to go into the temple he asked them for alms
4670,ACT,3,NRSV,peter looked intently at him as did john and said look at us
4671,ACT,3,NRSV,and he fixed his attention on them expecting to receive something from them
4672,ACT,3,NRSV,but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
4673,ACT,3,NRSV,stand up and walk
4674,ACT,3,NRSV,and he took him by the right hand and raised him up and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong
4675,ACT,3,NRSV,jumping up he stood and began to walk and he entered the temple with them walking and leaping and praising god
4676,ACT,3,NRSV,all the people saw him walking and praising god
4677,ACT,3,NRSV,and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him
4678,ACT,3,NRSV,while he clung to peter and john all the people ran together to them in the portico called solomons portico utterly astonished
4679,ACT,3,NRSV,when peter saw it he addressed the people you israelites
4680,ACT,3,NRSV,why do you wonder at this or why do you stare at us as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk
4681,ACT,3,NRSV,the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob the god of our ancestors has glorified his servant
4682,ACT,3,NRSV,jesus whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of pilate though he had decided to release him
4683,ACT,3,NRSV,but you rejected the holy and righteous one and asked to have a murderer given to you
4684,ACT,3,NRSV,and you killed the author of life whom god raised from the dead to this we are witnesses
4685,ACT,3,NRSV,and by faith in his name his name itself has made this man strong whom you see and know and the faith that is through jesus
4686,ACT,3,NRSV,has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you
4687,ACT,3,NRSV,and now friends
4688,ACT,3,NRSV,i know that you acted in ignorance as did also your rulers
4689,ACT,3,NRSV,in this way god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets that his messiah
4690,ACT,3,NRSV,would suffer
4691,ACT,3,NRSV,repent therefore and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out
4692,ACT,3,NRSV,so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the lord and that he may send the messiah
4693,ACT,3,NRSV,appointed for you that is jesus
4694,ACT,3,NRSV,who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that god announced long ago through his holy prophets
4695,ACT,3,NRSV,moses said the lord your god will raise up for you from your own people
4696,ACT,3,NRSV,a prophet like me you must listen to whatever he tells you
4697,ACT,3,NRSV,and it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people
4698,ACT,3,NRSV,and all the prophets as many as have spoken from samuel and those after him also predicted these days
4699,ACT,3,NRSV,you are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that god gave to your ancestors saying to abraham and in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed
4700,ACT,3,NRSV,when god raised up his servant
4701,ACT,3,NRSV,he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways
4702,ACT,4,NRSV,while peter and john
4703,ACT,4,NRSV,were speaking to the people the priests the captain of the temple and the sadducees came to them
4704,ACT,4,NRSV,much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in jesus there is the resurrection of the dead
4705,ACT,4,NRSV,so they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening
4706,ACT,4,NRSV,but many of those who heard the word believed and they numbered about five thousand
4707,ACT,4,NRSV,the next day their rulers elders and scribes assembled in jerusalem
4708,ACT,4,NRSV,with annas the high priest caiaphas john
4709,ACT,4,NRSV,and alexander and all who were of the highpriestly family
4710,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had made the prisoners
4711,ACT,4,NRSV,stand in their midst they inquired by what power or by what name did you do this
4712,ACT,4,NRSV,then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them rulers of the people and elders
4713,ACT,4,NRSV,if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed
4714,ACT,4,NRSV,let it be known to all of you and to all the people of israel that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of jesus christ of nazareth
4715,ACT,4,NRSV,whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead
4716,ACT,4,NRSV,this jesus
4717,ACT,4,NRSV,is
4718,ACT,4,NRSV,the stone that was rejected by you the builders
4719,ACT,4,NRSV,it has become the cornerstone
4720,ACT,4,NRSV,there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved
4721,ACT,4,NRSV,now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were amazed and recognized them as companions of jesus
4722,ACT,4,NRSV,when they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition
4723,ACT,4,NRSV,so they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another
4724,ACT,4,NRSV,they said what will we do with them for it is obvious to all who live in jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them we cannot deny it
4725,ACT,4,NRSV,but to keep it from spreading further among the people let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name
4726,ACT,4,NRSV,so they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus
4727,ACT,4,NRSV,but peter and john answered them whether it is right in gods sight to listen to you rather than to god you must judge
4728,ACT,4,NRSV,for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard
4729,ACT,4,NRSV,after threatening them again they let them go finding no way to punish them because of the people for all of them praised god for what had happened
4730,ACT,4,NRSV,for the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old
4731,ACT,4,NRSV,after they were released they went to their friends
4732,ACT,4,NRSV,and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them
4733,ACT,4,NRSV,when they heard it they raised their voices together to god and said sovereign lord who made the heaven and the earth the sea and everything in them
4734,ACT,4,NRSV,it is you who said by the holy spirit through our ancestor david your servant
4735,ACT,4,NRSV,why did the gentiles rage
4736,ACT,4,NRSV,and the peoples imagine vain things
4737,ACT,4,NRSV,the kings of the earth took their stand
4738,ACT,4,NRSV,and the rulers have gathered together
4739,ACT,4,NRSV,against the lord and against his messiah
4740,ACT,4,NRSV,for in this city in fact both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the peoples of israel gathered together against your holy servant
4741,ACT,4,NRSV,jesus whom you anointed
4742,ACT,4,NRSV,to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place
4743,ACT,4,NRSV,and now lord look at their threats and grant to your servants
4744,ACT,4,NRSV,to speak your word with all boldness
4745,ACT,4,NRSV,while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant
4746,ACT,4,NRSV,jesus
4747,ACT,4,NRSV,when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god with boldness
4748,ACT,4,NRSV,now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions but everything they owned was held in common
4749,ACT,4,NRSV,with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
4750,ACT,4,NRSV,there was not a needy person among them for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold
4751,ACT,4,NRSV,they laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need
4752,ACT,4,NRSV,there was a levite a native of cyprus joseph to whom the apostles gave the name barnabas which means son of encouragement
4753,ACT,4,NRSV,he sold a field that belonged to him then brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
4754,ACT,5,NRSV,but a man named ananias with the consent of his wife sapphira sold a piece of property
4755,ACT,5,NRSV,with his wifes knowledge he kept back some of the proceeds and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet
4756,ACT,5,NRSV,ananias peter asked why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land
4757,ACT,5,NRSV,while it remained unsold did it not remain your own and after it was sold were not the proceeds at your disposal how is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart you did not lie to us
4758,ACT,5,NRSV,but to god
4759,ACT,5,NRSV,now when ananias heard these words he fell down and died and great fear seized all who heard of it
4760,ACT,5,NRSV,the young men came and wrapped up his body
4761,ACT,5,NRSV,then carried him out and buried him
4762,ACT,5,NRSV,after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened
4763,ACT,5,NRSV,peter said to her tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price and she said yes that was the price
4764,ACT,5,NRSV,then peter said to her how is it that you have agreed together to put the spirit of the lord to the test look the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out
4765,ACT,5,NRSV,immediately she fell down at his feet and died when the young men came in they found her dead so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband
4766,ACT,5,NRSV,and great fear seized the whole church and all who heard of these things
4767,ACT,5,NRSV,now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles and they were all together in solomons portico
4768,ACT,5,NRSV,none of the rest dared to join them but the people held them in high esteem
4769,ACT,5,NRSV,yet more than ever believers were added to the lord great numbers of both men and women
4770,ACT,5,NRSV,so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats in order that peters shadow might fall on some of them as he came by
4771,ACT,5,NRSV,a great number of people would also gather from the towns around jerusalem bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits and they were all cured
4772,ACT,5,NRSV,then the high priest took action he and all who were with him that is the sect of the sadducees being filled with jealousy
4773,ACT,5,NRSV,arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison
4774,ACT,5,NRSV,but during the night an angel of the lord opened the prison doors brought them out and said
4775,ACT,5,NRSV,go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life
4776,ACT,5,NRSV,when they heard this they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching
4777,ACT,5,NRSV,when the high priest and those with him arrived they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
4778,ACT,5,NRSV,but when the temple police went there they did not find them in the prison so they returned and reported
4779,ACT,5,NRSV,we found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside
4780,ACT,5,NRSV,now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were perplexed about them wondering what might be going on
4781,ACT,5,NRSV,then someone arrived and announced look the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
4782,ACT,5,NRSV,then the captain went with the temple police and brought them but without violence for they were afraid of being stoned by the people
4783,ACT,5,NRSV,when they had brought them they had them stand before the council the high priest questioned them
4784,ACT,5,NRSV,saying we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name
4785,ACT,5,NRSV,yet here you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this mans blood on us
4786,ACT,5,NRSV,but peter and the apostles answered we must obey god rather than any human authority
4787,ACT,5,NRSV,the god of our ancestors raised up jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree
4788,ACT,5,NRSV,god exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior that he might give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
4789,ACT,5,NRSV,and we are witnesses to these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
4790,ACT,5,NRSV,when they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them
4791,ACT,5,NRSV,but a pharisee in the council named gamaliel a teacher of the law respected by all the people stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time
4792,ACT,5,NRSV,then he said to them fellow israelites
4793,ACT,5,NRSV,consider carefully what you propose to do to these men
4794,ACT,5,NRSV,for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him but he was killed and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared
4795,ACT,5,NRSV,after him judas the galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him he also perished and all who followed him were scattered
4796,ACT,5,NRSV,so in the present case i tell you keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail
4797,ACT,5,NRSV,but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow themin that case you may even be found fighting against god
4798,ACT,5,NRSV,they were convinced by him
4799,ACT,5,NRSV,and when they had called in the apostles they had them flogged then they ordered them not to speak in the name of jesus and let them go
4800,ACT,5,NRSV,as they left the council they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name
4801,ACT,5,NRSV,and every day in the temple and at home
4802,ACT,5,NRSV,they did not cease to teach and proclaim jesus as the messiah
4803,ACT,6,NRSV,now during those days when the disciples were increasing in number the hellenists complained against the hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food
4804,ACT,6,NRSV,and the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said it is not right that we should neglect the word of god in order to wait on tables
4805,ACT,6,NRSV,therefore friends
4806,ACT,6,NRSV,select from among yourselves seven men of good standing full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint to this task
4807,ACT,6,NRSV,while we for our part will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word
4808,ACT,6,NRSV,what they said pleased the whole community and they chose stephen a man full of faith and the holy spirit together with philip prochorus nicanor timon parmenas and nicolaus a proselyte of antioch
4809,ACT,6,NRSV,they had these men stand before the apostles who prayed and laid their hands on them
4810,ACT,6,NRSV,the word of god continued to spread the number of the disciples increased greatly in jerusalem and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith
4811,ACT,6,NRSV,stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people
4812,ACT,6,NRSV,then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called cyrenians alexandrians and others of those from cilicia and asia stood up and argued with stephen
4813,ACT,6,NRSV,but they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit
4814,ACT,6,NRSV,with which he spoke
4815,ACT,6,NRSV,then they secretly instigated some men to say we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god
4816,ACT,6,NRSV,they stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes then they suddenly confronted him seized him and brought him before the council
4817,ACT,6,NRSV,they set up false witnesses who said this man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law
4818,ACT,6,NRSV,for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth
4819,ACT,6,NRSV,will destroy this place and will change the customs that moses handed on to us
4820,ACT,6,NRSV,and all who sat in the council looked intently at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel
4821,ACT,7,NRSV,then the high priest asked him are these things so
4822,ACT,7,NRSV,and stephen replied
4823,ACT,7,NRSV,brothers
4824,ACT,7,NRSV,and fathers listen to me the god of glory appeared to our ancestor abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he lived in haran
4825,ACT,7,NRSV,and said to him leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that i will show you
4826,ACT,7,NRSV,then he left the country of the chaldeans and settled in haran after his father died god had him move from there to this country in which you are now living
4827,ACT,7,NRSV,he did not give him any of it as a heritage not even a foots length but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him even though he had no child
4828,ACT,7,NRSV,and god spoke in these terms that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years
4829,ACT,7,NRSV,but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place
4830,ACT,7,NRSV,then he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham
4831,ACT,7,NRSV,became the father of isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day and isaac became the father of jacob and jacob of the twelve patriarchs
4832,ACT,7,NRSV,the patriarchs jealous of joseph sold him into egypt but god was with him
4833,ACT,7,NRSV,and rescued him from all his afflictions and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt who appointed him ruler over egypt and over all his household
4834,ACT,7,NRSV,now there came a famine throughout egypt and canaan and great suffering and our ancestors could find no food
4835,ACT,7,NRSV,but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent our ancestors there on their first visit
4836,ACT,7,NRSV,on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh
4837,ACT,7,NRSV,then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventyfive in all
4838,ACT,7,NRSV,so jacob went down to egypt he himself died there as well as our ancestors
4839,ACT,7,NRSV,and their bodies
4840,ACT,7,NRSV,were brought back to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem
4841,ACT,7,NRSV,but as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that god had made to abraham our people in egypt increased and multiplied
4842,ACT,7,NRSV,until another king who had not known joseph ruled over egypt
4843,ACT,7,NRSV,he dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die
4844,ACT,7,NRSV,at this time moses was born and he was beautiful before god for three months he was brought up in his fathers house
4845,ACT,7,NRSV,and when he was abandoned pharaohs daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son
4846,ACT,7,NRSV,so moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds
4847,ACT,7,NRSV,when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his relatives the israelites
4848,ACT,7,NRSV,when he saw one of them being wronged he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the egyptian
4849,ACT,7,NRSV,he supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that god through him was rescuing them but they did not understand
4850,ACT,7,NRSV,the next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them saying men you are brothers why do you wrong each other
4851,ACT,7,NRSV,but the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed moses
4852,ACT,7,NRSV,aside saying who made you a ruler and a judge over us
4853,ACT,7,NRSV,do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday
4854,ACT,7,NRSV,when he heard this moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of midian there he became the father of two sons
4855,ACT,7,NRSV,now when forty years had passed an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in the flame of a burning bush
4856,ACT,7,NRSV,when moses saw it he was amazed at the sight and as he approached to look there came the voice of the lord
4857,ACT,7,NRSV,i am the god of your ancestors the god of abraham isaac and jacob moses began to tremble and did not dare to look
4858,ACT,7,NRSV,then the lord said to him take off the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground
4859,ACT,7,NRSV,i have surely seen the mistreatment of my people who are in egypt and have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them come now i will send you to egypt
4860,ACT,7,NRSV,it was this moses whom they rejected when they said who made you a ruler and a judge and whom god now sent as both ruler and liberator through the angel who appeared to him in the bush
4861,ACT,7,NRSV,he led them out having performed wonders and signs in egypt at the red sea and in the wilderness for forty years
4862,ACT,7,NRSV,this is the moses who said to the israelites god will raise up a prophet for you from your own people
4863,ACT,7,NRSV,as he raised me up
4864,ACT,7,NRSV,he is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at mount sinai and with our ancestors and he received living oracles to give to us
4865,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors were unwilling to obey him instead they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to egypt
4866,ACT,7,NRSV,saying to aaron make gods for us who will lead the way for us as for this moses who led us out from the land of egypt we do not know what has happened to him
4867,ACT,7,NRSV,at that time they made a calf offered a sacrifice to the idol and reveled in the works of their hands
4868,ACT,7,NRSV,but god turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets
4869,ACT,7,NRSV,did you offer to me slain victims and sacrifices
4870,ACT,7,NRSV,forty years in the wilderness o house of israel
4871,ACT,7,NRSV,no you took along the tent of moloch
4872,ACT,7,NRSV,and the star of your god rephan
4873,ACT,7,NRSV,the images that you made to worship
4874,ACT,7,NRSV,so i will remove you beyond babylon
4875,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness as god
4876,ACT,7,NRSV,directed when he spoke to moses ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen
4877,ACT,7,NRSV,our ancestors in turn brought it in with joshua when they dispossessed the nations that god drove out before our ancestors and it was there until the time of david
4878,ACT,7,NRSV,who found favor with god and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of jacob
4879,ACT,7,NRSV,but it was solomon who built a house for him
4880,ACT,7,NRSV,yet the most high does not dwell in houses made with human hands
4881,ACT,7,NRSV,as the prophet says
4882,ACT,7,NRSV,heaven is my throne
4883,ACT,7,NRSV,and the earth is my footstool
4884,ACT,7,NRSV,what kind of house will you build for me says the lord
4885,ACT,7,NRSV,or what is the place of my rest
4886,ACT,7,NRSV,did not my hand make all these things
4887,ACT,7,NRSV,you stiffnecked people uncircumcised in heart and ears you are forever opposing the holy spirit just as your ancestors used to do
4888,ACT,7,NRSV,which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute they killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one and now you have become his betrayers and murderers
4889,ACT,7,NRSV,you are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels and yet you have not kept it
4890,ACT,7,NRSV,when they heard these things they became enraged and ground their teeth at stephen
4891,ACT,7,NRSV,but filled with the holy spirit he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god
4892,ACT,7,NRSV,look he said i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god
4893,ACT,7,NRSV,but they covered their ears and with a loud shout all rushed together against him
4894,ACT,7,NRSV,then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named saul
4895,ACT,7,NRSV,while they were stoning stephen he prayed lord jesus receive my spirit
4896,ACT,7,NRSV,then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them when he had said this he died
4897,ACT,8,NRSV,and saul approved of their killing him
4898,ACT,8,NRSV,that day a severe persecution began against the church in jerusalem and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of judea and samaria
4899,ACT,8,NRSV,devout men buried stephen and made loud lamentation over him
4900,ACT,8,NRSV,but saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house dragging off both men and women he committed them to prison
4901,ACT,8,NRSV,now those who were scattered went from place to place proclaiming the word
4902,ACT,8,NRSV,philip went down to the city
4903,ACT,8,NRSV,of samaria and proclaimed the messiah
4904,ACT,8,NRSV,to them
4905,ACT,8,NRSV,the crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by philip hearing and seeing the signs that he did
4906,ACT,8,NRSV,for unclean spirits crying with loud shrieks came out of many who were possessed and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured
4907,ACT,8,NRSV,so there was great joy in that city
4908,ACT,8,NRSV,now a certain man named simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of samaria saying that he was someone great
4909,ACT,8,NRSV,all of them from the least to the greatest listened to him eagerly saying this man is the power of god that is called great
4910,ACT,8,NRSV,and they listened eagerly to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic
4911,ACT,8,NRSV,but when they believed philip who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
4912,ACT,8,NRSV,even simon himself believed after being baptized he stayed constantly with philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place
4913,ACT,8,NRSV,now when the apostles at jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them
4914,ACT,8,NRSV,the two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit
4915,ACT,8,NRSV,for as yet the spirit had not come
4916,ACT,8,NRSV,upon any of them they had only been baptized in the name of the lord jesus
4917,ACT,8,NRSV,then peter and john
4918,ACT,8,NRSV,laid their hands on them and they received the holy spirit
4919,ACT,8,NRSV,now when simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money
4920,ACT,8,NRSV,saying give me also this power so that anyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit
4921,ACT,8,NRSV,but peter said to him may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain gods gift with money
4922,ACT,8,NRSV,you have no part or share in this for your heart is not right before god
4923,ACT,8,NRSV,repent therefore of this wickedness of yours and pray to the lord that if possible the intent of your heart may be forgiven you
4924,ACT,8,NRSV,for i see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness
4925,ACT,8,NRSV,simon answered pray for me to the lord that nothing of what you
4926,ACT,8,NRSV,have said may happen to me
4927,ACT,8,NRSV,now after peter and john
4928,ACT,8,NRSV,had testified and spoken the word of the lord they returned to jerusalem proclaiming the good news to many villages of the samaritans
4929,ACT,8,NRSV,then an angel of the lord said to philip get up and go toward the south
4930,ACT,8,NRSV,to the road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza this is a wilderness road
4931,ACT,8,NRSV,so he got up and went now there was an ethiopian eunuch a court official of the candace queen of the ethiopians in charge of her entire treasury he had come to jerusalem to worship
4932,ACT,8,NRSV,and was returning home seated in his chariot he was reading the prophet isaiah
4933,ACT,8,NRSV,then the spirit said to philip go over to this chariot and join it
4934,ACT,8,NRSV,so philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet isaiah he asked do you understand what you are reading
4935,ACT,8,NRSV,he replied how can i unless someone guides me and he invited philip to get in and sit beside him
4936,ACT,8,NRSV,now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this
4937,ACT,8,NRSV,like a sheep he was led to the slaughter
4938,ACT,8,NRSV,and like a lamb silent before its shearer
4939,ACT,8,NRSV,so he does not open his mouth
4940,ACT,8,NRSV,in his humiliation justice was denied him
4941,ACT,8,NRSV,who can describe his generation
4942,ACT,8,NRSV,for his life is taken away from the earth
4943,ACT,8,NRSV,the eunuch asked philip about whom may i ask you does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else
4944,ACT,8,NRSV,then philip began to speak and starting with this scripture he proclaimed to him the good news about jesus
4945,ACT,8,NRSV,as they were going along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said look here is water what is to prevent me from being baptized
4946,ACT,8,NRSV,he commanded the chariot to stop and both of them philip and the eunuch went down into the water and philip
4947,ACT,8,NRSV,baptized him
4948,ACT,8,NRSV,when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord snatched philip away the eunuch saw him no more and went on his way rejoicing
4949,ACT,8,NRSV,but philip found himself at azotus and as he was passing through the region he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to caesarea
4950,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the lord went to the high priest
4951,ACT,9,NRSV,and asked him for letters to the synagogues at damascus so that if he found any who belonged to the way men or women he might bring them bound to jerusalem
4952,ACT,9,NRSV,now as he was going along and approaching damascus suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
4953,ACT,9,NRSV,he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why do you persecute me
4954,ACT,9,NRSV,he asked who are you lord the reply came i am jesus whom you are persecuting
4955,ACT,9,NRSV,but get up and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do
4956,ACT,9,NRSV,the men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one
4957,ACT,9,NRSV,saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus
4958,ACT,9,NRSV,for three days he was without sight and neither ate nor drank
4959,ACT,9,NRSV,now there was a disciple in damascus named ananias the lord said to him in a vision ananias he answered here i am lord
4960,ACT,9,NRSV,the lord said to him get up and go to the street called straight and at the house of judas look for a man of tarsus named saul at this moment he is praying
4961,ACT,9,NRSV,and he has seen in a vision
4962,ACT,9,NRSV,a man named ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight
4963,ACT,9,NRSV,but ananias answered lord i have heard from many about this man how much evil he has done to your saints in jerusalem
4964,ACT,9,NRSV,and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name
4965,ACT,9,NRSV,but the lord said to him go for he is an instrument whom i have chosen to bring my name before gentiles and kings and before the people of israel
4966,ACT,9,NRSV,i myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name
4967,ACT,9,NRSV,so ananias went and entered the house he laid his hands on saul
4968,ACT,9,NRSV,and said brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on your way here has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the holy spirit
4969,ACT,9,NRSV,and immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and his sight was restored then he got up and was baptized
4970,ACT,9,NRSV,and after taking some food he regained his strength
4971,ACT,9,NRSV,for several days he was with the disciples in damascus
4972,ACT,9,NRSV,and immediately he began to proclaim jesus in the synagogues saying he is the son of god
4973,ACT,9,NRSV,all who heard him were amazed and said is not this the man who made havoc in jerusalem among those who invoked this name and has he not come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests
4974,ACT,9,NRSV,saul became increasingly more powerful and confounded the jews who lived in damascus by proving that jesus
4975,ACT,9,NRSV,was the messiah
4976,ACT,9,NRSV,after some time had passed the jews plotted to kill him
4977,ACT,9,NRSV,but their plot became known to saul they were watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him
4978,ACT,9,NRSV,but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall
4979,ACT,9,NRSV,lowering him in a basket
4980,ACT,9,NRSV,when he had come to jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples and they were all afraid of him for they did not believe that he was a disciple
4981,ACT,9,NRSV,but barnabas took him brought him to the apostles and described for them how on the road he had seen the lord who had spoken to him and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of jesus
4982,ACT,9,NRSV,so he went in and out among them in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord
4983,ACT,9,NRSV,he spoke and argued with the hellenists but they were attempting to kill him
4984,ACT,9,NRSV,when the believers
4985,ACT,9,NRSV,learned of it they brought him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus
4986,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile the church throughout judea galilee and samaria had peace and was built up living in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit it increased in numbers
4987,ACT,9,NRSV,now as peter went here and there among all the believers
4988,ACT,9,NRSV,he came down also to the saints living in lydda
4989,ACT,9,NRSV,there he found a man named aeneas who had been bedridden for eight years for he was paralyzed
4990,ACT,9,NRSV,peter said to him aeneas jesus christ heals you get up and make your bed and immediately he got up
4991,ACT,9,NRSV,and all the residents of lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord
4992,ACT,9,NRSV,now in joppa there was a disciple whose name was tabitha which in greek is dorcas
4993,ACT,9,NRSV,she was devoted to good works and acts of charity
4994,ACT,9,NRSV,at that time she became ill and died when they had washed her they laid her in a room upstairs
4995,ACT,9,NRSV,since lydda was near joppa the disciples who heard that peter was there sent two men to him with the request please come to us without delay
4996,ACT,9,NRSV,so peter got up and went with them and when he arrived they took him to the room upstairs all the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that dorcas had made while she was with them
4997,ACT,9,NRSV,peter put all of them outside and then he knelt down and prayed he turned to the body and said tabitha get up then she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up
4998,ACT,9,NRSV,he gave her his hand and helped her up then calling the saints and widows he showed her to be alive
4999,ACT,9,NRSV,this became known throughout joppa and many believed in the lord
5000,ACT,9,NRSV,meanwhile he stayed in joppa for some time with a certain simon a tanner
5001,ACT,10,NRSV,in caesarea there was a man named cornelius a centurion of the italian cohort as it was called
5002,ACT,10,NRSV,he was a devout man who feared god with all his household he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to god
5003,ACT,10,NRSV,one afternoon at about three oclock he had a vision in which he clearly saw an angel of god coming in and saying to him cornelius
5004,ACT,10,NRSV,he stared at him in terror and said what is it lord he answered your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before god
5005,ACT,10,NRSV,now send men to joppa for a certain simon who is called peter
5006,ACT,10,NRSV,he is lodging with simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside
5007,ACT,10,NRSV,when the angel who spoke to him had left he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him
5008,ACT,10,NRSV,and after telling them everything he sent them to joppa
5009,ACT,10,NRSV,about noon the next day as they were on their journey and approaching the city peter went up on the roof to pray
5010,ACT,10,NRSV,he became hungry and wanted something to eat and while it was being prepared he fell into a trance
5011,ACT,10,NRSV,he saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down being lowered to the ground by its four corners
5012,ACT,10,NRSV,in it were all kinds of fourfooted creatures and reptiles and birds of the air
5013,ACT,10,NRSV,then he heard a voice saying get up peter kill and eat
5014,ACT,10,NRSV,but peter said by no means lord for i have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean
5015,ACT,10,NRSV,the voice said to him again a second time what god has made clean you must not call profane
5016,ACT,10,NRSV,this happened three times and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven
5017,ACT,10,NRSV,now while peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen suddenly the men sent by cornelius appeared they were asking for simons house and were standing by the gate
5018,ACT,10,NRSV,they called out to ask whether simon who was called peter was staying there
5019,ACT,10,NRSV,while peter was still thinking about the vision the spirit said to him look three
5020,ACT,10,NRSV,men are searching for you
5021,ACT,10,NRSV,now get up go down and go with them without hesitation for i have sent them
5022,ACT,10,NRSV,so peter went down to the men and said i am the one you are looking for what is the reason for your coming
5023,ACT,10,NRSV,they answered cornelius a centurion an upright and godfearing man who is well spoken of by the whole jewish nation was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say
5024,ACT,10,NRSV,so peter
5025,ACT,10,NRSV,invited them in and gave them lodging
5026,ACT,10,NRSV,the next day he got up and went with them and some of the believers
5027,ACT,10,NRSV,from joppa accompanied him
5028,ACT,10,NRSV,the following day they came to caesarea cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends
5029,ACT,10,NRSV,on peters arrival cornelius met him and falling at his feet worshiped him
5030,ACT,10,NRSV,but peter made him get up saying stand up i am only a mortal
5031,ACT,10,NRSV,and as he talked with him he went in and found that many had assembled
5032,ACT,10,NRSV,and he said to them you yourselves know that it is unlawful for a jew to associate with or to visit a gentile but god has shown me that i should not call anyone profane or unclean
5033,ACT,10,NRSV,so when i was sent for i came without objection now may i ask why you sent for me
5034,ACT,10,NRSV,cornelius replied four days ago at this very hour at three oclock i was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me
5035,ACT,10,NRSV,he said cornelius your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before god
5036,ACT,10,NRSV,send therefore to joppa and ask for simon who is called peter he is staying in the home of simon a tanner by the sea
5037,ACT,10,NRSV,therefore i sent for you immediately and you have been kind enough to come so now all of us are here in the presence of god to listen to all that the lord has commanded you to say
5038,ACT,10,NRSV,then peter began to speak to them i truly understand that god shows no partiality
5039,ACT,10,NRSV,but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him
5040,ACT,10,NRSV,you know the message he sent to the people of israel preaching peace by jesus christhe is lord of all
5041,ACT,10,NRSV,that message spread throughout judea beginning in galilee after the baptism that john announced
5042,ACT,10,NRSV,how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for god was with him
5043,ACT,10,NRSV,we are witnesses to all that he did both in judea and in jerusalem they put him to death by hanging him on a tree
5044,ACT,10,NRSV,but god raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear
5045,ACT,10,NRSV,not to all the people but to us who were chosen by god as witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead
5046,ACT,10,NRSV,he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by god as judge of the living and the dead
5047,ACT,10,NRSV,all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name
5048,ACT,10,NRSV,while peter was still speaking the holy spirit fell upon all who heard the word
5049,ACT,10,NRSV,the circumcised believers who had come with peter were astounded that the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on the gentiles
5050,ACT,10,NRSV,for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling god then peter said
5051,ACT,10,NRSV,can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the holy spirit just as we have
5052,ACT,10,NRSV,so he ordered them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ then they invited him to stay for several days
5053,ACT,11,NRSV,now the apostles and the believers
5054,ACT,11,NRSV,who were in judea heard that the gentiles had also accepted the word of god
5055,ACT,11,NRSV,so when peter went up to jerusalem the circumcised believers
5056,ACT,11,NRSV,criticized him
5057,ACT,11,NRSV,saying why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them
5058,ACT,11,NRSV,then peter began to explain it to them step by step saying
5059,ACT,11,NRSV,i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision there was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven being lowered by its four corners and it came close to me
5060,ACT,11,NRSV,as i looked at it closely i saw fourfooted animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air
5061,ACT,11,NRSV,i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat
5062,ACT,11,NRSV,but i replied by no means lord for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth
5063,ACT,11,NRSV,but a second time the voice answered from heaven what god has made clean you must not call profane
5064,ACT,11,NRSV,this happened three times then everything was pulled up again to heaven
5065,ACT,11,NRSV,at that very moment three men sent to me from caesarea arrived at the house where we were
5066,ACT,11,NRSV,the spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us
5067,ACT,11,NRSV,these six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the mans house
5068,ACT,11,NRSV,he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and bring simon who is called peter
5069,ACT,11,NRSV,he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved
5070,ACT,11,NRSV,and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning
5071,ACT,11,NRSV,and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit
5072,ACT,11,NRSV,if then god gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i could hinder god
5073,ACT,11,NRSV,when they heard this they were silenced and they praised god saying then god has given even to the gentiles the repentance that leads to life
5074,ACT,11,NRSV,now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over stephen traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch and they spoke the word to no one except jews
5075,ACT,11,NRSV,but among them were some men of cyprus and cyrene who on coming to antioch spoke to the hellenists
5076,ACT,11,NRSV,also proclaiming the lord jesus
5077,ACT,11,NRSV,the hand of the lord was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord
5078,ACT,11,NRSV,news of this came to the ears of the church in jerusalem and they sent barnabas to antioch
5079,ACT,11,NRSV,when he came and saw the grace of god he rejoiced and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the lord with steadfast devotion
5080,ACT,11,NRSV,for he was a good man full of the holy spirit and of faith and a great many people were brought to the lord
5081,ACT,11,NRSV,then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul
5082,ACT,11,NRSV,and when he had found him he brought him to antioch so it was that for an entire year they met with
5083,ACT,11,NRSV,the church and taught a great many people and it was in antioch that the disciples were first called christians
5084,ACT,11,NRSV,at that time prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch
5085,ACT,11,NRSV,one of them named agabus stood up and predicted by the spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world and this took place during the reign of claudius
5086,ACT,11,NRSV,the disciples determined that according to their ability each would send relief to the believers
5087,ACT,11,NRSV,living in judea
5088,ACT,11,NRSV,this they did sending it to the elders by barnabas and saul
5089,ACT,12,NRSV,about that time king herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church
5090,ACT,12,NRSV,he had james the brother of john killed with the sword
5091,ACT,12,NRSV,after he saw that it pleased the jews he proceeded to arrest peter also this was during the festival of unleavened bread
5092,ACT,12,NRSV,when he had seized him he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him intending to bring him out to the people after the passover
5093,ACT,12,NRSV,while peter was kept in prison the church prayed fervently to god for him
5094,ACT,12,NRSV,the very night before herod was going to bring him out peter bound with two chains was sleeping between two soldiers while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison
5095,ACT,12,NRSV,suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell he tapped peter on the side and woke him saying get up quickly and the chains fell off his wrists
5096,ACT,12,NRSV,the angel said to him fasten your belt and put on your sandals he did so then he said to him wrap your cloak around you and follow me
5097,ACT,12,NRSV,peter
5098,ACT,12,NRSV,went out and followed him he did not realize that what was happening with the angels help was real he thought he was seeing a vision
5099,ACT,12,NRSV,after they had passed the first and the second guard they came before the iron gate leading into the city it opened for them of its own accord and they went outside and walked along a lane when suddenly the angel left him
5100,ACT,12,NRSV,then peter came to himself and said now i am sure that the lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of herod and from all that the jewish people were expecting
5101,ACT,12,NRSV,as soon as he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john whose other name was mark where many had gathered and were praying
5102,ACT,12,NRSV,when he knocked at the outer gate a maid named rhoda came to answer
5103,ACT,12,NRSV,on recognizing peters voice she was so overjoyed that instead of opening the gate she ran in and announced that peter was standing at the gate
5104,ACT,12,NRSV,they said to her you are out of your mind but she insisted that it was so they said it is his angel
5105,ACT,12,NRSV,meanwhile peter continued knocking and when they opened the gate they saw him and were amazed
5106,ACT,12,NRSV,he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and described for them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he added tell this to james and to the believers
5107,ACT,12,NRSV,then he left and went to another place
5108,ACT,12,NRSV,when morning came there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of peter
5109,ACT,12,NRSV,when herod had searched for him and could not find him he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death then he went down from judea to caesarea and stayed there
5110,ACT,12,NRSV,now herod
5111,ACT,12,NRSV,was angry with the people of tyre and sidon so they came to him in a body and after winning over blastus the kings chamberlain they asked for a reconciliation because their country depended on the kings country for food
5112,ACT,12,NRSV,on an appointed day herod put on his royal robes took his seat on the platform and delivered a public address to them
5113,ACT,12,NRSV,the people kept shouting the voice of a god and not of a mortal
5114,ACT,12,NRSV,and immediately because he had not given the glory to god an angel of the lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died
5115,ACT,12,NRSV,but the word of god continued to advance and gain adherents
5116,ACT,12,NRSV,then after completing their mission barnabas and saul returned to
5117,ACT,12,NRSV,jerusalem and brought with them john whose other name was mark
5118,ACT,13,NRSV,now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon who was called niger lucius of cyrene manaen a member of the court of herod the ruler
5119,ACT,13,NRSV,and saul
5120,ACT,13,NRSV,while they were worshiping the lord and fasting the holy spirit said set apart for me barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them
5121,ACT,13,NRSV,then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off
5122,ACT,13,NRSV,so being sent out by the holy spirit they went down to seleucia and from there they sailed to cyprus
5123,ACT,13,NRSV,when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had john also to assist them
5124,ACT,13,NRSV,when they had gone through the whole island as far as paphos they met a certain magician a jewish false prophet named barjesus
5125,ACT,13,NRSV,he was with the proconsul sergius paulus an intelligent man who summoned barnabas and saul and wanted to hear the word of god
5126,ACT,13,NRSV,but the magician elymas for that is the translation of his name opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith
5127,ACT,13,NRSV,but saul also known as paul filled with the holy spirit looked intently at him
5128,ACT,13,NRSV,and said you son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness full of all deceit and villainy will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the lord
5129,ACT,13,NRSV,and now listenthe hand of the lord is against you and you will be blind for a while unable to see the sun immediately mist and darkness came over him and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand
5130,ACT,13,NRSV,when the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was astonished at the teaching about the lord
5131,ACT,13,NRSV,then paul and his companions set sail from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia john however left them and returned to jerusalem
5132,ACT,13,NRSV,but they went on from perga and came to antioch in pisidia and on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down
5133,ACT,13,NRSV,after the reading of the law and the prophets the officials of the synagogue sent them a message saying brothers if you have any word of exhortation for the people give it
5134,ACT,13,NRSV,so paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak
5135,ACT,13,NRSV,you israelites
5136,ACT,13,NRSV,and others who fear god listen
5137,ACT,13,NRSV,the god of this people israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of egypt and with uplifted arm he led them out of it
5138,ACT,13,NRSV,for about forty years he put up with
5139,ACT,13,NRSV,them in the wilderness
5140,ACT,13,NRSV,after he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance
5141,ACT,13,NRSV,for about four hundred fifty years after that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet samuel
5142,ACT,13,NRSV,then they asked for a king and god gave them saul son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin who reigned for forty years
5143,ACT,13,NRSV,when he had removed him he made david their king in his testimony about him he said i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who will carry out all my wishes
5144,ACT,13,NRSV,of this mans posterity god has brought to israel a savior jesus as he promised
5145,ACT,13,NRSV,before his coming john had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
5146,ACT,13,NRSV,and as john was finishing his work he said what do you suppose that i am i am not he no but one is coming after me i am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals
5147,ACT,13,NRSV,on his feet
5148,ACT,13,NRSV,my brothers you descendants of abrahams family and others who fear god to us
5149,ACT,13,NRSV,the message of this salvation has been sent
5150,ACT,13,NRSV,because the residents of jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath they fulfilled those words by condemning him
5151,ACT,13,NRSV,even though they found no cause for a sentence of death they asked pilate to have him killed
5152,ACT,13,NRSV,when they had carried out everything that was written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb
5153,ACT,13,NRSV,but god raised him from the dead
5154,ACT,13,NRSV,and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from galilee to jerusalem and they are now his witnesses to the people
5155,ACT,13,NRSV,and we bring you the good news that what god promised to our ancestors
5156,ACT,13,NRSV,he has fulfilled for us their children by raising jesus as also it is written in the second psalm
5157,ACT,13,NRSV,you are my son
5158,ACT,13,NRSV,today i have begotten you
5159,ACT,13,NRSV,as to his raising him from the dead no more to return to corruption he has spoken in this way
5160,ACT,13,NRSV,i will give you the holy promises made to david
5161,ACT,13,NRSV,therefore he has also said in another psalm
5162,ACT,13,NRSV,you will not let your holy one experience corruption
5163,ACT,13,NRSV,for david after he had served the purpose of god in his own generation died
5164,ACT,13,NRSV,was laid beside his ancestors and experienced corruption
5165,ACT,13,NRSV,but he whom god raised up experienced no corruption
5166,ACT,13,NRSV,let it be known to you therefore my brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you
5167,ACT,13,NRSV,by this jesus
5168,ACT,13,NRSV,everyone who believes is set free from all those sins
5169,ACT,13,NRSV,from which you could not be freed by the law of moses
5170,ACT,13,NRSV,beware therefore that what the prophets said does not happen to you
5171,ACT,13,NRSV,look you scoffers
5172,ACT,13,NRSV,be amazed and perish
5173,ACT,13,NRSV,for in your days i am doing a work
5174,ACT,13,NRSV,a work that you will never believe even if someone tells you
5175,ACT,13,NRSV,as paul and barnabas
5176,ACT,13,NRSV,were going out the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath
5177,ACT,13,NRSV,when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god
5178,ACT,13,NRSV,the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord
5179,ACT,13,NRSV,but when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy and blaspheming they contradicted what was spoken by paul
5180,ACT,13,NRSV,then both paul and barnabas spoke out boldly saying it was necessary that the word of god should be spoken first to you since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life we are now turning to the gentiles
5181,ACT,13,NRSV,for so the lord has commanded us saying
5182,ACT,13,NRSV,i have set you to be a light for the gentiles
5183,ACT,13,NRSV,so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth
5184,ACT,13,NRSV,when the gentiles heard this they were glad and praised the word of the lord and as many as had been destined for eternal life became believers
5185,ACT,13,NRSV,thus the word of the lord spread throughout the region
5186,ACT,13,NRSV,but the jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city and stirred up persecution against paul and barnabas and drove them out of their region
5187,ACT,13,NRSV,so they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to iconium
5188,ACT,13,NRSV,and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit
5189,ACT,14,NRSV,the same thing occurred in iconium where paul and barnabas
5190,ACT,14,NRSV,went into the jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both jews and greeks became believers
5191,ACT,14,NRSV,but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers
5192,ACT,14,NRSV,so they remained for a long time speaking boldly for the lord who testified to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through them
5193,ACT,14,NRSV,but the residents of the city were divided some sided with the jews and some with the apostles
5194,ACT,14,NRSV,and when an attempt was made by both gentiles and jews with their rulers to mistreat them and to stone them
5195,ACT,14,NRSV,the apostles
5196,ACT,14,NRSV,learned of it and fled to lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and to the surrounding country
5197,ACT,14,NRSV,and there they continued proclaiming the good news
5198,ACT,14,NRSV,in lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet and had never walked for he had been crippled from birth
5199,ACT,14,NRSV,he listened to paul as he was speaking and paul looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed
5200,ACT,14,NRSV,said in a loud voice stand upright on your feet and the man
5201,ACT,14,NRSV,sprang up and began to walk
5202,ACT,14,NRSV,when the crowds saw what paul had done they shouted in the lycaonian language the gods have come down to us in human form
5203,ACT,14,NRSV,barnabas they called zeus and paul they called hermes because he was the chief speaker
5204,ACT,14,NRSV,the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city
5205,ACT,14,NRSV,brought oxen and garlands to the gates he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice
5206,ACT,14,NRSV,when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of it they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd shouting
5207,ACT,14,NRSV,friends
5208,ACT,14,NRSV,why are you doing this we are mortals just like you and we bring you good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them
5209,ACT,14,NRSV,in past generations he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways
5210,ACT,14,NRSV,yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing goodgiving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy
5211,ACT,14,NRSV,even with these words they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them
5212,ACT,14,NRSV,but jews came there from antioch and iconium and won over the crowds then they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead
5213,ACT,14,NRSV,but when the disciples surrounded him he got up and went into the city the next day he went on with barnabas to derbe
5214,ACT,14,NRSV,after they had proclaimed the good news to that city and had made many disciples they returned to lystra then on to iconium and antioch
5215,ACT,14,NRSV,there they strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith saying it is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of god
5216,ACT,14,NRSV,and after they had appointed elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had come to believe
5217,ACT,14,NRSV,then they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia
5218,ACT,14,NRSV,when they had spoken the word in perga they went down to attalia
5219,ACT,14,NRSV,from there they sailed back to antioch where they had been commended to the grace of god for the work
5220,ACT,14,NRSV,that they had completed
5221,ACT,14,NRSV,when they arrived they called the church together and related all that god had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles
5222,ACT,14,NRSV,and they stayed there with the disciples for some time
5223,ACT,15,NRSV,then certain individuals came down from judea and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved
5224,ACT,15,NRSV,and after paul and barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them paul and barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders
5225,ACT,15,NRSV,so they were sent on their way by the church and as they passed through both phoenicia and samaria they reported the conversion of the gentiles and brought great joy to all the believers
5226,ACT,15,NRSV,when they came to jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they reported all that god had done with them
5227,ACT,15,NRSV,but some believers who belonged to the sect of the pharisees stood up and said it is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of moses
5228,ACT,15,NRSV,the apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter
5229,ACT,15,NRSV,after there had been much debate peter stood up and said to them my brothers
5230,ACT,15,NRSV,you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that i should be the one through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers
5231,ACT,15,NRSV,and god who knows the human heart testified to them by giving them the holy spirit just as he did to us
5232,ACT,15,NRSV,and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us
5233,ACT,15,NRSV,now therefore why are you putting god to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear
5234,ACT,15,NRSV,on the contrary we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the lord jesus just as they will
5235,ACT,15,NRSV,the whole assembly kept silence and listened to barnabas and paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that god had done through them among the gentiles
5236,ACT,15,NRSV,after they finished speaking james replied my brothers
5237,ACT,15,NRSV,listen to me
5238,ACT,15,NRSV,simeon has related how god first looked favorably on the gentiles to take from among them a people for his name
5239,ACT,15,NRSV,this agrees with the words of the prophets as it is written
5240,ACT,15,NRSV,after this i will return
5241,ACT,15,NRSV,and i will rebuild the dwelling of david which has fallen
5242,ACT,15,NRSV,from its ruins i will rebuild it
5243,ACT,15,NRSV,and i will set it up
5244,ACT,15,NRSV,so that all other peoples may seek the lord
5245,ACT,15,NRSV,even all the gentiles over whom my name has been called
5246,ACT,15,NRSV,thus says the lord who has been making these things
5247,ACT,15,NRSV,known from long ago
5248,ACT,15,NRSV,therefore i have reached the decision that we should not trouble those gentiles who are turning to god
5249,ACT,15,NRSV,but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled
5250,ACT,15,NRSV,and from blood
5251,ACT,15,NRSV,for in every city for generations past moses has had those who proclaim him for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues
5252,ACT,15,NRSV,then the apostles and the elders with the consent of the whole church decided to choose men from among their members
5253,ACT,15,NRSV,and to send them to antioch with paul and barnabas they sent judas called barsabbas and silas leaders among the brothers
5254,ACT,15,NRSV,with the following letter the brothers both the apostles and the elders to the believers
5255,ACT,15,NRSV,of gentile origin in antioch and syria and cilicia greetings
5256,ACT,15,NRSV,since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us though with no instructions from us have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds
5257,ACT,15,NRSV,we have decided unanimously to choose representatives
5258,ACT,15,NRSV,and send them to you along with our beloved barnabas and paul
5259,ACT,15,NRSV,who have risked their lives for the sake of our lord jesus christ
5260,ACT,15,NRSV,we have therefore sent judas and silas who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth
5261,ACT,15,NRSV,for it has seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials
5262,ACT,15,NRSV,that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled
5263,ACT,15,NRSV,and from fornication if you keep yourselves from these you will do well farewell
5264,ACT,15,NRSV,so they were sent off and went down to antioch when they gathered the congregation together they delivered the letter
5265,ACT,15,NRSV,when its members
5266,ACT,15,NRSV,read it they rejoiced at the exhortation
5267,ACT,15,NRSV,judas and silas who were themselves prophets said much to encourage and strengthen the believers
5268,ACT,15,NRSV,after they had been there for some time they were sent off in peace by the believers
5269,ACT,15,NRSV,to those who had sent them
5270,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul and barnabas remained in antioch and there with many others they taught and proclaimed the word of the lord
5271,ACT,15,NRSV,after some days paul said to barnabas come let us return and visit the believers
5272,ACT,15,NRSV,in every city where we proclaimed the word of the lord and see how they are doing
5273,ACT,15,NRSV,barnabas wanted to take with them john called mark
5274,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work
5275,ACT,15,NRSV,the disagreement became so sharp that they parted company barnabas took mark with him and sailed away to cyprus
5276,ACT,15,NRSV,but paul chose silas and set out the believers
5277,ACT,15,NRSV,commending him to the grace of the lord
5278,ACT,15,NRSV,he went through syria and cilicia strengthening the churches
5279,ACT,16,NRSV,paul
5280,ACT,16,NRSV,went on also to derbe and to lystra where there was a disciple named timothy the son of a jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a greek
5281,ACT,16,NRSV,he was well spoken of by the believers
5282,ACT,16,NRSV,in lystra and iconium
5283,ACT,16,NRSV,paul wanted timothy to accompany him and he took him and had him circumcised because of the jews who were in those places for they all knew that his father was a greek
5284,ACT,16,NRSV,as they went from town to town they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem
5285,ACT,16,NRSV,so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily
5286,ACT,16,NRSV,they went through the region of phrygia and galatia having been forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in asia
5287,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had come opposite mysia they attempted to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus did not allow them
5288,ACT,16,NRSV,so passing by mysia they went down to troas
5289,ACT,16,NRSV,during the night paul had a vision there stood a man of macedonia pleading with him and saying come over to macedonia and help us
5290,ACT,16,NRSV,when he had seen the vision we immediately tried to cross over to macedonia being convinced that god had called us to proclaim the good news to them
5291,ACT,16,NRSV,we set sail from troas and took a straight course to samothrace the following day to neapolis
5292,ACT,16,NRSV,and from there to philippi which is a leading city of the district
5293,ACT,16,NRSV,of macedonia and a roman colony we remained in this city for some days
5294,ACT,16,NRSV,on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river where we supposed there was a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there
5295,ACT,16,NRSV,a certain woman named lydia a worshiper of god was listening to us she was from the city of thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth the lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by paul
5296,ACT,16,NRSV,when she and her household were baptized she urged us saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come and stay at my home and she prevailed upon us
5297,ACT,16,NRSV,one day as we were going to the place of prayer we met a slavegirl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortunetelling
5298,ACT,16,NRSV,while she followed paul and us she would cry out these men are slaves of the most high god who proclaim to you
5299,ACT,16,NRSV,a way of salvation
5300,ACT,16,NRSV,she kept doing this for many days but paul very much annoyed turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and it came out that very hour
5301,ACT,16,NRSV,but when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities
5302,ACT,16,NRSV,when they had brought them before the magistrates they said these men are disturbing our city they are jews
5303,ACT,16,NRSV,and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as romans to adopt or observe
5304,ACT,16,NRSV,the crowd joined in attacking them and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods
5305,ACT,16,NRSV,after they had given them a severe flogging they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely
5306,ACT,16,NRSV,following these instructions he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks
5307,ACT,16,NRSV,about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them
5308,ACT,16,NRSV,suddenly there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyones chains were unfastened
5309,ACT,16,NRSV,when the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped
5310,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul shouted in a loud voice do not harm yourself for we are all here
5311,ACT,16,NRSV,the jailer
5312,ACT,16,NRSV,called for lights and rushing in he fell down trembling before paul and silas
5313,ACT,16,NRSV,then he brought them outside and said sirs what must i do to be saved
5314,ACT,16,NRSV,they answered believe on the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household
5315,ACT,16,NRSV,they spoke the word of the lord
5316,ACT,16,NRSV,to him and to all who were in his house
5317,ACT,16,NRSV,at the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds then he and his entire family were baptized without delay
5318,ACT,16,NRSV,he brought them up into the house and set food before them and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in god
5319,ACT,16,NRSV,when morning came the magistrates sent the police saying let those men go
5320,ACT,16,NRSV,and the jailer reported the message to paul saying the magistrates sent word to let you go therefore come out now and go in peace
5321,ACT,16,NRSV,but paul replied they have beaten us in public uncondemned men who are roman citizens and have thrown us into prison and now are they going to discharge us in secret certainly not let them come and take us out themselves
5322,ACT,16,NRSV,the police reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were roman citizens
5323,ACT,16,NRSV,so they came and apologized to them and they took them out and asked them to leave the city
5324,ACT,16,NRSV,after leaving the prison they went to lydias home and when they had seen and encouraged the brothers and sisters
5325,ACT,16,NRSV,there they departed
5326,ACT,17,NRSV,after paul and silas
5327,ACT,17,NRSV,had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews
5328,ACT,17,NRSV,and paul went in as was his custom and on three sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures
5329,ACT,17,NRSV,explaining and proving that it was necessary for the messiah
5330,ACT,17,NRSV,to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying this is the messiah
5331,ACT,17,NRSV,jesus whom i am proclaiming to you
5332,ACT,17,NRSV,some of them were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a great many of the devout greeks and not a few of the leading women
5333,ACT,17,NRSV,but the jews became jealous and with the help of some ruffians in the marketplaces they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar while they were searching for paul and silas to bring them out to the assembly they attacked jasons house
5334,ACT,17,NRSV,when they could not find them they dragged jason and some believers
5335,ACT,17,NRSV,before the city authorities
5336,ACT,17,NRSV,shouting these people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also
5337,ACT,17,NRSV,and jason has entertained them as guests they are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor saying that there is another king named jesus
5338,ACT,17,NRSV,the people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this
5339,ACT,17,NRSV,and after they had taken bail from jason and the others they let them go
5340,ACT,17,NRSV,that very night the believers
5341,ACT,17,NRSV,sent paul and silas off to beroea and when they arrived they went to the jewish synagogue
5342,ACT,17,NRSV,these jews were more receptive than those in thessalonica for they welcomed the message very eagerly and examined the scriptures every day to see whether these things were so
5343,ACT,17,NRSV,many of them therefore believed including not a few greek women and men of high standing
5344,ACT,17,NRSV,but when the jews of thessalonica learned that the word of god had been proclaimed by paul in beroea as well they came there too to stir up and incite the crowds
5345,ACT,17,NRSV,then the believers
5346,ACT,17,NRSV,immediately sent paul away to the coast but silas and timothy remained behind
5347,ACT,17,NRSV,those who conducted paul brought him as far as athens and after receiving instructions to have silas and timothy join him as soon as possible they left him
5348,ACT,17,NRSV,while paul was waiting for them in athens he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols
5349,ACT,17,NRSV,so he argued in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons and also in the marketplace
5350,ACT,17,NRSV,every day with those who happened to be there
5351,ACT,17,NRSV,also some epicurean and stoic philosophers debated with him some said what does this babbler want to say others said he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities this was because he was telling the good news about jesus and the resurrection
5352,ACT,17,NRSV,so they took him and brought him to the areopagus and asked him may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting
5353,ACT,17,NRSV,it sounds rather strange to us so we would like to know what it means
5354,ACT,17,NRSV,now all the athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new
5355,ACT,17,NRSV,then paul stood in front of the areopagus and said athenians i see how extremely religious you are in every way
5356,ACT,17,NRSV,for as i went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship i found among them an altar with the inscription to an unknown god what therefore you worship as unknown this i proclaim to you
5357,ACT,17,NRSV,the god who made the world and everything in it he who is lord of heaven and earth does not live in shrines made by human hands
5358,ACT,17,NRSV,nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things
5359,ACT,17,NRSV,from one ancestor
5360,ACT,17,NRSV,he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live
5361,ACT,17,NRSV,so that they would search for god
5362,ACT,17,NRSV,and perhaps grope for him and find himthough indeed he is not far from each one of us
5363,ACT,17,NRSV,for in him we live and move and have our being as even some of your own poets have said
5364,ACT,17,NRSV,for we too are his offspring
5365,ACT,17,NRSV,since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals
5366,ACT,17,NRSV,while god has overlooked the times of human ignorance now he commands all people everywhere to repent
5367,ACT,17,NRSV,because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead
5368,ACT,17,NRSV,when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some scoffed but others said we will hear you again about this
5369,ACT,17,NRSV,at that point paul left them
5370,ACT,17,NRSV,but some of them joined him and became believers including dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
5371,ACT,18,NRSV,after this paul
5372,ACT,18,NRSV,left athens and went to corinth
5373,ACT,18,NRSV,there he found a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had ordered all jews to leave rome paul
5374,ACT,18,NRSV,went to see them
5375,ACT,18,NRSV,and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and they worked togetherby trade they were tentmakers
5376,ACT,18,NRSV,every sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and would try to convince jews and greeks
5377,ACT,18,NRSV,when silas and timothy arrived from macedonia paul was occupied with proclaiming the word
5378,ACT,18,NRSV,testifying to the jews that the messiah
5379,ACT,18,NRSV,was jesus
5380,ACT,18,NRSV,when they opposed and reviled him in protest he shook the dust from his clothes
5381,ACT,18,NRSV,and said to them your blood be on your own heads i am innocent from now on i will go to the gentiles
5382,ACT,18,NRSV,then he left the synagogue
5383,ACT,18,NRSV,and went to the house of a man named titius
5384,ACT,18,NRSV,justus a worshiper of god his house was next door to the synagogue
5385,ACT,18,NRSV,crispus the official of the synagogue became a believer in the lord together with all his household and many of the corinthians who heard paul became believers and were baptized
5386,ACT,18,NRSV,one night the lord said to paul in a vision do not be afraid but speak and do not be silent
5387,ACT,18,NRSV,for i am with you and no one will lay a hand on you to harm you for there are many in this city who are my people
5388,ACT,18,NRSV,he stayed there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
5389,ACT,18,NRSV,but when gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews made a united attack on paul and brought him before the tribunal
5390,ACT,18,NRSV,they said this man is persuading people to worship god in ways that are contrary to the law
5391,ACT,18,NRSV,just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if it were a matter of crime or serious villainy i would be justified in accepting the complaint of you jews
5392,ACT,18,NRSV,but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters
5393,ACT,18,NRSV,and he dismissed them from the tribunal
5394,ACT,18,NRSV,then all of them
5395,ACT,18,NRSV,seized sosthenes the official of the synagogue and beat him in front of the tribunal but gallio paid no attention to any of these things
5396,ACT,18,NRSV,after staying there for a considerable time paul said farewell to the believers
5397,ACT,18,NRSV,and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila at cenchreae he had his hair cut for he was under a vow
5398,ACT,18,NRSV,when they reached ephesus he left them there but first he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews
5399,ACT,18,NRSV,when they asked him to stay longer he declined
5400,ACT,18,NRSV,but on taking leave of them he said i
5401,ACT,18,NRSV,will return to you if god wills then he set sail from ephesus
5402,ACT,18,NRSV,when he had landed at caesarea he went up to jerusalem
5403,ACT,18,NRSV,and greeted the church and then went down to antioch
5404,ACT,18,NRSV,after spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of galatia
5405,ACT,18,NRSV,and phrygia strengthening all the disciples
5406,ACT,18,NRSV,now there came to ephesus a jew named apollos a native of alexandria he was an eloquent man wellversed in the scriptures
5407,ACT,18,NRSV,he had been instructed in the way of the lord and he spoke with burning enthusiasm and taught accurately the things concerning jesus though he knew only the baptism of john
5408,ACT,18,NRSV,he began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained the way of god to him more accurately
5409,ACT,18,NRSV,and when he wished to cross over to achaia the believers
5410,ACT,18,NRSV,encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him on his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had become believers
5411,ACT,18,NRSV,for he powerfully refuted the jews in public showing by the scriptures that the messiah
5412,ACT,18,NRSV,is jesus
5413,ACT,19,NRSV,while apollos was in corinth paul passed through the interior regions and came to ephesus where he found some disciples
5414,ACT,19,NRSV,he said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you became believers they replied no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit
5415,ACT,19,NRSV,then he said into what then were you baptized they answered into johns baptism
5416,ACT,19,NRSV,paul said john baptized with the baptism of repentance telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is in jesus
5417,ACT,19,NRSV,on hearing this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
5418,ACT,19,NRSV,when paul had laid his hands on them the holy spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied
5419,ACT,19,NRSV,altogether there were about twelve of them
5420,ACT,19,NRSV,he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly and argued persuasively about the kingdom of god
5421,ACT,19,NRSV,when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus
5422,ACT,19,NRSV,this continued for two years so that all the residents of asia both jews and greeks heard the word of the lord
5423,ACT,19,NRSV,god did extraordinary miracles through paul
5424,ACT,19,NRSV,so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them
5425,ACT,19,NRSV,then some itinerant jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the lord jesus over those who had evil spirits saying i adjure you by the jesus whom paul proclaims
5426,ACT,19,NRSV,seven sons of a jewish high priest named sceva were doing this
5427,ACT,19,NRSV,but the evil spirit said to them in reply jesus i know and paul i know but who are you
5428,ACT,19,NRSV,then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them mastered them all and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded
5429,ACT,19,NRSV,when this became known to all residents of ephesus both jews and greeks everyone was awestruck and the name of the lord jesus was praised
5430,ACT,19,NRSV,also many of those who became believers confessed and disclosed their practices
5431,ACT,19,NRSV,a number of those who practiced magic collected their books and burned them publicly when the value of these books
5432,ACT,19,NRSV,was calculated it was found to come to fifty thousand silver coins
5433,ACT,19,NRSV,so the word of the lord grew mightily and prevailed
5434,ACT,19,NRSV,now after these things had been accomplished paul resolved in the spirit to go through macedonia and achaia and then to go on to jerusalem he said after i have gone there i must also see rome
5435,ACT,19,NRSV,so he sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus to macedonia while he himself stayed for some time longer in asia
5436,ACT,19,NRSV,about that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the way
5437,ACT,19,NRSV,a man named demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of artemis brought no little business to the artisans
5438,ACT,19,NRSV,these he gathered together with the workers of the same trade and said men you know that we get our wealth from this business
5439,ACT,19,NRSV,you also see and hear that not only in ephesus but in almost the whole of asia this paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods
5440,ACT,19,NRSV,and there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be scorned and she will be deprived of her majesty that brought all asia and the world to worship her
5441,ACT,19,NRSV,when they heard this they were enraged and shouted great is artemis of the ephesians
5442,ACT,19,NRSV,the city was filled with the confusion and people
5443,ACT,19,NRSV,rushed together to the theater dragging with them gaius and aristarchus macedonians who were pauls travel companions
5444,ACT,19,NRSV,paul wished to go into the crowd but the disciples would not let him
5445,ACT,19,NRSV,even some officials of the province of asia
5446,ACT,19,NRSV,who were friendly to him sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater
5447,ACT,19,NRSV,meanwhile some were shouting one thing some another for the assembly was in confusion and most of them did not know why they had come together
5448,ACT,19,NRSV,some of the crowd gave instructions to alexander whom the jews had pushed forward and alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people
5449,ACT,19,NRSV,but when they recognized that he was a jew for about two hours all of them shouted in unison great is artemis of the ephesians
5450,ACT,19,NRSV,but when the town clerk had quieted the crowd he said citizens of ephesus who is there that does not know that the city of the ephesians is the temple keeper of the great artemis and of the statue that fell from heaven
5451,ACT,19,NRSV,since these things cannot be denied you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash
5452,ACT,19,NRSV,you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our
5453,ACT,19,NRSV,goddess
5454,ACT,19,NRSV,if therefore demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them bring charges there against one another
5455,ACT,19,NRSV,if there is anything further
5456,ACT,19,NRSV,you want to know it must be settled in the regular assembly
5457,ACT,19,NRSV,for we are in danger of being charged with rioting today since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion
5458,ACT,19,NRSV,when he had said this he dismissed the assembly
5459,ACT,20,NRSV,after the uproar had ceased paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them and saying farewell he left for macedonia
5460,ACT,20,NRSV,when he had gone through those regions and had given the believers
5461,ACT,20,NRSV,much encouragement he came to greece
5462,ACT,20,NRSV,where he stayed for three months he was about to set sail for syria when a plot was made against him by the jews and so he decided to return through macedonia
5463,ACT,20,NRSV,he was accompanied by sopater son of pyrrhus from beroea by aristarchus and secundus from thessalonica by gaius from derbe and by timothy as well as by tychicus and trophimus from asia
5464,ACT,20,NRSV,they went ahead and were waiting for us in troas
5465,ACT,20,NRSV,but we sailed from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we joined them in troas where we stayed for seven days
5466,ACT,20,NRSV,on the first day of the week when we met to break bread paul was holding a discussion with them since he intended to leave the next day he continued speaking until midnight
5467,ACT,20,NRSV,there were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting
5468,ACT,20,NRSV,a young man named eutychus who was sitting in the window began to sink off into a deep sleep while paul talked still longer overcome by sleep he fell to the ground three floors below and was picked up dead
5469,ACT,20,NRSV,but paul went down and bending over him took him in his arms and said do not be alarmed for his life is in him
5470,ACT,20,NRSV,then paul went upstairs and after he had broken bread and eaten he continued to converse with them until dawn then he left
5471,ACT,20,NRSV,meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted
5472,ACT,20,NRSV,we went ahead to the ship and set sail for assos intending to take paul on board there for he had made this arrangement intending to go by land himself
5473,ACT,20,NRSV,when he met us in assos we took him on board and went to mitylene
5474,ACT,20,NRSV,we sailed from there and on the following day we arrived opposite chios the next day we touched at samos and
5475,ACT,20,NRSV,the day after that we came to miletus
5476,ACT,20,NRSV,for paul had decided to sail past ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in asia he was eager to be in jerusalem if possible on the day of pentecost
5477,ACT,20,NRSV,from miletus he sent a message to ephesus asking the elders of the church to meet him
5478,ACT,20,NRSV,when they came to him he said to them
5479,ACT,20,NRSV,you yourselves know how i lived among you the entire time from the first day that i set foot in asia
5480,ACT,20,NRSV,serving the lord with all humility and with tears enduring the trials that came to me through the plots of the jews
5481,ACT,20,NRSV,i did not shrink from doing anything helpful proclaiming the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house
5482,ACT,20,NRSV,as i testified to both jews and greeks about repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus
5483,ACT,20,NRSV,and now as a captive to the spirit
5484,ACT,20,NRSV,i am on my way to jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there
5485,ACT,20,NRSV,except that the holy spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me
5486,ACT,20,NRSV,but i do not count my life of any value to myself if only i may finish my course and the ministry that i received from the lord jesus to testify to the good news of gods grace
5487,ACT,20,NRSV,and now i know that none of you among whom i have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will ever see my face again
5488,ACT,20,NRSV,therefore i declare to you this day that i am not responsible for the blood of any of you
5489,ACT,20,NRSV,for i did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of god
5490,ACT,20,NRSV,keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock of which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god
5491,ACT,20,NRSV,that he obtained with the blood of his own son
5492,ACT,20,NRSV,i know that after i have gone savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock
5493,ACT,20,NRSV,some even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them
5494,ACT,20,NRSV,therefore be alert remembering that for three years i did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears
5495,ACT,20,NRSV,and now i commend you to god and to the message of his grace a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified
5496,ACT,20,NRSV,i coveted no ones silver or gold or clothing
5497,ACT,20,NRSV,you know for yourselves that i worked with my own hands to support myself and my companions
5498,ACT,20,NRSV,in all this i have given you an example that by such work we must support the weak remembering the words of the lord jesus for he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive
5499,ACT,20,NRSV,when he had finished speaking he knelt down with them all and prayed
5500,ACT,20,NRSV,there was much weeping among them all they embraced paul and kissed him
5501,ACT,20,NRSV,grieving especially because of what he had said that they would not see him again then they brought him to the ship
5502,ACT,21,NRSV,when we had parted from them and set sail we came by a straight course to cos and the next day to rhodes and from there to patara
5503,ACT,21,NRSV,when we found a ship bound for phoenicia we went on board and set sail
5504,ACT,21,NRSV,we came in sight of cyprus and leaving it on our left we sailed to syria and landed at tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there
5505,ACT,21,NRSV,we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days through the spirit they told paul not to go on to jerusalem
5506,ACT,21,NRSV,when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey and all of them with wives and children escorted us outside the city there we knelt down on the beach and prayed
5507,ACT,21,NRSV,and said farewell to one another then we went on board the ship and they returned home
5508,ACT,21,NRSV,when we had finished
5509,ACT,21,NRSV,the voyage from tyre we arrived at ptolemais and we greeted the believers
5510,ACT,21,NRSV,and stayed with them for one day
5511,ACT,21,NRSV,the next day we left and came to caesarea and we went into the house of philip the evangelist one of the seven and stayed with him
5512,ACT,21,NRSV,he had four unmarried daughters
5513,ACT,21,NRSV,who had the gift of prophecy
5514,ACT,21,NRSV,while we were staying there for several days a prophet named agabus came down from judea
5515,ACT,21,NRSV,he came to us and took pauls belt bound his own feet and hands with it and said thus says the holy spirit this is the way the jews in jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles
5516,ACT,21,NRSV,when we heard this we and the people there urged him not to go up to jerusalem
5517,ACT,21,NRSV,then paul answered what are you doing weeping and breaking my heart for i am ready not only to be bound but even to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
5518,ACT,21,NRSV,since he would not be persuaded we remained silent except to say the lords will be done
5519,ACT,21,NRSV,after these days we got ready and started to go up to jerusalem
5520,ACT,21,NRSV,some of the disciples from caesarea also came along and brought us to the house of mnason of cyprus an early disciple with whom we were to stay
5521,ACT,21,NRSV,when we arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us warmly
5522,ACT,21,NRSV,the next day paul went with us to visit james and all the elders were present
5523,ACT,21,NRSV,after greeting them he related one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry
5524,ACT,21,NRSV,when they heard it they praised god then they said to him you see brother how many thousands of believers there are among the jews and they are all zealous for the law
5525,ACT,21,NRSV,they have been told about you that you teach all the jews living among the gentiles to forsake moses and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs
5526,ACT,21,NRSV,what then is to be done they will certainly hear that you have come
5527,ACT,21,NRSV,so do what we tell you we have four men who are under a vow
5528,ACT,21,NRSV,join these men go through the rite of purification with them and pay for the shaving of their heads thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself observe and guard the law
5529,ACT,21,NRSV,but as for the gentiles who have become believers we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled
5530,ACT,21,NRSV,and from fornication
5531,ACT,21,NRSV,then paul took the men and the next day having purified himself he entered the temple with them making public the completion of the days of purification when the sacrifice would be made for each of them
5532,ACT,21,NRSV,when the seven days were almost completed the jews from asia who had seen him in the temple stirred up the whole crowd they seized him
5533,ACT,21,NRSV,shouting fellow israelites help this is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against our people our law and this place more than that he has actually brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place
5534,ACT,21,NRSV,for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with him in the city and they supposed that paul had brought him into the temple
5535,ACT,21,NRSV,then all the city was aroused and the people rushed together they seized paul and dragged him out of the temple and immediately the doors were shut
5536,ACT,21,NRSV,while they were trying to kill him word came to the tribune of the cohort that all jerusalem was in an uproar
5537,ACT,21,NRSV,immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they stopped beating paul
5538,ACT,21,NRSV,then the tribune came arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains he inquired who he was and what he had done
5539,ACT,21,NRSV,some in the crowd shouted one thing some another and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar he ordered him to be brought into the barracks
5540,ACT,21,NRSV,when paul
5541,ACT,21,NRSV,came to the steps the violence of the mob was so great that he had to be carried by the soldiers
5542,ACT,21,NRSV,the crowd that followed kept shouting away with him
5543,ACT,21,NRSV,just as paul was about to be brought into the barracks he said to the tribune may i say something to you the tribune
5544,ACT,21,NRSV,replied do you know greek
5545,ACT,21,NRSV,then you are not the egyptian who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness
5546,ACT,21,NRSV,paul replied i am a jew from tarsus in cilicia a citizen of an important city i beg you let me speak to the people
5547,ACT,21,NRSV,when he had given him permission paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence and when there was a great hush he addressed them in the hebrew
5548,ACT,21,NRSV,language saying
5549,ACT,22,NRSV,brothers and fathers listen to the defense that i now make before you
5550,ACT,22,NRSV,when they heard him addressing them in hebrew
5551,ACT,22,NRSV,they became even more quiet then he said
5552,ACT,22,NRSV,i am a jew born in tarsus in cilicia but brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel educated strictly according to our ancestral law being zealous for god just as all of you are today
5553,ACT,22,NRSV,i persecuted this way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison
5554,ACT,22,NRSV,as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me from them i also received letters to the brothers in damascus and i went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to jerusalem for punishment
5555,ACT,22,NRSV,while i was on my way and approaching damascus about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me
5556,ACT,22,NRSV,i fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me saul saul why are you persecuting me
5557,ACT,22,NRSV,i answered who are you lord then he said to me i am jesus of nazareth
5558,ACT,22,NRSV,whom you are persecuting
5559,ACT,22,NRSV,now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me
5560,ACT,22,NRSV,i asked what am i to do lord the lord said to me get up and go to damascus there you will be told everything that has been assigned to you to do
5561,ACT,22,NRSV,since i could not see because of the brightness of that light those who were with me took my hand and led me to damascus
5562,ACT,22,NRSV,a certain ananias who was a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the jews living there
5563,ACT,22,NRSV,came to me and standing beside me he said brother saul regain your sight in that very hour i regained my sight and saw him
5564,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said the god of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will to see the righteous one and to hear his own voice
5565,ACT,22,NRSV,for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard
5566,ACT,22,NRSV,and now why do you delay get up be baptized and have your sins washed away calling on his name
5567,ACT,22,NRSV,after i had returned to jerusalem and while i was praying in the temple i fell into a trance
5568,ACT,22,NRSV,and saw jesus
5569,ACT,22,NRSV,saying to me hurry and get out of jerusalem quickly because they will not accept your testimony about me
5570,ACT,22,NRSV,and i said lord they themselves know that in every synagogue i imprisoned and beat those who believed in you
5571,ACT,22,NRSV,and while the blood of your witness stephen was shed i myself was standing by approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him
5572,ACT,22,NRSV,then he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles
5573,ACT,22,NRSV,up to this point they listened to him but then they shouted away with such a fellow from the earth for he should not be allowed to live
5574,ACT,22,NRSV,and while they were shouting throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air
5575,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks and ordered him to be examined by flogging to find out the reason for this outcry against him
5576,ACT,22,NRSV,but when they had tied him up with thongs
5577,ACT,22,NRSV,paul said to the centurion who was standing by is it legal for you to flog a roman citizen who is uncondemned
5578,ACT,22,NRSV,when the centurion heard that he went to the tribune and said to him what are you about to do this man is a roman citizen
5579,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune came and asked paul
5580,ACT,22,NRSV,tell me are you a roman citizen and he said yes
5581,ACT,22,NRSV,the tribune answered it cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship paul said but i was born a citizen
5582,ACT,22,NRSV,immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him and the tribune also was afraid for he realized that paul was a roman citizen and that he had bound him
5583,ACT,22,NRSV,since he wanted to find out what paul
5584,ACT,22,NRSV,was being accused of by the jews the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet he brought paul down and had him stand before them
5585,ACT,23,NRSV,while paul was looking intently at the council he said brothers
5586,ACT,23,NRSV,up to this day i have lived my life with a clear conscience before god
5587,ACT,23,NRSV,then the high priest ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth
5588,ACT,23,NRSV,at this paul said to him god will strike you you whitewashed wall are you sitting there to judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck
5589,ACT,23,NRSV,those standing nearby said do you dare to insult gods high priest
5590,ACT,23,NRSV,and paul said i did not realize brothers that he was high priest for it is written you shall not speak evil of a leader of your people
5591,ACT,23,NRSV,when paul noticed that some were sadducees and others were pharisees he called out in the council brothers i am a pharisee a son of pharisees i am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection
5592,ACT,23,NRSV,of the dead
5593,ACT,23,NRSV,when he said this a dissension began between the pharisees and the sadducees and the assembly was divided
5594,ACT,23,NRSV,the sadducees say that there is no resurrection or angel or spirit but the pharisees acknowledge all three
5595,ACT,23,NRSV,then a great clamor arose and certain scribes of the pharisees group stood up and contended we find nothing wrong with this man what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him
5596,ACT,23,NRSV,when the dissension became violent the tribune fearing that they would tear paul to pieces ordered the soldiers to go down take him by force and bring him into the barracks
5597,ACT,23,NRSV,that night the lord stood near him and said keep up your courage for just as you have testified for me in jerusalem so you must bear witness also in rome
5598,ACT,23,NRSV,in the morning the jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed paul
5599,ACT,23,NRSV,there were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy
5600,ACT,23,NRSV,they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed paul
5601,ACT,23,NRSV,now then you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case and we are ready to do away with him before he arrives
5602,ACT,23,NRSV,now the son of pauls sister heard about the ambush so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told paul
5603,ACT,23,NRSV,paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the tribune for he has something to report to him
5604,ACT,23,NRSV,so he took him brought him to the tribune and said the prisoner paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you he has something to tell you
5605,ACT,23,NRSV,the tribune took him by the hand drew him aside privately and asked what is it that you have to report to me
5606,ACT,23,NRSV,he answered the jews have agreed to ask you to bring paul down to the council tomorrow as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into his case
5607,ACT,23,NRSV,but do not be persuaded by them for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him they have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him they are ready now and are waiting for your consent
5608,ACT,23,NRSV,so the tribune dismissed the young man ordering him tell no one that you have informed me of this
5609,ACT,23,NRSV,then he summoned two of the centurions and said get ready to leave by nine oclock tonight for caesarea with two hundred soldiers seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen
5610,ACT,23,NRSV,also provide mounts for paul to ride and take him safely to felix the governor
5611,ACT,23,NRSV,he wrote a letter to this effect
5612,ACT,23,NRSV,claudius lysias to his excellency the governor felix greetings
5613,ACT,23,NRSV,this man was seized by the jews and was about to be killed by them but when i had learned that he was a roman citizen i came with the guard and rescued him
5614,ACT,23,NRSV,since i wanted to know the charge for which they accused him i had him brought to their council
5615,ACT,23,NRSV,i found that he was accused concerning questions of their law but was charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment
5616,ACT,23,NRSV,when i was informed that there would be a plot against the man i sent him to you at once ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him
5617,ACT,23,NRSV,
5618,ACT,23,NRSV,so the soldiers according to their instructions took paul and brought him during the night to antipatris
5619,ACT,23,NRSV,the next day they let the horsemen go on with him while they returned to the barracks
5620,ACT,23,NRSV,when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they presented paul also before him
5621,ACT,23,NRSV,on reading the letter he asked what province he belonged to and when he learned that he was from cilicia
5622,ACT,23,NRSV,he said i will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive then he ordered that he be kept under guard in herods headquarters
5623,ACT,24,NRSV,five days later the high priest ananias came down with some elders and an attorney a certain tertullus and they reported their case against paul to the governor
5624,ACT,24,NRSV,when paul
5625,ACT,24,NRSV,had been summoned tertullus began to accuse him saying
5626,ACT,24,NRSV,your excellency
5627,ACT,24,NRSV,because of you we have long enjoyed peace and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight
5628,ACT,24,NRSV,we welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude
5629,ACT,24,NRSV,but to detain you no further i beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness
5630,ACT,24,NRSV,we have in fact found this man a pestilent fellow an agitator among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
5631,ACT,24,NRSV,he even tried to profane the temple and so we seized him
5632,ACT,24,NRSV,by examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him
5633,ACT,24,NRSV,the jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true
5634,ACT,24,NRSV,when the governor motioned to him to speak paul replied
5635,ACT,24,NRSV,i cheerfully make my defense knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation
5636,ACT,24,NRSV,as you can find out it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship in jerusalem
5637,ACT,24,NRSV,they did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city
5638,ACT,24,NRSV,neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me
5639,ACT,24,NRSV,but this i admit to you that according to the way which they call a sect i worship the god of our ancestors believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets
5640,ACT,24,NRSV,i have a hope in goda hope that they themselves also acceptthat there will be a resurrection of both
5641,ACT,24,NRSV,the righteous and the unrighteous
5642,ACT,24,NRSV,therefore i do my best always to have a clear conscience toward god and all people
5643,ACT,24,NRSV,now after some years i came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices
5644,ACT,24,NRSV,while i was doing this they found me in the temple completing the rite of purification without any crowd or disturbance
5645,ACT,24,NRSV,but there were some jews from asiathey ought to be here before you to make an accusation if they have anything against me
5646,ACT,24,NRSV,or let these men here tell what crime they had found when i stood before the council
5647,ACT,24,NRSV,unless it was this one sentence that i called out while standing before them it is about the resurrection of the dead that i am on trial before you today
5648,ACT,24,NRSV,but felix who was rather well informed about the way adjourned the hearing with the comment when lysias the tribune comes down i will decide your case
5649,ACT,24,NRSV,then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs
5650,ACT,24,NRSV,some days later when felix came with his wife drusilla who was jewish he sent for paul and heard him speak concerning faith in christ jesus
5651,ACT,24,NRSV,and as he discussed justice selfcontrol and the coming judgment felix became frightened and said go away for the present when i have an opportunity i will send for you
5652,ACT,24,NRSV,at the same time he hoped that money would be given him by paul and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him
5653,ACT,24,NRSV,after two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and since he wanted to grant the jews a favor felix left paul in prison
5654,ACT,25,NRSV,three days after festus had arrived in the province he went up from caesarea to jerusalem
5655,ACT,25,NRSV,where the chief priests and the leaders of the jews gave him a report against paul they appealed to him
5656,ACT,25,NRSV,and requested as a favor to them against paul
5657,ACT,25,NRSV,to have him transferred to jerusalem they were in fact planning an ambush to kill him along the way
5658,ACT,25,NRSV,festus replied that paul was being kept at caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly
5659,ACT,25,NRSV,so he said let those of you who have the authority come down with me and if there is anything wrong about the man let them accuse him
5660,ACT,25,NRSV,after he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days he went down to caesarea the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered paul to be brought
5661,ACT,25,NRSV,when he arrived the jews who had gone down from jerusalem surrounded him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove
5662,ACT,25,NRSV,paul said in his defense i have in no way committed an offense against the law of the jews or against the temple or against the emperor
5663,ACT,25,NRSV,but festus wishing to do the jews a favor asked paul do you wish to go up to jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges
5664,ACT,25,NRSV,paul said i am appealing to the emperors tribunal this is where i should be tried i have done no wrong to the jews as you very well know
5665,ACT,25,NRSV,now if i am in the wrong and have committed something for which i deserve to die i am not trying to escape death but if there is nothing to their charges against me no one can turn me over to them i appeal to the emperor
5666,ACT,25,NRSV,then festus after he had conferred with his council replied you have appealed to the emperor to the emperor you will go
5667,ACT,25,NRSV,after several days had passed king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea to welcome festus
5668,ACT,25,NRSV,since they were staying there several days festus laid pauls case before the king saying there is a man here who was left in prison by felix
5669,ACT,25,NRSV,when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him
5670,ACT,25,NRSV,i told them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge
5671,ACT,25,NRSV,so when they met here i lost no time but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought
5672,ACT,25,NRSV,when the accusers stood up they did not charge him with any of the crimes
5673,ACT,25,NRSV,that i was expecting
5674,ACT,25,NRSV,instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain jesus who had died but whom paul asserted to be alive
5675,ACT,25,NRSV,since i was at a loss how to investigate these questions i asked whether he wished to go to jerusalem and be tried there on these charges
5676,ACT,25,NRSV,but when paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his imperial majesty i ordered him to be held until i could send him to the emperor
5677,ACT,25,NRSV,agrippa said to festus i would like to hear the man myself tomorrow he said you will hear him
5678,ACT,25,NRSV,so on the next day agrippa and bernice came with great pomp and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city then festus gave the order and paul was brought in
5679,ACT,25,NRSV,and festus said king agrippa and all here present with us you see this man about whom the whole jewish community petitioned me both in jerusalem and here shouting that he ought not to live any longer
5680,ACT,25,NRSV,but i found that he had done nothing deserving death and when he appealed to his imperial majesty i decided to send him
5681,ACT,25,NRSV,but i have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that after we have examined him i may have something to write
5682,ACT,25,NRSV,for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him
5683,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul you have permission to speak for yourself then paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself
5684,ACT,26,NRSV,i consider myself fortunate that it is before you king agrippa i am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the jews
5685,ACT,26,NRSV,because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the jews therefore i beg of you to listen to me patiently
5686,ACT,26,NRSV,all the jews know my way of life from my youth a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in jerusalem
5687,ACT,26,NRSV,they have known for a long time if they are willing to testify that i have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a pharisee
5688,ACT,26,NRSV,and now i stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by god to our ancestors
5689,ACT,26,NRSV,a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly worship day and night it is for this hope your excellency
5690,ACT,26,NRSV,that i am accused by jews
5691,ACT,26,NRSV,why is it thought incredible by any of you that god raises the dead
5692,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed i myself was convinced that i ought to do many things against the name of jesus of nazareth
5693,ACT,26,NRSV,and that is what i did in jerusalem with authority received from the chief priests i not only locked up many of the saints in prison but i also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death
5694,ACT,26,NRSV,by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to blaspheme and since i was so furiously enraged at them i pursued them even to foreign cities
5695,ACT,26,NRSV,with this in mind i was traveling to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests
5696,ACT,26,NRSV,when at midday along the road your excellency
5697,ACT,26,NRSV,i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions
5698,ACT,26,NRSV,when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew
5699,ACT,26,NRSV,language saul saul why are you persecuting me it hurts you to kick against the goads
5700,ACT,26,NRSV,i asked who are you lord the lord answered i am jesus whom you are persecuting
5701,ACT,26,NRSV,but get up and stand on your feet for i have appeared to you for this purpose to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me
5702,ACT,26,NRSV,and to those in which i will appear to you
5703,ACT,26,NRSV,i will rescue you from your people and from the gentilesto whom i am sending you
5704,ACT,26,NRSV,to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
5705,ACT,26,NRSV,after that king agrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision
5706,ACT,26,NRSV,but declared first to those in damascus then in jerusalem and throughout the countryside of judea and also to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do deeds consistent with repentance
5707,ACT,26,NRSV,for this reason the jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me
5708,ACT,26,NRSV,to this day i have had help from god and so i stand here testifying to both small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would take place
5709,ACT,26,NRSV,that the messiah
5710,ACT,26,NRSV,must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the gentiles
5711,ACT,26,NRSV,while he was making this defense festus exclaimed you are out of your mind paul too much learning is driving you insane
5712,ACT,26,NRSV,but paul said i am not out of my mind most excellent festus but i am speaking the sober truth
5713,ACT,26,NRSV,indeed the king knows about these things and to him i speak freely for i am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice for this was not done in a corner
5714,ACT,26,NRSV,king agrippa do you believe the prophets i know that you believe
5715,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to paul are you so quickly persuading me to become a christian
5716,ACT,26,NRSV,paul replied whether quickly or not i pray to god that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as i amexcept for these chains
5717,ACT,26,NRSV,then the king got up and with him the governor and bernice and those who had been seated with them
5718,ACT,26,NRSV,and as they were leaving they said to one another this man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment
5719,ACT,26,NRSV,agrippa said to festus this man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor
5720,ACT,27,NRSV,when it was decided that we were to sail for italy they transferred paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the augustan cohort named julius
5721,ACT,27,NRSV,embarking on a ship of adramyttium that was about to set sail to the ports along the coast of asia we put to sea accompanied by aristarchus a macedonian from thessalonica
5722,ACT,27,NRSV,the next day we put in at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for
5723,ACT,27,NRSV,putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of cyprus because the winds were against us
5724,ACT,27,NRSV,after we had sailed across the sea that is off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia
5725,ACT,27,NRSV,there the centurion found an alexandrian ship bound for italy and put us on board
5726,ACT,27,NRSV,we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind was against us we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone
5727,ACT,27,NRSV,sailing past it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near the city of lasea
5728,ACT,27,NRSV,since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous because even the fast had already gone by paul advised them
5729,ACT,27,NRSV,saying sirs i can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives
5730,ACT,27,NRSV,but the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what paul said
5731,ACT,27,NRSV,since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach phoenix where they could spend the winter it was a harbor of crete facing southwest and northwest
5732,ACT,27,NRSV,when a moderate south wind began to blow they thought they could achieve their purpose so they weighed anchor and began to sail past crete close to the shore
5733,ACT,27,NRSV,but soon a violent wind called the northeaster rushed down from crete
5734,ACT,27,NRSV,since the ship was caught and could not be turned headon into the wind we gave way to it and were driven
5735,ACT,27,NRSV,by running under the lee of a small island called cauda
5736,ACT,27,NRSV,we were scarcely able to get the ships boat under control
5737,ACT,27,NRSV,after hoisting it up they took measures
5738,ACT,27,NRSV,to undergird the ship then fearing that they would run on the syrtis they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven
5739,ACT,27,NRSV,we were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard
5740,ACT,27,NRSV,and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackle overboard
5741,ACT,27,NRSV,when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small tempest raged all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned
5742,ACT,27,NRSV,since they had been without food for a long time paul then stood up among them and said men you should have listened to me and not have set sail from crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss
5743,ACT,27,NRSV,i urge you now to keep up your courage for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship
5744,ACT,27,NRSV,for last night there stood by me an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i worship
5745,ACT,27,NRSV,and he said do not be afraid paul you must stand before the emperor and indeed god has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you
5746,ACT,27,NRSV,so keep up your courage men for i have faith in god that it will be exactly as i have been told
5747,ACT,27,NRSV,but we will have to run aground on some island
5748,ACT,27,NRSV,when the fourteenth night had come as we were drifting across the sea of adria about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land
5749,ACT,27,NRSV,so they took soundings and found twenty fathoms a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms
5750,ACT,27,NRSV,fearing that we might run on the rocks they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come
5751,ACT,27,NRSV,but when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow
5752,ACT,27,NRSV,paul said to the centurion and the soldiers unless these men stay in the ship you cannot be saved
5753,ACT,27,NRSV,then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift
5754,ACT,27,NRSV,just before daybreak paul urged all of them to take some food saying today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and remaining without food having eaten nothing
5755,ACT,27,NRSV,therefore i urge you to take some food for it will help you survive for none of you will lose a hair from your heads
5756,ACT,27,NRSV,after he had said this he took bread and giving thanks to god in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat
5757,ACT,27,NRSV,then all of them were encouraged and took food for themselves
5758,ACT,27,NRSV,we were in all two hundred seventysix
5759,ACT,27,NRSV,persons in the ship
5760,ACT,27,NRSV,after they had satisfied their hunger they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea
5761,ACT,27,NRSV,in the morning they did not recognize the land but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if they could
5762,ACT,27,NRSV,so they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea at the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steeringoars then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach
5763,ACT,27,NRSV,but striking a reef
5764,ACT,27,NRSV,they ran the ship aground the bow stuck and remained immovable but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves
5765,ACT,27,NRSV,the soldiers plan was to kill the prisoners so that none might swim away and escape
5766,ACT,27,NRSV,but the centurion wishing to save paul kept them from carrying out their plan he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land
5767,ACT,27,NRSV,and the rest to follow some on planks and others on pieces of the ship and so it was that all were brought safely to land
5768,ACT,28,NRSV,after we had reached safety we then learned that the island was called malta
5769,ACT,28,NRSV,the natives showed us unusual kindness since it had begun to rain and was cold they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us around it
5770,ACT,28,NRSV,paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand
5771,ACT,28,NRSV,when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand they said to one another this man must be a murderer though he has escaped from the sea justice has not allowed him to live
5772,ACT,28,NRSV,he however shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm
5773,ACT,28,NRSV,they were expecting him to swell up or drop dead but after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing unusual had happened to him they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god
5774,ACT,28,NRSV,now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island named publius who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days
5775,ACT,28,NRSV,it so happened that the father of publius lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery paul visited him and cured him by praying and putting his hands on him
5776,ACT,28,NRSV,after this happened the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured
5777,ACT,28,NRSV,they bestowed many honors on us and when we were about to sail they put on board all the provisions we needed
5778,ACT,28,NRSV,three months later we set sail on a ship that had wintered at the island an alexandrian ship with the twin brothers as its figurehead
5779,ACT,28,NRSV,we put in at syracuse and stayed there for three days
5780,ACT,28,NRSV,then we weighed anchor and came to rhegium after one day there a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to puteoli
5781,ACT,28,NRSV,there we found believers
5782,ACT,28,NRSV,and were invited to stay with them for seven days and so we came to rome
5783,ACT,28,NRSV,the believers
5784,ACT,28,NRSV,from there when they heard of us came as far as the forum of appius and three taverns to meet us on seeing them paul thanked god and took courage
5785,ACT,28,NRSV,when we came into rome paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him
5786,ACT,28,NRSV,three days later he called together the local leaders of the jews when they had assembled he said to them brothers though i had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors yet i was arrested in jerusalem and handed over to the romans
5787,ACT,28,NRSV,when they had examined me the romans
5788,ACT,28,NRSV,wanted to release me because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case
5789,ACT,28,NRSV,but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to the emperoreven though i had no charge to bring against my nation
5790,ACT,28,NRSV,for this reason therefore i have asked to see you and speak with you
5791,ACT,28,NRSV,since it is for the sake of the hope of israel that i am bound with this chain
5792,ACT,28,NRSV,they replied we have received no letters from judea about you and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you
5793,ACT,28,NRSV,but we would like to hear from you what you think for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against
5794,ACT,28,NRSV,after they had set a day to meet with him they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers from morning until evening he explained the matter to them testifying to the kingdom of god and trying to convince them about jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets
5795,ACT,28,NRSV,some were convinced by what he had said while others refused to believe
5796,ACT,28,NRSV,so they disagreed with each other and as they were leaving paul made one further statement the holy spirit was right in saying to your ancestors through the prophet isaiah
5797,ACT,28,NRSV,go to this people and say
5798,ACT,28,NRSV,you will indeed listen but never understand
5799,ACT,28,NRSV,and you will indeed look but never perceive
5800,ACT,28,NRSV,for this peoples heart has grown dull
5801,ACT,28,NRSV,and their ears are hard of hearing
5802,ACT,28,NRSV,and they have shut their eyes
5803,ACT,28,NRSV,so that they might not look with their eyes
5804,ACT,28,NRSV,and listen with their ears
5805,ACT,28,NRSV,and understand with their heart and turn
5806,ACT,28,NRSV,and i would heal them
5807,ACT,28,NRSV,let it be known to you then that this salvation of god has been sent to the gentiles they will listen
5808,ACT,28,NRSV,he lived there two whole years at his own expense
5809,ACT,28,NRSV,and welcomed all who came to him
5810,ACT,28,NRSV,proclaiming the kingdom of god and teaching about the lord jesus christ with all boldness and without hindrance
5811,ROM,1,NRSV,paul a servant
5812,ROM,1,NRSV,of jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god
5813,ROM,1,NRSV,which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures
5814,ROM,1,NRSV,the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh
5815,ROM,1,NRSV,and was declared to be son of god with power according to the spirit
5816,ROM,1,NRSV,of holiness by resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord
5817,ROM,1,NRSV,through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the gentiles for the sake of his name
5818,ROM,1,NRSV,including yourselves who are called to belong to jesus christ
5819,ROM,1,NRSV,to all gods beloved in rome who are called to be saints
5820,ROM,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
5821,ROM,1,NRSV,first i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you because your faith is proclaimed throughout the world
5822,ROM,1,NRSV,for god whom i serve with my spirit by announcing the gospel
5823,ROM,1,NRSV,of his son is my witness that without ceasing i remember you always in my prayers
5824,ROM,1,NRSV,asking that by gods will i may somehow at last succeed in coming to you
5825,ROM,1,NRSV,for i am longing to see you so that i may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you
5826,ROM,1,NRSV,or rather so that we may be mutually encouraged by each others faith both yours and mine
5827,ROM,1,NRSV,i want you to know brothers and sisters
5828,ROM,1,NRSV,that i have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented in order that i may reap some harvest among you as i have among the rest of the gentiles
5829,ROM,1,NRSV,i am a debtor both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish
5830,ROM,1,NRSV,hence my eagerness to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in rome
5831,ROM,1,NRSV,for i am not ashamed of the gospel it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and also to the greek
5832,ROM,1,NRSV,for in it the righteousness of god is revealed through faith for faith as it is written the one who is righteous will live by faith
5833,ROM,1,NRSV,for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those who by their wickedness suppress the truth
5834,ROM,1,NRSV,for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them
5835,ROM,1,NRSV,ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature invisible though they are have been understood and seen through the things he has made so they are without excuse
5836,ROM,1,NRSV,for though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened
5837,ROM,1,NRSV,claiming to be wise they became fools
5838,ROM,1,NRSV,and they exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or fourfooted animals or reptiles
5839,ROM,1,NRSV,therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the degrading of their bodies among themselves
5840,ROM,1,NRSV,because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen
5841,ROM,1,NRSV,for this reason god gave them up to degrading passions their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural
5842,ROM,1,NRSV,and in the same way also the men giving up natural intercourse with women were consumed with passion for one another men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error
5843,ROM,1,NRSV,and since they did not see fit to acknowledge god god gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done
5844,ROM,1,NRSV,they were filled with every kind of wickedness evil covetousness malice full of envy murder strife deceit craftiness they are gossips
5845,ROM,1,NRSV,slanderers godhaters
5846,ROM,1,NRSV,insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil rebellious toward parents
5847,ROM,1,NRSV,foolish faithless heartless ruthless
5848,ROM,1,NRSV,they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to dieyet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them
5849,ROM,2,NRSV,therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things
5850,ROM,2,NRSV,you say
5851,ROM,2,NRSV,we know that gods judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth
5852,ROM,2,NRSV,do you imagine whoever you are that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself you will escape the judgment of god
5853,ROM,2,NRSV,or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience do you not realize that gods kindness is meant to lead you to repentance
5854,ROM,2,NRSV,but by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when gods righteous judgment will be revealed
5855,ROM,2,NRSV,for he will repay according to each ones deeds
5856,ROM,2,NRSV,to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life
5857,ROM,2,NRSV,while for those who are selfseeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness there will be wrath and fury
5858,ROM,2,NRSV,there will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil the jew first and also the greek
5859,ROM,2,NRSV,but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good the jew first and also the greek
5860,ROM,2,NRSV,for god shows no partiality
5861,ROM,2,NRSV,all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law
5862,ROM,2,NRSV,for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in gods sight but the doers of the law who will be justified
5863,ROM,2,NRSV,when gentiles who do not possess the law do instinctively what the law requires these though not having the law are a law to themselves
5864,ROM,2,NRSV,they show that what the law requires is written on their hearts to which their own conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them
5865,ROM,2,NRSV,on the day when according to my gospel god through jesus christ will judge the secret thoughts of all
5866,ROM,2,NRSV,but if you call yourself a jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to god
5867,ROM,2,NRSV,and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law
5868,ROM,2,NRSV,and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness
5869,ROM,2,NRSV,a corrector of the foolish a teacher of children having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth
5870,ROM,2,NRSV,you then that teach others will you not teach yourself while you preach against stealing do you steal
5871,ROM,2,NRSV,you that forbid adultery do you commit adultery you that abhor idols do you rob temples
5872,ROM,2,NRSV,you that boast in the law do you dishonor god by breaking the law
5873,ROM,2,NRSV,for as it is written the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you
5874,ROM,2,NRSV,circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law but if you break the law your circumcision has become uncircumcision
5875,ROM,2,NRSV,so if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision
5876,ROM,2,NRSV,then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law
5877,ROM,2,NRSV,for a person is not a jew who is one outwardly nor is true circumcision something external and physical
5878,ROM,2,NRSV,rather a person is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heartit is spiritual and not literal such a person receives praise not from others but from god
5879,ROM,3,NRSV,then what advantage has the jew or what is the value of circumcision
5880,ROM,3,NRSV,much in every way for in the first place the jews
5881,ROM,3,NRSV,were entrusted with the oracles of god
5882,ROM,3,NRSV,what if some were unfaithful will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of god
5883,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means although everyone is a liar let god be proved true as it is written
5884,ROM,3,NRSV,so that you may be justified in your words
5885,ROM,3,NRSV,and prevail in your judging
5886,ROM,3,NRSV,but if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of god what should we say that god is unjust to inflict wrath on us i speak in a human way
5887,ROM,3,NRSV,by no means for then how could god judge the world
5888,ROM,3,NRSV,but if through my falsehood gods truthfulness abounds to his glory why am i still being condemned as a sinner
5889,ROM,3,NRSV,and why not say as some people slander us by saying that we say let us do evil so that good may come their condemnation is deserved
5890,ROM,3,NRSV,what then are we any better off
5891,ROM,3,NRSV,no not at all for we have already charged that all both jews and greeks are under the power of sin
5892,ROM,3,NRSV,as it is written
5893,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no one who is righteous not even one
5894,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no one who has understanding
5895,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no one who seeks god
5896,ROM,3,NRSV,all have turned aside together they have become worthless
5897,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no one who shows kindness
5898,ROM,3,NRSV,there is not even one
5899,ROM,3,NRSV,their throats are opened graves
5900,ROM,3,NRSV,they use their tongues to deceive
5901,ROM,3,NRSV,the venom of vipers is under their lips
5902,ROM,3,NRSV,their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness
5903,ROM,3,NRSV,their feet are swift to shed blood
5904,ROM,3,NRSV,ruin and misery are in their paths
5905,ROM,3,NRSV,and the way of peace they have not known
5906,ROM,3,NRSV,there is no fear of god before their eyes
5907,ROM,3,NRSV,now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to god
5908,ROM,3,NRSV,for no human being will be justified in his sight by deeds prescribed by the law for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
5909,ROM,3,NRSV,but now apart from law the righteousness of god has been disclosed and is attested by the law and the prophets
5910,ROM,3,NRSV,the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ
5911,ROM,3,NRSV,for all who believe for there is no distinction
5912,ROM,3,NRSV,since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5913,ROM,3,NRSV,they are now justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus
5914,ROM,3,NRSV,whom god put forward as a sacrifice of atonement
5915,ROM,3,NRSV,by his blood effective through faith he did this to show his righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed
5916,ROM,3,NRSV,it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in jesus
5917,ROM,3,NRSV,then what becomes of boasting it is excluded by what law by that of works no but by the law of faith
5918,ROM,3,NRSV,for we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law
5919,ROM,3,NRSV,or is god the god of jews only is he not the god of gentiles also yes of gentiles also
5920,ROM,3,NRSV,since god is one and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith
5921,ROM,3,NRSV,do we then overthrow the law by this faith by no means on the contrary we uphold the law
5922,ROM,4,NRSV,what then are we to say was gained by
5923,ROM,4,NRSV,abraham our ancestor according to the flesh
5924,ROM,4,NRSV,for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before god
5925,ROM,4,NRSV,for what does the scripture say abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness
5926,ROM,4,NRSV,now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due
5927,ROM,4,NRSV,but to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly such faith is reckoned as righteousness
5928,ROM,4,NRSV,so also david speaks of the blessedness of those to whom god reckons righteousness apart from works
5929,ROM,4,NRSV,blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven
5930,ROM,4,NRSV,and whose sins are covered
5931,ROM,4,NRSV,blessed is the one against whom the lord will not reckon sin
5932,ROM,4,NRSV,is this blessedness then pronounced only on the circumcised or also on the uncircumcised we say faith was reckoned to abraham as righteousness
5933,ROM,4,NRSV,how then was it reckoned to him was it before or after he had been circumcised it was not after but before he was circumcised
5934,ROM,4,NRSV,he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised the purpose was to make him the ancestor of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them
5935,ROM,4,NRSV,and likewise the ancestor of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow the example of the faith that our ancestor abraham had before he was circumcised
5936,ROM,4,NRSV,for the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith
5937,ROM,4,NRSV,if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void
5938,ROM,4,NRSV,for the law brings wrath but where there is no law neither is there violation
5939,ROM,4,NRSV,for this reason it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of abraham for he is the father of all of us
5940,ROM,4,NRSV,as it is written i have made you the father of many nationsin the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist
5941,ROM,4,NRSV,hoping against hope he believed that he would become the father of many nations according to what was said so numerous shall your descendants be
5942,ROM,4,NRSV,he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body which was already
5943,ROM,4,NRSV,as good as dead for he was about a hundred years old or when he considered the barrenness of sarahs womb
5944,ROM,4,NRSV,no distrust made him waver concerning the promise of god but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to god
5945,ROM,4,NRSV,being fully convinced that god was able to do what he had promised
5946,ROM,4,NRSV,therefore his faith
5947,ROM,4,NRSV,was reckoned to him as righteousness
5948,ROM,4,NRSV,now the words it was reckoned to him were written not for his sake alone
5949,ROM,4,NRSV,but for ours also it will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead
5950,ROM,4,NRSV,who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification
5951,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore since we are justified by faith we
5952,ROM,5,NRSV,have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
5953,ROM,5,NRSV,through whom we have obtained access
5954,ROM,5,NRSV,to this grace in which we stand and we
5955,ROM,5,NRSV,boast in our hope of sharing the glory of god
5956,ROM,5,NRSV,and not only that but we
5957,ROM,5,NRSV,also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance
5958,ROM,5,NRSV,and endurance produces character and character produces hope
5959,ROM,5,NRSV,and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us
5960,ROM,5,NRSV,for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly
5961,ROM,5,NRSV,indeed rarely will anyone die for a righteous personthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die
5962,ROM,5,NRSV,but god proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners christ died for us
5963,ROM,5,NRSV,much more surely then now that we have been justified by his blood will we be saved through him from the wrath of god
5964,ROM,5,NRSV,for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more surely having been reconciled will we be saved by his life
5965,ROM,5,NRSV,but more than that we even boast in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation
5966,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and death came through sin and so death spread to all because all have sinned
5967,ROM,5,NRSV,sin was indeed in the world before the law but sin is not reckoned when there is no law
5968,ROM,5,NRSV,yet death exercised dominion from adam to moses even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of adam who is a type of the one who was to come
5969,ROM,5,NRSV,but the free gift is not like the trespass for if the many died through the one mans trespass much more surely have the grace of god and the free gift in the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded for the many
5970,ROM,5,NRSV,and the free gift is not like the effect of the one mans sin for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification
5971,ROM,5,NRSV,if because of the one mans trespass death exercised dominion through that one much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man jesus christ
5972,ROM,5,NRSV,therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all
5973,ROM,5,NRSV,for just as by the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners so by the one mans obedience the many will be made righteous
5974,ROM,5,NRSV,but law came in with the result that the trespass multiplied but where sin increased grace abounded all the more
5975,ROM,5,NRSV,so that just as sin exercised dominion in death so grace might also exercise dominion through justification
5976,ROM,5,NRSV,leading to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5977,ROM,6,NRSV,what then are we to say should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound
5978,ROM,6,NRSV,by no means how can we who died to sin go on living in it
5979,ROM,6,NRSV,do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death
5980,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life
5981,ROM,6,NRSV,for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his
5982,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed and we might no longer be enslaved to sin
5983,ROM,6,NRSV,for whoever has died is freed from sin
5984,ROM,6,NRSV,but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live with him
5985,ROM,6,NRSV,we know that christ being raised from the dead will never die again death no longer has dominion over him
5986,ROM,6,NRSV,the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god
5987,ROM,6,NRSV,so you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to god in christ jesus
5988,ROM,6,NRSV,therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies to make you obey their passions
5989,ROM,6,NRSV,no longer present your members to sin as instruments
5990,ROM,6,NRSV,of wickedness but present yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and present your members to god as instruments
5991,ROM,6,NRSV,of righteousness
5992,ROM,6,NRSV,for sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace
5993,ROM,6,NRSV,what then should we sin because we are not under law but under grace by no means
5994,ROM,6,NRSV,do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness
5995,ROM,6,NRSV,but thanks be to god that you having once been slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted
5996,ROM,6,NRSV,and that you having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness
5997,ROM,6,NRSV,i am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations
5998,ROM,6,NRSV,for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification
5999,ROM,6,NRSV,when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness
6000,ROM,6,NRSV,so what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed the end of those things is death
6001,ROM,6,NRSV,but now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to god the advantage you get is sanctification the end is eternal life
6002,ROM,6,NRSV,for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
6003,ROM,7,NRSV,do you not know brothers and sisters
6004,ROM,7,NRSV,for i am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only during that persons lifetime
6005,ROM,7,NRSV,thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband
6006,ROM,7,NRSV,accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive but if her husband dies she is free from that law and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress
6007,ROM,7,NRSV,in the same way my friends
6008,ROM,7,NRSV,you have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god
6009,ROM,7,NRSV,while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death
6010,ROM,7,NRSV,but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we are slaves not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit
6011,ROM,7,NRSV,what then should we say that the law is sin by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin i would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet
6012,ROM,7,NRSV,but sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness apart from the law sin lies dead
6013,ROM,7,NRSV,i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin revived
6014,ROM,7,NRSV,and i died and the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me
6015,ROM,7,NRSV,for sin seizing an opportunity in the commandment deceived me and through it killed me
6016,ROM,7,NRSV,so the law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good
6017,ROM,7,NRSV,did what is good then bring death to me by no means it was sin working death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure
6018,ROM,7,NRSV,for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold into slavery under sin
6019,ROM,7,NRSV,i do not understand my own actions for i do not do what i want but i do the very thing i hate
6020,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want i agree that the law is good
6021,ROM,7,NRSV,but in fact it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me
6022,ROM,7,NRSV,for i know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh i can will what is right but i cannot do it
6023,ROM,7,NRSV,for i do not do the good i want but the evil i do not want is what i do
6024,ROM,7,NRSV,now if i do what i do not want it is no longer i that do it but sin that dwells within me
6025,ROM,7,NRSV,so i find it to be a law that when i want to do what is good evil lies close at hand
6026,ROM,7,NRSV,for i delight in the law of god in my inmost self
6027,ROM,7,NRSV,but i see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members
6028,ROM,7,NRSV,wretched man that i am who will rescue me from this body of death
6029,ROM,7,NRSV,thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord
6030,ROM,7,NRSV,so then with my mind i am a slave to the law of god but with my flesh i am a slave to the law of sin
6031,ROM,8,NRSV,there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
6032,ROM,8,NRSV,for the law of the spirit
6033,ROM,8,NRSV,of life in christ jesus has set you
6034,ROM,8,NRSV,free from the law of sin and of death
6035,ROM,8,NRSV,for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and to deal with sin
6036,ROM,8,NRSV,he condemned sin in the flesh
6037,ROM,8,NRSV,so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit
6038,ROM,8,NRSV,for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit
6039,ROM,8,NRSV,set their minds on the things of the spirit
6040,ROM,8,NRSV,to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit
6041,ROM,8,NRSV,is life and peace
6042,ROM,8,NRSV,for this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods lawindeed it cannot
6043,ROM,8,NRSV,and those who are in the flesh cannot please god
6044,ROM,8,NRSV,but you are not in the flesh you are in the spirit
6045,ROM,8,NRSV,since the spirit of god dwells in you anyone who does not have the spirit of christ does not belong to him
6046,ROM,8,NRSV,but if christ is in you though the body is dead because of sin the spirit
6047,ROM,8,NRSV,is life because of righteousness
6048,ROM,8,NRSV,if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ
6049,ROM,8,NRSV,from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through
6050,ROM,8,NRSV,his spirit that dwells in you
6051,ROM,8,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters
6052,ROM,8,NRSV,we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh
6053,ROM,8,NRSV,for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live
6054,ROM,8,NRSV,for all who are led by the spirit of god are children of god
6055,ROM,8,NRSV,for you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear but you have received a spirit of adoption when we cry abba
6056,ROM,8,NRSV,father
6057,ROM,8,NRSV,it is that very spirit bearing witness
6058,ROM,8,NRSV,with our spirit that we are children of god
6059,ROM,8,NRSV,and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christif in fact we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him
6060,ROM,8,NRSV,i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us
6061,ROM,8,NRSV,for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god
6062,ROM,8,NRSV,for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope
6063,ROM,8,NRSV,that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god
6064,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now
6065,ROM,8,NRSV,and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies
6066,ROM,8,NRSV,for in
6067,ROM,8,NRSV,hope we were saved now hope that is seen is not hope for who hopes
6068,ROM,8,NRSV,for what is seen
6069,ROM,8,NRSV,but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience
6070,ROM,8,NRSV,likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but that very spirit intercedes
6071,ROM,8,NRSV,with sighs too deep for words
6072,ROM,8,NRSV,and god
6073,ROM,8,NRSV,who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit
6074,ROM,8,NRSV,intercedes for the saints according to the will of god
6075,ROM,8,NRSV,we know that all things work together for good
6076,ROM,8,NRSV,for those who love god who are called according to his purpose
6077,ROM,8,NRSV,for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family
6078,ROM,8,NRSV,and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified
6079,ROM,8,NRSV,what then are we to say about these things if god is for us who is against us
6080,ROM,8,NRSV,he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us everything else
6081,ROM,8,NRSV,who will bring any charge against gods elect it is god who justifies
6082,ROM,8,NRSV,who is to condemn it is christ jesus who died yes who was raised who is at the right hand of god who indeed intercedes for us
6083,ROM,8,NRSV,who will separate us from the love of christ will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
6084,ROM,8,NRSV,as it is written
6085,ROM,8,NRSV,for your sake we are being killed all day long
6086,ROM,8,NRSV,we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered
6087,ROM,8,NRSV,no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us
6088,ROM,8,NRSV,for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers
6089,ROM,8,NRSV,nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord
6090,ROM,9,NRSV,i am speaking the truth in christi am not lying my conscience confirms it by the holy spirit
6091,ROM,9,NRSV,i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart
6092,ROM,9,NRSV,for i could wish that i myself were accursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my own people
6093,ROM,9,NRSV,my kindred according to the flesh
6094,ROM,9,NRSV,they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises
6095,ROM,9,NRSV,to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah
6096,ROM,9,NRSV,who is over all god blessed forever
6097,ROM,9,NRSV,amen
6098,ROM,9,NRSV,it is not as though the word of god had failed for not all israelites truly belong to israel
6099,ROM,9,NRSV,and not all of abrahams children are his true descendants but it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you
6100,ROM,9,NRSV,this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of god but the children of the promise are counted as descendants
6101,ROM,9,NRSV,for this is what the promise said about this time i will return and sarah shall have a son
6102,ROM,9,NRSV,nor is that all something similar happened to rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband our ancestor isaac
6103,ROM,9,NRSV,even before they had been born or had done anything good or bad so that gods purpose of election might continue
6104,ROM,9,NRSV,not by works but by his call she was told the elder shall serve the younger
6105,ROM,9,NRSV,as it is written
6106,ROM,9,NRSV,i have loved jacob
6107,ROM,9,NRSV,but i have hated esau
6108,ROM,9,NRSV,what then are we to say is there injustice on gods part by no means
6109,ROM,9,NRSV,for he says to moses
6110,ROM,9,NRSV,i will have mercy on whom i have mercy
6111,ROM,9,NRSV,and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
6112,ROM,9,NRSV,so it depends not on human will or exertion but on god who shows mercy
6113,ROM,9,NRSV,for the scripture says to pharaoh i have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth
6114,ROM,9,NRSV,so then he has mercy on whomever he chooses and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses
6115,ROM,9,NRSV,you will say to me then why then does he still find fault for who can resist his will
6116,ROM,9,NRSV,but who indeed are you a human being to argue with god will what is molded say to the one who molds it why have you made me like this
6117,ROM,9,NRSV,has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use
6118,ROM,9,NRSV,what if god desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction
6119,ROM,9,NRSV,and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy which he has prepared beforehand for glory
6120,ROM,9,NRSV,including us whom he has called not from the jews only but also from the gentiles
6121,ROM,9,NRSV,as indeed he says in hosea
6122,ROM,9,NRSV,those who were not my people i will call my people
6123,ROM,9,NRSV,and her who was not beloved i will call beloved
6124,ROM,9,NRSV,and in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people
6125,ROM,9,NRSV,there they shall be called children of the living god
6126,ROM,9,NRSV,and isaiah cries out concerning israel though the number of the children of israel were like the sand of the sea only a remnant of them will be saved
6127,ROM,9,NRSV,for the lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively
6128,ROM,9,NRSV,and as isaiah predicted
6129,ROM,9,NRSV,if the lord of hosts had not left survivors
6130,ROM,9,NRSV,to us
6131,ROM,9,NRSV,we would have fared like sodom
6132,ROM,9,NRSV,and been made like gomorrah
6133,ROM,9,NRSV,what then are we to say gentiles who did not strive for righteousness have attained it that is righteousness through faith
6134,ROM,9,NRSV,but israel who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law did not succeed in fulfilling that law
6135,ROM,9,NRSV,why not because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith but as if it were based on works they have stumbled over the stumbling stone
6136,ROM,9,NRSV,as it is written
6137,ROM,9,NRSV,see i am laying in zion a stone that will make people stumble a rock that will make them fall
6138,ROM,9,NRSV,and whoever believes in him
6139,ROM,9,NRSV,will not be put to shame
6140,ROM,10,NRSV,brothers and sisters
6141,ROM,10,NRSV,my hearts desire and prayer to god for them is that they may be saved
6142,ROM,10,NRSV,i can testify that they have a zeal for god but it is not enlightened
6143,ROM,10,NRSV,for being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from god and seeking to establish their own they have not submitted to gods righteousness
6144,ROM,10,NRSV,for christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes
6145,ROM,10,NRSV,moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law that the person who does these things will live by them
6146,ROM,10,NRSV,but the righteousness that comes from faith says do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down
6147,ROM,10,NRSV,or who will descend into the abyss that is to bring christ up from the dead
6148,ROM,10,NRSV,but what does it say
6149,ROM,10,NRSV,the word is near you
6150,ROM,10,NRSV,on your lips and in your heart
6151,ROM,10,NRSV,that is the word of faith that we proclaim
6152,ROM,10,NRSV,because
6153,ROM,10,NRSV,if you confess with your lips that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
6154,ROM,10,NRSV,for one believes with the heart and so is justified and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved
6155,ROM,10,NRSV,the scripture says no one who believes in him will be put to shame
6156,ROM,10,NRSV,for there is no distinction between jew and greek the same lord is lord of all and is generous to all who call on him
6157,ROM,10,NRSV,for everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
6158,ROM,10,NRSV,but how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed and how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard and how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him
6159,ROM,10,NRSV,and how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news
6160,ROM,10,NRSV,but not all have obeyed the good news
6161,ROM,10,NRSV,for isaiah says lord who has believed our message
6162,ROM,10,NRSV,so faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes through the word of christ
6163,ROM,10,NRSV,but i ask have they not heard indeed they have for
6164,ROM,10,NRSV,their voice has gone out to all the earth
6165,ROM,10,NRSV,and their words to the ends of the world
6166,ROM,10,NRSV,again i ask did israel not understand first moses says
6167,ROM,10,NRSV,i will make you jealous of those who are not a nation
6168,ROM,10,NRSV,with a foolish nation i will make you angry
6169,ROM,10,NRSV,then isaiah is so bold as to say
6170,ROM,10,NRSV,i have been found by those who did not seek me
6171,ROM,10,NRSV,i have shown myself to those who did not ask for me
6172,ROM,10,NRSV,but of israel he says all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people
6173,ROM,11,NRSV,i ask then has god rejected his people by no means i myself am an israelite a descendant of abraham a member of the tribe of benjamin
6174,ROM,11,NRSV,god has not rejected his people whom he foreknew do you not know what the scripture says of elijah how he pleads with god against israel
6175,ROM,11,NRSV,lord they have killed your prophets they have demolished your altars i alone am left and they are seeking my life
6176,ROM,11,NRSV,but what is the divine reply to him i have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal
6177,ROM,11,NRSV,so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace
6178,ROM,11,NRSV,but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace
6179,ROM,11,NRSV,what then israel failed to obtain what it was seeking the elect obtained it but the rest were hardened
6180,ROM,11,NRSV,as it is written
6181,ROM,11,NRSV,god gave them a sluggish spirit
6182,ROM,11,NRSV,eyes that would not see
6183,ROM,11,NRSV,and ears that would not hear
6184,ROM,11,NRSV,down to this very day
6185,ROM,11,NRSV,and david says
6186,ROM,11,NRSV,let their table become a snare and a trap
6187,ROM,11,NRSV,a stumbling block and a retribution for them
6188,ROM,11,NRSV,let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see
6189,ROM,11,NRSV,and keep their backs forever bent
6190,ROM,11,NRSV,so i ask have they stumbled so as to fall by no means but through their stumbling
6191,ROM,11,NRSV,salvation has come to the gentiles so as to make israel
6192,ROM,11,NRSV,jealous
6193,ROM,11,NRSV,now if their stumbling
6194,ROM,11,NRSV,means riches for the world and if their defeat means riches for gentiles how much more will their full inclusion mean
6195,ROM,11,NRSV,now i am speaking to you gentiles inasmuch then as i am an apostle to the gentiles i glorify my ministry
6196,ROM,11,NRSV,in order to make my own people
6197,ROM,11,NRSV,jealous and thus save some of them
6198,ROM,11,NRSV,for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead
6199,ROM,11,NRSV,if the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy then the whole batch is holy and if the root is holy then the branches also are holy
6200,ROM,11,NRSV,but if some of the branches were broken off and you a wild olive shoot were grafted in their place to share the rich root
6201,ROM,11,NRSV,of the olive tree
6202,ROM,11,NRSV,do not boast over the branches if you do boast remember that it is not you that support the root but the root that supports you
6203,ROM,11,NRSV,you will say branches were broken off so that i might be grafted in
6204,ROM,11,NRSV,that is true they were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand only through faith so do not become proud but stand in awe
6205,ROM,11,NRSV,for if god did not spare the natural branches perhaps he will not spare you
6206,ROM,11,NRSV,note then the kindness and the severity of god severity toward those who have fallen but gods kindness toward you provided you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off
6207,ROM,11,NRSV,and even those of israel
6208,ROM,11,NRSV,if they do not persist in unbelief will be grafted in for god has the power to graft them in again
6209,ROM,11,NRSV,for if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree
6210,ROM,11,NRSV,so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters
6211,ROM,11,NRSV,i want you to understand this mystery a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of the gentiles has come in
6212,ROM,11,NRSV,and so all israel will be saved as it is written
6213,ROM,11,NRSV,out of zion will come the deliverer
6214,ROM,11,NRSV,he will banish ungodliness from jacob
6215,ROM,11,NRSV,and this is my covenant with them
6216,ROM,11,NRSV,when i take away their sins
6217,ROM,11,NRSV,as regards the gospel they are enemies of god
6218,ROM,11,NRSV,for your sake but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their ancestors
6219,ROM,11,NRSV,for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable
6220,ROM,11,NRSV,just as you were once disobedient to god but have now received mercy because of their disobedience
6221,ROM,11,NRSV,so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they too may now
6222,ROM,11,NRSV,receive mercy
6223,ROM,11,NRSV,for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all
6224,ROM,11,NRSV,o the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways
6225,ROM,11,NRSV,for who has known the mind of the lord
6226,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has been his counselor
6227,ROM,11,NRSV,or who has given a gift to him
6228,ROM,11,NRSV,to receive a gift in return
6229,ROM,11,NRSV,for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory forever amen
6230,ROM,12,NRSV,i appeal to you therefore brothers and sisters
6231,ROM,12,NRSV,by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual
6232,ROM,12,NRSV,worship
6233,ROM,12,NRSV,do not be conformed to this world
6234,ROM,12,NRSV,but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of godwhat is good and acceptable and perfect
6235,ROM,12,NRSV,for by the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has assigned
6236,ROM,12,NRSV,for as in one body we have many members and not all the members have the same function
6237,ROM,12,NRSV,so we who are many are one body in christ and individually we are members one of another
6238,ROM,12,NRSV,we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith
6239,ROM,12,NRSV,ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching
6240,ROM,12,NRSV,the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness
6241,ROM,12,NRSV,let love be genuine hate what is evil hold fast to what is good
6242,ROM,12,NRSV,love one another with mutual affection outdo one another in showing honor
6243,ROM,12,NRSV,do not lag in zeal be ardent in spirit serve the lord
6244,ROM,12,NRSV,rejoice in hope be patient in suffering persevere in prayer
6245,ROM,12,NRSV,contribute to the needs of the saints extend hospitality to strangers
6246,ROM,12,NRSV,bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse them
6247,ROM,12,NRSV,rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep
6248,ROM,12,NRSV,live in harmony with one another do not be haughty but associate with the lowly
6249,ROM,12,NRSV,do not claim to be wiser than you are
6250,ROM,12,NRSV,do not repay anyone evil for evil but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all
6251,ROM,12,NRSV,if it is possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with all
6252,ROM,12,NRSV,beloved never avenge yourselves but leave room for the wrath of god
6253,ROM,12,NRSV,for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord
6254,ROM,12,NRSV,no if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads
6255,ROM,12,NRSV,do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
6256,ROM,13,NRSV,let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those authorities that exist have been instituted by god
6257,ROM,13,NRSV,therefore whoever resists authority resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment
6258,ROM,13,NRSV,for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad do you wish to have no fear of the authority then do what is good and you will receive its approval
6259,ROM,13,NRSV,for it is gods servant for your good but if you do what is wrong you should be afraid for the authority
6260,ROM,13,NRSV,does not bear the sword in vain it is the servant of god to execute wrath on the wrongdoer
6261,ROM,13,NRSV,therefore one must be subject not only because of wrath but also because of conscience
6262,ROM,13,NRSV,for the same reason you also pay taxes for the authorities are gods servants busy with this very thing
6263,ROM,13,NRSV,pay to all what is due themtaxes to whom taxes are due revenue to whom revenue is due respect to whom respect is due honor to whom honor is due
6264,ROM,13,NRSV,owe no one anything except to love one another for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law
6265,ROM,13,NRSV,the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and any other commandment are summed up in this word love your neighbor as yourself
6266,ROM,13,NRSV,love does no wrong to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
6267,ROM,13,NRSV,besides this you know what time it is how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers
6268,ROM,13,NRSV,the night is far gone the day is near let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light
6269,ROM,13,NRSV,let us live honorably as in the day not in reveling and drunkenness not in debauchery and licentiousness not in quarreling and jealousy
6270,ROM,13,NRSV,instead put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires
6271,ROM,14,NRSV,welcome those who are weak in faith
6272,ROM,14,NRSV,but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions
6273,ROM,14,NRSV,some believe in eating anything while the weak eat only vegetables
6274,ROM,14,NRSV,those who eat must not despise those who abstain and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat for god has welcomed them
6275,ROM,14,NRSV,who are you to pass judgment on servants of another it is before their own lord that they stand or fall and they will be upheld for the lord
6276,ROM,14,NRSV,is able to make them stand
6277,ROM,14,NRSV,some judge one day to be better than another while others judge all days to be alike let all be fully convinced in their own minds
6278,ROM,14,NRSV,those who observe the day observe it in honor of the lord also those who eat eat in honor of the lord since they give thanks to god while those who abstain abstain in honor of the lord and give thanks to god
6279,ROM,14,NRSV,we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves
6280,ROM,14,NRSV,if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords
6281,ROM,14,NRSV,for to this end christ died and lived again so that he might be lord of both the dead and the living
6282,ROM,14,NRSV,why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister
6283,ROM,14,NRSV,or you why do you despise your brother or sister
6284,ROM,14,NRSV,for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god
6285,ROM,14,NRSV,for it is written
6286,ROM,14,NRSV,as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me
6287,ROM,14,NRSV,and every tongue shall give praise to
6288,ROM,14,NRSV,god
6289,ROM,14,NRSV,so then each of us will be accountable to god
6290,ROM,14,NRSV,let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another but resolve instead never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of another
6291,ROM,14,NRSV,i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean
6292,ROM,14,NRSV,if your brother or sister
6293,ROM,14,NRSV,is being injured by what you eat you are no longer walking in love do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom christ died
6294,ROM,14,NRSV,so do not let your good be spoken of as evil
6295,ROM,14,NRSV,for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
6296,ROM,14,NRSV,the one who thus serves christ is acceptable to god and has human approval
6297,ROM,14,NRSV,let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding
6298,ROM,14,NRSV,do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god everything is indeed clean but it is wrong for you to make others fall by what you eat
6299,ROM,14,NRSV,it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother or sister
6300,ROM,14,NRSV,stumble
6301,ROM,14,NRSV,the faith that you have have as your own conviction before god blessed are those who have no reason to condemn themselves because of what they approve
6302,ROM,14,NRSV,but those who have doubts are condemned if they eat because they do not act from faith
6303,ROM,14,NRSV,for whatever does not proceed from faith
6304,ROM,14,NRSV,is sin
6305,ROM,15,NRSV,we who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves
6306,ROM,15,NRSV,each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor
6307,ROM,15,NRSV,for christ did not please himself but as it is written the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me
6308,ROM,15,NRSV,for whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope
6309,ROM,15,NRSV,may the god of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another in accordance with christ jesus
6310,ROM,15,NRSV,so that together you may with one voice glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ
6311,ROM,15,NRSV,welcome one another therefore just as christ has welcomed you for the glory of god
6312,ROM,15,NRSV,for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of god in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs
6313,ROM,15,NRSV,and in order that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it is written
6314,ROM,15,NRSV,therefore i will confess
6315,ROM,15,NRSV,you among the gentiles
6316,ROM,15,NRSV,and sing praises to your name
6317,ROM,15,NRSV,and again he says
6318,ROM,15,NRSV,rejoice o gentiles with his people
6319,ROM,15,NRSV,and again
6320,ROM,15,NRSV,praise the lord all you gentiles
6321,ROM,15,NRSV,and let all the peoples praise him
6322,ROM,15,NRSV,and again isaiah says
6323,ROM,15,NRSV,the root of jesse shall come
6324,ROM,15,NRSV,the one who rises to rule the gentiles
6325,ROM,15,NRSV,in him the gentiles shall hope
6326,ROM,15,NRSV,may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy spirit
6327,ROM,15,NRSV,i myself feel confident about you my brothers and sisters
6328,ROM,15,NRSV,that you yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another
6329,ROM,15,NRSV,nevertheless on some points i have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder because of the grace given me by god
6330,ROM,15,NRSV,to be a minister of christ jesus to the gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of god so that the offering of the gentiles may be acceptable sanctified by the holy spirit
6331,ROM,15,NRSV,in christ jesus then i have reason to boast of my work for god
6332,ROM,15,NRSV,for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished
6333,ROM,15,NRSV,through me to win obedience from the gentiles by word and deed
6334,ROM,15,NRSV,by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god
6335,ROM,15,NRSV,so that from jerusalem and as far around as illyricum i have fully proclaimed the good news
6336,ROM,15,NRSV,of christ
6337,ROM,15,NRSV,thus i make it my ambition to proclaim the good news
6338,ROM,15,NRSV,not where christ has already been named so that i do not build on someone elses foundation
6339,ROM,15,NRSV,but as it is written
6340,ROM,15,NRSV,those who have never been told of him shall see
6341,ROM,15,NRSV,and those who have never heard of him shall understand
6342,ROM,15,NRSV,this is the reason that i have so often been hindered from coming to you
6343,ROM,15,NRSV,but now with no further place for me in these regions i desire as i have for many years to come to you
6344,ROM,15,NRSV,when i go to spain for i do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you once i have enjoyed your company for a little while
6345,ROM,15,NRSV,at present however i am going to jerusalem in a ministry to the saints
6346,ROM,15,NRSV,for macedonia and achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at jerusalem
6347,ROM,15,NRSV,they were pleased to do this and indeed they owe it to them for if the gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings they ought also to be of service to them in material things
6348,ROM,15,NRSV,so when i have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected
6349,ROM,15,NRSV,i will set out by way of you to spain
6350,ROM,15,NRSV,and i know that when i come to you i will come in the fullness of the blessing
6351,ROM,15,NRSV,of christ
6352,ROM,15,NRSV,i appeal to you brothers and sisters
6353,ROM,15,NRSV,by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit to join me in earnest prayer to god on my behalf
6354,ROM,15,NRSV,that i may be rescued from the unbelievers in judea and that my ministry
6355,ROM,15,NRSV,to jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints
6356,ROM,15,NRSV,so that by gods will i may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company
6357,ROM,15,NRSV,the god of peace be with all of you
6358,ROM,15,NRSV,amen
6359,ROM,16,NRSV,i commend to you our sister phoebe a deacon
6360,ROM,16,NRSV,of the church at cenchreae
6361,ROM,16,NRSV,so that you may welcome her in the lord as is fitting for the saints and help her in whatever she may require from you for she has been a benefactor of many and of myself as well
6362,ROM,16,NRSV,greet prisca and aquila who work with me in christ jesus

6376,ROM,16,NRSV,greet rufus chosen in the lord and greet his mothera mother to me also
6377,ROM,16,NRSV,greet asyncritus phlegon hermes patrobas hermas and the brothers and sisters
6378,ROM,16,NRSV,who are with them
6379,ROM,16,NRSV,greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them
6380,ROM,16,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss all the churches of christ greet you
6381,ROM,16,NRSV,i urge you brothers and sisters
6382,ROM,16,NRSV,to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offenses in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them
6383,ROM,16,NRSV,for such people do not serve our lord christ but their own appetites
6384,ROM,16,NRSV,and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the simpleminded
6385,ROM,16,NRSV,for while your obedience is known to all so that i rejoice over you i want you to be wise in what is good and guileless in what is evil
6386,ROM,16,NRSV,the god of peace will shortly crush satan under your feet the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you

6392,ROM,16,NRSV,but is now disclosed and through the prophetic writings is made known to all the gentiles according to the command of the eternal god to bring about the obedience of faith
6393,ROM,16,NRSV,to the only wise god through jesus christ to whom
6394,ROM,16,NRSV,be the glory forever amen
6395,1CO,1,NRSV,paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and our brother sosthenes
6396,1CO,1,NRSV,to the church of god that is in corinth to those who are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our lord jesus christ both their lord
6397,1CO,1,NRSV,and ours
6398,1CO,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
6399,1CO,1,NRSV,i give thanks to my
6400,1CO,1,NRSV,god always for you because of the grace of god that has been given you in christ jesus
6401,1CO,1,NRSV,for in every way you have been enriched in him in speech and knowledge of every kind
6402,1CO,1,NRSV,just as the testimony of
6403,1CO,1,NRSV,christ has been strengthened among you
6404,1CO,1,NRSV,so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our lord jesus christ
6405,1CO,1,NRSV,he will also strengthen you to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ
6406,1CO,1,NRSV,god is faithful by him you were called into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord
6407,1CO,1,NRSV,now i appeal to you brothers and sisters
6408,1CO,1,NRSV,by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose
6409,1CO,1,NRSV,for it has been reported to me by chloes people that there are quarrels among you my brothers and sisters
6410,1CO,1,NRSV,what i mean is that each of you says i belong to paul or i belong to apollos or i belong to cephas or i belong to christ
6411,1CO,1,NRSV,has christ been divided was paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of paul
6412,1CO,1,NRSV,i thank god
6413,1CO,1,NRSV,that i baptized none of you except crispus and gaius
6414,1CO,1,NRSV,so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name
6415,1CO,1,NRSV,i did baptize also the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know whether i baptized anyone else
6416,1CO,1,NRSV,for christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel and not with eloquent wisdom so that the cross of christ might not be emptied of its power
6417,1CO,1,NRSV,for the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
6418,1CO,1,NRSV,for it is written
6419,1CO,1,NRSV,i will destroy the wisdom of the wise
6420,1CO,1,NRSV,and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart
6421,1CO,1,NRSV,where is the one who is wise where is the scribe where is the debater of this age has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world
6422,1CO,1,NRSV,for since in the wisdom of god the world did not know god through wisdom god decided through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe
6423,1CO,1,NRSV,for jews demand signs and greeks desire wisdom
6424,1CO,1,NRSV,but we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles
6425,1CO,1,NRSV,but to those who are the called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
6426,1CO,1,NRSV,for gods foolishness is wiser than human wisdom and gods weakness is stronger than human strength
6427,1CO,1,NRSV,consider your own call brothers and sisters
6428,1CO,1,NRSV,not many of you were wise by human standards
6429,1CO,1,NRSV,not many were powerful not many were of noble birth
6430,1CO,1,NRSV,but god chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise god chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong
6431,1CO,1,NRSV,god chose what is low and despised in the world things that are not to reduce to nothing things that are
6432,1CO,1,NRSV,so that no one
6433,1CO,1,NRSV,might boast in the presence of god
6434,1CO,1,NRSV,he is the source of your life in christ jesus who became for us wisdom from god and righteousness and sanctification and redemption
6435,1CO,1,NRSV,in order that as it is written let the one who boasts boast in
6436,1CO,1,NRSV,the lord
6437,1CO,2,NRSV,when i came to you brothers and sisters
6438,1CO,2,NRSV,i did not come proclaiming the mystery
6439,1CO,2,NRSV,of god to you in lofty words or wisdom
6440,1CO,2,NRSV,for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified
6441,1CO,2,NRSV,and i came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling
6442,1CO,2,NRSV,my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom
6443,1CO,2,NRSV,but with a demonstration of the spirit and of power
6444,1CO,2,NRSV,so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of god
6445,1CO,2,NRSV,yet among the mature we do speak wisdom though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are doomed to perish
6446,1CO,2,NRSV,but we speak gods wisdom secret and hidden which god decreed before the ages for our glory
6447,1CO,2,NRSV,none of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory
6448,1CO,2,NRSV,but as it is written
6449,1CO,2,NRSV,what no eye has seen nor ear heard
6450,1CO,2,NRSV,nor the human heart conceived
6451,1CO,2,NRSV,what god has prepared for those who love him
6452,1CO,2,NRSV,these things god has revealed to us through the spirit for the spirit searches everything even the depths of god
6453,1CO,2,NRSV,for what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within so also no one comprehends what is truly gods except the spirit of god
6454,1CO,2,NRSV,now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is from god so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by god
6455,1CO,2,NRSV,and we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the spirit interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual
6456,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are unspiritual
6457,1CO,2,NRSV,do not receive the gifts of gods spirit for they are foolishness to them and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned
6458,1CO,2,NRSV,those who are spiritual discern all things and they are themselves subject to no one elses scrutiny
6459,1CO,2,NRSV,for who has known the mind of the lord
6460,1CO,2,NRSV,so as to instruct him
6461,1CO,2,NRSV,but we have the mind of christ
6462,1CO,3,NRSV,and so brothers and sisters
6463,1CO,3,NRSV,i could not speak to you as spiritual people but rather as people of the flesh as infants in christ
6464,1CO,3,NRSV,i fed you with milk not solid food for you were not ready for solid food even now you are still not ready
6465,1CO,3,NRSV,for you are still of the flesh for as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not of the flesh and behaving according to human inclinations
6466,1CO,3,NRSV,for when one says i belong to paul and another i belong to apollos are you not merely human
6467,1CO,3,NRSV,what then is apollos what is paul servants through whom you came to believe as the lord assigned to each
6468,1CO,3,NRSV,i planted apollos watered but god gave the growth
6469,1CO,3,NRSV,so neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything but only god who gives the growth
6470,1CO,3,NRSV,the one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose and each will receive wages according to the labor of each
6471,1CO,3,NRSV,for we are gods servants working together you are gods field gods building
6472,1CO,3,NRSV,according to the grace of god given to me like a skilled master builder i laid a foundation and someone else is building on it each builder must choose with care how to build on it
6473,1CO,3,NRSV,for no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid that foundation is jesus christ
6474,1CO,3,NRSV,now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw
6475,1CO,3,NRSV,the work of each builder will become visible for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test what sort of work each has done
6476,1CO,3,NRSV,if what has been built on the foundation survives the builder will receive a reward
6477,1CO,3,NRSV,if the work is burned up the builder will suffer loss the builder will be saved but only as through fire
6478,1CO,3,NRSV,do you not know that you are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells in you
6479,1CO,3,NRSV,if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person for gods temple is holy and you are that temple
6480,1CO,3,NRSV,do not deceive yourselves if you think that you are wise in this age you should become fools so that you may become wise
6481,1CO,3,NRSV,for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written
6482,1CO,3,NRSV,he catches the wise in their craftiness
6483,1CO,3,NRSV,and again
6484,1CO,3,NRSV,the lord knows the thoughts of the wise
6485,1CO,3,NRSV,that they are futile
6486,1CO,3,NRSV,so let no one boast about human leaders for all things are yours
6487,1CO,3,NRSV,whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the futureall belong to you
6488,1CO,3,NRSV,and you belong to christ and christ belongs to god
6489,1CO,4,NRSV,think of us in this way as servants of christ and stewards of gods mysteries
6490,1CO,4,NRSV,moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy
6491,1CO,4,NRSV,but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court i do not even judge myself
6492,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not aware of anything against myself but i am not thereby acquitted it is the lord who judges me
6493,1CO,4,NRSV,therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart then each one will receive commendation from god
6494,1CO,4,NRSV,i have applied all this to apollos and myself for your benefit brothers and sisters
6495,1CO,4,NRSV,so that you may learn through us the meaning of the saying nothing beyond what is written so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another
6496,1CO,4,NRSV,for who sees anything different in you
6497,1CO,4,NRSV,what do you have that you did not receive and if you received it why do you boast as if it were not a gift
6498,1CO,4,NRSV,already you have all you want already you have become rich quite apart from us you have become kings indeed i wish that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you
6499,1CO,4,NRSV,for i think that god has exhibited us apostles as last of all as though sentenced to death because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to mortals
6500,1CO,4,NRSV,we are fools for the sake of christ but you are wise in christ we are weak but you are strong you are held in honor but we in disrepute
6501,1CO,4,NRSV,to the present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless
6502,1CO,4,NRSV,and we grow weary from the work of our own hands when reviled we bless when persecuted we endure
6503,1CO,4,NRSV,when slandered we speak kindly we have become like the rubbish of the world the dregs of all things to this very day
6504,1CO,4,NRSV,i am not writing this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children
6505,1CO,4,NRSV,for though you might have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers indeed in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel
6506,1CO,4,NRSV,i appeal to you then be imitators of me
6507,1CO,4,NRSV,for this reason i sent
6508,1CO,4,NRSV,you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord to remind you of my ways in christ jesus as i teach them everywhere in every church
6509,1CO,4,NRSV,but some of you thinking that i am not coming to you have become arrogant
6510,1CO,4,NRSV,but i will come to you soon if the lord wills and i will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power
6511,1CO,4,NRSV,for the kingdom of god depends not on talk but on power
6512,1CO,4,NRSV,what would you prefer am i to come to you with a stick or with love in a spirit of gentleness
6513,1CO,5,NRSV,it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that is not found even among pagans for a man is living with his fathers wife
6514,1CO,5,NRSV,and you are arrogant should you not rather have mourned so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you
6515,1CO,5,NRSV,for though absent in body i am present in spirit and as if present i have already pronounced judgment
6516,1CO,5,NRSV,in the name of the lord jesus on the man who has done such a thing
6517,1CO,5,NRSV,when you are assembled and my spirit is present with the power of our lord jesus
6518,1CO,5,NRSV,you are to hand this man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the lord
6519,1CO,5,NRSV,your boasting is not a good thing do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough
6520,1CO,5,NRSV,clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch as you really are unleavened for our paschal lamb christ has been sacrificed
6521,1CO,5,NRSV,therefore let us celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
6522,1CO,5,NRSV,i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral persons
6523,1CO,5,NRSV,not at all meaning the immoral of this world or the greedy and robbers or idolaters since you would then need to go out of the world
6524,1CO,5,NRSV,but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother or sister
6525,1CO,5,NRSV,who is sexually immoral or greedy or is an idolater reviler drunkard or robber do not even eat with such a one
6526,1CO,5,NRSV,for what have i to do with judging those outside is it not those who are inside that you are to judge
6527,1CO,5,NRSV,god will judge those outside drive out the wicked person from among you
6528,1CO,6,NRSV,when any of you has a grievance against another do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it before the saints
6529,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that the saints will judge the world and if the world is to be judged by you are you incompetent to try trivial cases
6530,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that we are to judge angelsto say nothing of ordinary matters
6531,1CO,6,NRSV,if you have ordinary cases then do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church
6532,1CO,6,NRSV,i say this to your shame can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to decide between one believer
6533,1CO,6,NRSV,and another
6534,1CO,6,NRSV,but a believer
6535,1CO,6,NRSV,goes to court against a believer
6536,1CO,6,NRSV,and before unbelievers at that
6537,1CO,6,NRSV,in fact to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you why not rather be wronged why not rather be defrauded
6538,1CO,6,NRSV,but you yourselves wrong and defraudand believers
6539,1CO,6,NRSV,at that
6540,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived fornicators idolaters adulterers male prostitutes sodomites
6541,1CO,6,NRSV,thieves the greedy drunkards revilers robbersnone of these will inherit the kingdom of god
6542,1CO,6,NRSV,and this is what some of you used to be but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god
6543,1CO,6,NRSV,all things are lawful for me but not all things are beneficial all things are lawful for me but i will not be dominated by anything
6544,1CO,6,NRSV,food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food
6545,1CO,6,NRSV,and god will destroy both one and the other the body is meant not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body
6546,1CO,6,NRSV,and god raised the lord and will also raise us by his power
6547,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that your bodies are members of christ should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute never
6548,1CO,6,NRSV,do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her for it is said the two shall be one flesh
6549,1CO,6,NRSV,but anyone united to the lord becomes one spirit with him
6550,1CO,6,NRSV,shun fornication every sin that a person commits is outside the body but the fornicator sins against the body itself
6551,1CO,6,NRSV,or do you not know that your body is a temple
6552,1CO,6,NRSV,of the holy spirit within you which you have from god and that you are not your own
6553,1CO,6,NRSV,for you were bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body
6554,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning the matters about which you wrote it is well for a man not to touch a woman
6555,1CO,7,NRSV,but because of cases of sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband
6556,1CO,7,NRSV,the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband
6557,1CO,7,NRSV,for the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does
6558,1CO,7,NRSV,do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer and then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol
6559,1CO,7,NRSV,this i say by way of concession not of command
6560,1CO,7,NRSV,i wish that all were as i myself am but each has a particular gift from god one having one kind and another a different kind
6561,1CO,7,NRSV,to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as i am
6562,1CO,7,NRSV,but if they are not practicing selfcontrol they should marry for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion
6563,1CO,7,NRSV,to the married i give this commandnot i but the lordthat the wife should not separate from her husband
6564,1CO,7,NRSV,but if she does separate let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and that the husband should not divorce his wife
6565,1CO,7,NRSV,to the rest i sayi and not the lordthat if any believer
6566,1CO,7,NRSV,has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him he should not divorce her
6567,1CO,7,NRSV,and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her she should not divorce him
6568,1CO,7,NRSV,for the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband otherwise your children would be unclean but as it is they are holy
6569,1CO,7,NRSV,but if the unbelieving partner separates let it be so in such a case the brother or sister is not bound it is to peace that god has called you
6570,1CO,7,NRSV,wife for all you know you might save your husband husband for all you know you might save your wife
6571,1CO,7,NRSV,however that may be let each of you lead the life that the lord has assigned to which god called you this is my rule in all the churches
6572,1CO,7,NRSV,was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised let him not seek circumcision
6573,1CO,7,NRSV,circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but obeying the commandments of god is everything
6574,1CO,7,NRSV,let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called
6575,1CO,7,NRSV,were you a slave when called do not be concerned about it even if you can gain your freedom make use of your present condition now more than ever
6576,1CO,7,NRSV,for whoever was called in the lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the lord just as whoever was free when called is a slave of christ
6577,1CO,7,NRSV,you were bought with a price do not become slaves of human masters
6578,1CO,7,NRSV,in whatever condition you were called brothers and sisters
6579,1CO,7,NRSV,there remain with god
6580,1CO,7,NRSV,now concerning virgins i have no command of the lord but i give my opinion as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy
6581,1CO,7,NRSV,i think that in view of the impending
6582,1CO,7,NRSV,crisis it is well for you to remain as you are
6583,1CO,7,NRSV,are you bound to a wife do not seek to be free are you free from a wife do not seek a wife
6584,1CO,7,NRSV,but if you marry you do not sin and if a virgin marries she does not sin yet those who marry will experience distress in this life
6585,1CO,7,NRSV,and i would spare you that
6586,1CO,7,NRSV,i mean brothers and sisters
6587,1CO,7,NRSV,the appointed time has grown short from now on let even those who have wives be as though they had none
6588,1CO,7,NRSV,and those who mourn as though they were not mourning and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they had no possessions
6589,1CO,7,NRSV,and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it for the present form of this world is passing away
6590,1CO,7,NRSV,i want you to be free from anxieties the unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the lord how to please the lord
6591,1CO,7,NRSV,but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please his wife
6592,1CO,7,NRSV,and his interests are divided and the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the lord so that they may be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world how to please her husband
6593,1CO,7,NRSV,i say this for your own benefit not to put any restraint upon you but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the lord
6594,1CO,7,NRSV,if anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancee
6595,1CO,7,NRSV,if his passions are strong and so it has to be let him marry as he wishes it is no sin let them marry
6596,1CO,7,NRSV,but if someone stands firm in his resolve being under no necessity but having his own desire under control and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancee
6597,1CO,7,NRSV,he will do well
6598,1CO,7,NRSV,so then he who marries his fiancee
6599,1CO,7,NRSV,does well and he who refrains from marriage will do better
6600,1CO,7,NRSV,a wife is bound as long as her husband lives but if the husband dies
6601,1CO,7,NRSV,she is free to marry anyone she wishes only in the lord
6602,1CO,7,NRSV,but in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is and i think that i too have the spirit of god
6603,1CO,8,NRSV,now concerning food sacrificed to idols we know that all of us possess knowledge knowledge puffs up but love builds up
6604,1CO,8,NRSV,anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge
6605,1CO,8,NRSV,but anyone who loves god is known by him
6606,1CO,8,NRSV,hence as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that no idol in the world really exists and that there is no god but one
6607,1CO,8,NRSV,indeed even though there may be socalled gods in heaven or on earthas in fact there are many gods and many lords
6608,1CO,8,NRSV,yet for us there is one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and through whom we exist
6609,1CO,8,NRSV,it is not everyone however who has this knowledge since some have become so accustomed to idols until now they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
6610,1CO,8,NRSV,food will not bring us close to god
6611,1CO,8,NRSV,we are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do
6612,1CO,8,NRSV,but take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak
6613,1CO,8,NRSV,for if others see you who possess knowledge eating in the temple of an idol might they not since their conscience is weak be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols
6614,1CO,8,NRSV,so by your knowledge those weak believers for whom christ died are destroyed
6615,1CO,8,NRSV,but when you thus sin against members of your family
6616,1CO,8,NRSV,and wound their conscience when it is weak you sin against christ
6617,1CO,8,NRSV,therefore if food is a cause of their falling
6618,1CO,8,NRSV,i will never eat meat so that i may not cause one of them
6619,1CO,8,NRSV,to fall
6620,1CO,9,NRSV,am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are you not my work in the lord
6621,1CO,9,NRSV,if i am not an apostle to others at least i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord
6622,1CO,9,NRSV,this is my defense to those who would examine me
6623,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to our food and drink
6624,1CO,9,NRSV,do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife
6625,1CO,9,NRSV,as do the other apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas
6626,1CO,9,NRSV,or is it only barnabas and i who have no right to refrain from working for a living
6627,1CO,9,NRSV,who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk
6628,1CO,9,NRSV,do i say this on human authority does not the law also say the same
6629,1CO,9,NRSV,for it is written in the law of moses you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain is it for oxen that god is concerned
6630,1CO,9,NRSV,or does he not speak entirely for our sake it was indeed written for our sake for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop
6631,1CO,9,NRSV,if we have sown spiritual good among you is it too much if we reap your material benefits
6632,1CO,9,NRSV,if others share this rightful claim on you do not we still more
6633,1CO,9,NRSV,nevertheless we have not made use of this right but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of christ
6634,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar
6635,1CO,9,NRSV,in the same way the lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel
6636,1CO,9,NRSV,but i have made no use of any of these rights nor am i writing this so that they may be applied in my case indeed i would rather die than thatno one will deprive me of my ground for boasting
6637,1CO,9,NRSV,if i proclaim the gospel this gives me no ground for boasting for an obligation is laid on me and woe to me if i do not proclaim the gospel
6638,1CO,9,NRSV,for if i do this of my own will i have a reward but if not of my own will i am entrusted with a commission
6639,1CO,9,NRSV,what then is my reward just this that in my proclamation i may make the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel
6640,1CO,9,NRSV,for though i am free with respect to all i have made myself a slave to all so that i might win more of them
6641,1CO,9,NRSV,to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews to those under the law i became as one under the law though i myself am not under the law so that i might win those under the law
6642,1CO,9,NRSV,to those outside the law i became as one outside the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so that i might win those outside the law
6643,1CO,9,NRSV,to the weak i became weak so that i might win the weak i have become all things to all people that i might by all means save some
6644,1CO,9,NRSV,i do it all for the sake of the gospel so that i may share in its blessings
6645,1CO,9,NRSV,do you not know that in a race the runners all compete but only one receives the prize run in such a way that you may win it
6646,1CO,9,NRSV,athletes exercise selfcontrol in all things they do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an imperishable one
6647,1CO,9,NRSV,so i do not run aimlessly nor do i box as though beating the air
6648,1CO,9,NRSV,but i punish my body and enslave it so that after proclaiming to others i myself should not be disqualified
6649,1CO,10,NRSV,i do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters
6650,1CO,10,NRSV,that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
6651,1CO,10,NRSV,and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea
6652,1CO,10,NRSV,and all ate the same spiritual food
6653,1CO,10,NRSV,and all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ
6654,1CO,10,NRSV,nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them and they were struck down in the wilderness
6655,1CO,10,NRSV,now these things occurred as examples for us so that we might not desire evil as they did
6656,1CO,10,NRSV,do not become idolaters as some of them did as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play
6657,1CO,10,NRSV,we must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did and twentythree thousand fell in a single day
6658,1CO,10,NRSV,we must not put christ
6659,1CO,10,NRSV,to the test as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents
6660,1CO,10,NRSV,and do not complain as some of them did and were destroyed by the destroyer
6661,1CO,10,NRSV,these things happened to them to serve as an example and they were written down to instruct us on whom the ends of the ages have come
6662,1CO,10,NRSV,so if you think you are standing watch out that you do not fall
6663,1CO,10,NRSV,no testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone god is faithful and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it
6664,1CO,10,NRSV,therefore my dear friends
6665,1CO,10,NRSV,flee from the worship of idols
6666,1CO,10,NRSV,i speak as to sensible people judge for yourselves what i say
6667,1CO,10,NRSV,the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a sharing in the blood of christ the bread that we break is it not a sharing in the body of christ
6668,1CO,10,NRSV,because there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread
6669,1CO,10,NRSV,consider the people of israel
6670,1CO,10,NRSV,are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar
6671,1CO,10,NRSV,what do i imply then that food sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything
6672,1CO,10,NRSV,no i imply that what pagans sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to god i do not want you to be partners with demons
6673,1CO,10,NRSV,you cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons you cannot partake of the table of the lord and the table of demons
6674,1CO,10,NRSV,or are we provoking the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he
6675,1CO,10,NRSV,all things are lawful but not all things are beneficial all things are lawful but not all things build up
6676,1CO,10,NRSV,do not seek your own advantage but that of the other
6677,1CO,10,NRSV,eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience
6678,1CO,10,NRSV,for the earth and its fullness are the lords
6679,1CO,10,NRSV,if an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience
6680,1CO,10,NRSV,but if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it out of consideration for the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience
6681,1CO,10,NRSV,i mean the others conscience not your own for why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone elses conscience
6682,1CO,10,NRSV,if i partake with thankfulness why should i be denounced because of that for which i give thanks
6683,1CO,10,NRSV,so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do everything for the glory of god
6684,1CO,10,NRSV,give no offense to jews or to greeks or to the church of god
6685,1CO,10,NRSV,just as i try to please everyone in everything i do not seeking my own advantage but that of many so that they may be saved
6686,1CO,11,NRSV,be imitators of me as i am of christ
6687,1CO,11,NRSV,i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you
6688,1CO,11,NRSV,but i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man and the husband
6689,1CO,11,NRSV,is the head of his wife
6690,1CO,11,NRSV,and god is the head of christ
6691,1CO,11,NRSV,any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head disgraces his head
6692,1CO,11,NRSV,but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved
6693,1CO,11,NRSV,for if a woman will not veil herself then she should cut off her hair but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved she should wear a veil
6694,1CO,11,NRSV,for a man ought not to have his head veiled since he is the image and reflection
6695,1CO,11,NRSV,of god but woman is the reflection
6696,1CO,11,NRSV,of man
6697,1CO,11,NRSV,indeed man was not made from woman but woman from man
6698,1CO,11,NRSV,neither was man created for the sake of woman but woman for the sake of man
6699,1CO,11,NRSV,for this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of
6700,1CO,11,NRSV,authority on her head
6701,1CO,11,NRSV,because of the angels
6702,1CO,11,NRSV,nevertheless in the lord woman is not independent of man or man independent of woman
6703,1CO,11,NRSV,for just as woman came from man so man comes through woman but all things come from god
6704,1CO,11,NRSV,judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray to god with her head unveiled
6705,1CO,11,NRSV,does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is degrading to him
6706,1CO,11,NRSV,but if a woman has long hair it is her glory for her hair is given to her for a covering
6707,1CO,11,NRSV,but if anyone is disposed to be contentiouswe have no such custom nor do the churches of god
6708,1CO,11,NRSV,now in the following instructions i do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
6709,1CO,11,NRSV,for to begin with when you come together as a church i hear that there are divisions among you and to some extent i believe it
6710,1CO,11,NRSV,indeed there have to be factions among you for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine
6711,1CO,11,NRSV,when you come together it is not really to eat the lords supper
6712,1CO,11,NRSV,for when the time comes to eat each of you goes ahead with your own supper and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk
6713,1CO,11,NRSV,what do you not have homes to eat and drink in or do you show contempt for the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing what should i say to you should i commend you in this matter i do not commend you
6714,1CO,11,NRSV,for i received from the lord what i also handed on to you that the lord jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread
6715,1CO,11,NRSV,and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body that is for
6716,1CO,11,NRSV,you do this in remembrance of me
6717,1CO,11,NRSV,in the same way he took the cup also after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
6718,1CO,11,NRSV,for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes
6719,1CO,11,NRSV,whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the lord
6720,1CO,11,NRSV,examine yourselves and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup
6721,1CO,11,NRSV,for all who eat and drink
6722,1CO,11,NRSV,without discerning the body
6723,1CO,11,NRSV,eat and drink judgment against themselves
6724,1CO,11,NRSV,for this reason many of you are weak and ill and some have died
6725,1CO,11,NRSV,but if we judged ourselves we would not be judged
6726,1CO,11,NRSV,but when we are judged by the lord we are disciplined
6727,1CO,11,NRSV,so that we may not be condemned along with the world
6728,1CO,11,NRSV,so then my brothers and sisters
6729,1CO,11,NRSV,when you come together to eat wait for one another
6730,1CO,11,NRSV,if you are hungry eat at home so that when you come together it will not be for your condemnation about the other things i will give instructions when i come
6731,1CO,12,NRSV,now concerning spiritual gifts
6732,1CO,12,NRSV,brothers and sisters
6733,1CO,12,NRSV,i do not want you to be uninformed
6734,1CO,12,NRSV,you know that when you were pagans you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak
6735,1CO,12,NRSV,therefore i want you to understand that no one speaking by the spirit of god ever says let jesus be cursed and no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit
6736,1CO,12,NRSV,now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit
6737,1CO,12,NRSV,and there are varieties of services but the same lord
6738,1CO,12,NRSV,and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone
6739,1CO,12,NRSV,to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
6740,1CO,12,NRSV,to one is given through the spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit
6741,1CO,12,NRSV,to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the one spirit
6742,1CO,12,NRSV,to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another the discernment of spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues
6743,1CO,12,NRSV,all these are activated by one and the same spirit who allots to each one individually just as the spirit chooses
6744,1CO,12,NRSV,for just as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body though many are one body so it is with christ
6745,1CO,12,NRSV,for in the one spirit we were all baptized into one bodyjews or greeks slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one spirit
6746,1CO,12,NRSV,indeed the body does not consist of one member but of many
6747,1CO,12,NRSV,if the foot would say because i am not a hand i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body
6748,1CO,12,NRSV,and if the ear would say because i am not an eye i do not belong to the body that would not make it any less a part of the body
6749,1CO,12,NRSV,if the whole body were an eye where would the hearing be if the whole body were hearing where would the sense of smell be
6750,1CO,12,NRSV,but as it is god arranged the members in the body each one of them as he chose
6751,1CO,12,NRSV,if all were a single member where would the body be
6752,1CO,12,NRSV,as it is there are many members yet one body
6753,1CO,12,NRSV,the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of you nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you
6754,1CO,12,NRSV,on the contrary the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable
6755,1CO,12,NRSV,and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect
6756,1CO,12,NRSV,whereas our more respectable members do not need this but god has so arranged the body giving the greater honor to the inferior member
6757,1CO,12,NRSV,that there may be no dissension within the body but the members may have the same care for one another
6758,1CO,12,NRSV,if one member suffers all suffer together with it if one member is honored all rejoice together with it
6759,1CO,12,NRSV,now you are the body of christ and individually members of it
6760,1CO,12,NRSV,and god has appointed in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then deeds of power then gifts of healing forms of assistance forms of leadership various kinds of tongues
6761,1CO,12,NRSV,are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers do all work miracles
6762,1CO,12,NRSV,do all possess gifts of healing do all speak in tongues do all interpret
6763,1CO,12,NRSV,but strive for the greater gifts and i will show you a still more excellent way
6764,1CO,13,NRSV,if i speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels but do not have love i am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal
6765,1CO,13,NRSV,and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love i am nothing
6766,1CO,13,NRSV,if i give away all my possessions and if i hand over my body so that i may boast
6767,1CO,13,NRSV,but do not have love i gain nothing
6768,1CO,13,NRSV,love is patient love is kind love is not envious or boastful or arrogant
6769,1CO,13,NRSV,or rude it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful
6770,1CO,13,NRSV,it does not rejoice in wrongdoing but rejoices in the truth
6771,1CO,13,NRSV,it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
6772,1CO,13,NRSV,love never ends but as for prophecies they will come to an end as for tongues they will cease as for knowledge it will come to an end
6773,1CO,13,NRSV,for we know only in part and we prophesy only in part
6774,1CO,13,NRSV,but when the complete comes the partial will come to an end
6775,1CO,13,NRSV,when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put an end to childish ways
6776,1CO,13,NRSV,for now we see in a mirror dimly
6777,1CO,13,NRSV,but then we will see face to face now i know only in part then i will know fully even as i have been fully known
6778,1CO,13,NRSV,and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love
6779,1CO,14,NRSV,pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts and especially that you may prophesy
6780,1CO,14,NRSV,for those who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to god for nobody understands them since they are speaking mysteries in the spirit
6781,1CO,14,NRSV,on the other hand those who prophesy speak to other people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation
6782,1CO,14,NRSV,those who speak in a tongue build up themselves but those who prophesy build up the church
6783,1CO,14,NRSV,now i would like all of you to speak in tongues but even more to prophesy one who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may be built up
6784,1CO,14,NRSV,now brothers and sisters
6785,1CO,14,NRSV,if i come to you speaking in tongues how will i benefit you unless i speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching
6786,1CO,14,NRSV,it is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound such as the flute or the harp if they do not give distinct notes how will anyone know what is being played
6787,1CO,14,NRSV,and if the bugle gives an indistinct sound who will get ready for battle
6788,1CO,14,NRSV,so with yourselves if in a tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible how will anyone know what is being said for you will be speaking into the air
6789,1CO,14,NRSV,there are doubtless many different kinds of sounds in the world and nothing is without sound
6790,1CO,14,NRSV,if then i do not know the meaning of a sound i will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me
6791,1CO,14,NRSV,so with yourselves since you are eager for spiritual gifts strive to excel in them for building up the church
6792,1CO,14,NRSV,therefore one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret
6793,1CO,14,NRSV,for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive
6794,1CO,14,NRSV,what should i do then i will pray with the spirit but i will pray with the mind also i will sing praise with the spirit but i will sing praise with the mind also
6795,1CO,14,NRSV,otherwise if you say a blessing with the spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the amen to your thanksgiving since the outsider does not know what you are saying
6796,1CO,14,NRSV,for you may give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up
6797,1CO,14,NRSV,i thank god that i speak in tongues more than all of you
6798,1CO,14,NRSV,nevertheless in church i would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others also than ten thousand words in a tongue
6799,1CO,14,NRSV,brothers and sisters
6800,1CO,14,NRSV,do not be children in your thinking rather be infants in evil but in thinking be adults
6801,1CO,14,NRSV,in the law it is written
6802,1CO,14,NRSV,by people of strange tongues
6803,1CO,14,NRSV,and by the lips of foreigners
6804,1CO,14,NRSV,i will speak to this people
6805,1CO,14,NRSV,yet even then they will not listen to me
6806,1CO,14,NRSV,says the lord
6807,1CO,14,NRSV,tongues then are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers
6808,1CO,14,NRSV,if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders or unbelievers enter will they not say that you are out of your mind
6809,1CO,14,NRSV,but if all prophesy an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all
6810,1CO,14,NRSV,after the secrets of the unbelievers heart are disclosed that person will bow down before god and worship him declaring god is really among you
6811,1CO,14,NRSV,what should be done then my friends
6812,1CO,14,NRSV,when you come together each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation let all things be done for building up
6813,1CO,14,NRSV,if anyone speaks in a tongue let there be only two or at most three and each in turn and let one interpret
6814,1CO,14,NRSV,but if there is no one to interpret let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to god
6815,1CO,14,NRSV,let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said
6816,1CO,14,NRSV,if a revelation is made to someone else sitting nearby let the first person be silent
6817,1CO,14,NRSV,for you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged
6818,1CO,14,NRSV,and the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets
6819,1CO,14,NRSV,for god is a god not of disorder but of peace
6820,1CO,14,NRSV,as in all the churches of the saints
6821,1CO,14,NRSV,women should be silent in the churches for they are not permitted to speak but should be subordinate as the law also says
6822,1CO,14,NRSV,if there is anything they desire to know let them ask their husbands at home for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church
6823,1CO,14,NRSV,or did the word of god originate with you or are you the only ones it has reached
6824,1CO,14,NRSV,anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must acknowledge that what i am writing to you is a command of the lord
6825,1CO,14,NRSV,anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized
6826,1CO,14,NRSV,so my friends
6827,1CO,14,NRSV,be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues
6828,1CO,14,NRSV,but all things should be done decently and in order
6829,1CO,15,NRSV,now i would remind you brothers and sisters
6830,1CO,15,NRSV,of the good news
6831,1CO,15,NRSV,that i proclaimed to you which you in turn received in which also you stand
6832,1CO,15,NRSV,through which also you are being saved if you hold firmly to the message that i proclaimed to youunless you have come to believe in vain
6833,1CO,15,NRSV,for i handed on to you as of first importance what i in turn had received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures
6834,1CO,15,NRSV,and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures
6835,1CO,15,NRSV,and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve
6836,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters
6837,1CO,15,NRSV,at one time most of whom are still alive though some have died
6838,1CO,15,NRSV,then he appeared to james then to all the apostles
6839,1CO,15,NRSV,last of all as to one untimely born he appeared also to me
6840,1CO,15,NRSV,for i am the least of the apostles unfit to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god
6841,1CO,15,NRSV,but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me has not been in vain on the contrary i worked harder than any of themthough it was not i but the grace of god that is with me
6842,1CO,15,NRSV,whether then it was i or they so we proclaim and so you have come to believe
6843,1CO,15,NRSV,now if christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead
6844,1CO,15,NRSV,if there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised
6845,1CO,15,NRSV,and if christ has not been raised then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain
6846,1CO,15,NRSV,we are even found to be misrepresenting god because we testified of god that he raised christwhom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised
6847,1CO,15,NRSV,for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised
6848,1CO,15,NRSV,if christ has not been raised your faith is futile and you are still in your sins
6849,1CO,15,NRSV,then those also who have died
6850,1CO,15,NRSV,in christ have perished
6851,1CO,15,NRSV,if for this life only we have hoped in christ we are of all people most to be pitied
6852,1CO,15,NRSV,but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have died
6853,1CO,15,NRSV,for since death came through a human being the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being
6854,1CO,15,NRSV,for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ
6855,1CO,15,NRSV,but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at his coming those who belong to christ
6856,1CO,15,NRSV,then comes the end
6857,1CO,15,NRSV,when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power
6858,1CO,15,NRSV,for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet
6859,1CO,15,NRSV,the last enemy to be destroyed is death
6860,1CO,15,NRSV,for god
6861,1CO,15,NRSV,has put all things in subjection under his feet but when it says all things are put in subjection it is plain that this does not include the one who put all things in subjection under him
6862,1CO,15,NRSV,when all things are subjected to him then the son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him so that god may be all in all
6863,1CO,15,NRSV,otherwise what will those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the dead if the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized on their behalf
6864,1CO,15,NRSV,and why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour
6865,1CO,15,NRSV,i die every day that is as certain brothers and sisters
6866,1CO,15,NRSV,as my boasting of youa boast that i make in christ jesus our lord
6867,1CO,15,NRSV,if with merely human hopes i fought with wild animals at ephesus what would i have gained by it if the dead are not raised
6868,1CO,15,NRSV,let us eat and drink
6869,1CO,15,NRSV,for tomorrow we die
6870,1CO,15,NRSV,do not be deceived
6871,1CO,15,NRSV,bad company ruins good morals
6872,1CO,15,NRSV,come to a sober and right mind and sin no more for some people have no knowledge of god i say this to your shame
6873,1CO,15,NRSV,but someone will ask how are the dead raised with what kind of body do they come
6874,1CO,15,NRSV,fool what you sow does not come to life unless it dies
6875,1CO,15,NRSV,and as for what you sow you do not sow the body that is to be but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain
6876,1CO,15,NRSV,but god gives it a body as he has chosen and to each kind of seed its own body
6877,1CO,15,NRSV,not all flesh is alike but there is one flesh for human beings another for animals another for birds and another for fish
6878,1CO,15,NRSV,there are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one thing and that of the earthly is another
6879,1CO,15,NRSV,there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars indeed star differs from star in glory
6880,1CO,15,NRSV,so it is with the resurrection of the dead what is sown is perishable what is raised is imperishable
6881,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power
6882,1CO,15,NRSV,it is sown a physical body it is raised a spiritual body if there is a physical body there is also a spiritual body
6883,1CO,15,NRSV,thus it is written the first man adam became a living being the last adam became a lifegiving spirit
6884,1CO,15,NRSV,but it is not the spiritual that is first but the physical and then the spiritual
6885,1CO,15,NRSV,the first man was from the earth a man of dust the second man is
6886,1CO,15,NRSV,from heaven
6887,1CO,15,NRSV,as was the man of dust so are those who are of the dust and as is the man of heaven so are those who are of heaven
6888,1CO,15,NRSV,just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will
6889,1CO,15,NRSV,also bear the image of the man of heaven
6890,1CO,15,NRSV,what i am saying brothers and sisters
6891,1CO,15,NRSV,is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable
6892,1CO,15,NRSV,listen i will tell you a mystery we will not all die
6893,1CO,15,NRSV,but we will all be changed
6894,1CO,15,NRSV,in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed
6895,1CO,15,NRSV,for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality
6896,1CO,15,NRSV,when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled
6897,1CO,15,NRSV,death has been swallowed up in victory
6898,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your victory
6899,1CO,15,NRSV,where o death is your sting
6900,1CO,15,NRSV,the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
6901,1CO,15,NRSV,but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ
6902,1CO,15,NRSV,therefore my beloved
6903,1CO,15,NRSV,be steadfast immovable always excelling in the work of the lord because you know that in the lord your labor is not in vain
6904,1CO,16,NRSV,now concerning the collection for the saints you should follow the directions i gave to the churches of galatia
6905,1CO,16,NRSV,on the first day of every week each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn so that collections need not be taken when i come
6906,1CO,16,NRSV,and when i arrive i will send any whom you approve with letters to take your gift to jerusalem
6907,1CO,16,NRSV,if it seems advisable that i should go also they will accompany me
6908,1CO,16,NRSV,i will visit you after passing through macedoniafor i intend to pass through macedonia
6909,1CO,16,NRSV,and perhaps i will stay with you or even spend the winter so that you may send me on my way wherever i go
6910,1CO,16,NRSV,i do not want to see you now just in passing for i hope to spend some time with you if the lord permits
6911,1CO,16,NRSV,but i will stay in ephesus until pentecost
6912,1CO,16,NRSV,for a wide door for effective work has opened to me and there are many adversaries
6913,1CO,16,NRSV,if timothy comes see that he has nothing to fear among you for he is doing the work of the lord just as i am
6914,1CO,16,NRSV,therefore let no one despise him send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am expecting him with the brothers
6915,1CO,16,NRSV,now concerning our brother apollos i strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers but he was not at all willing
6916,1CO,16,NRSV,to come now he will come when he has the opportunity
6917,1CO,16,NRSV,keep alert stand firm in your faith be courageous be strong
6918,1CO,16,NRSV,let all that you do be done in love
6919,1CO,16,NRSV,now brothers and sisters
6920,1CO,16,NRSV,you know that members of the household of stephanas were the first converts in achaia and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints
6921,1CO,16,NRSV,i urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people and of everyone who works and toils with them
6922,1CO,16,NRSV,i rejoice at the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus because they have made up for your absence
6923,1CO,16,NRSV,for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours so give recognition to such persons
6924,1CO,16,NRSV,the churches of asia send greetings aquila and prisca together with the church in their house greet you warmly in the lord
6925,1CO,16,NRSV,all the brothers and sisters
6926,1CO,16,NRSV,send greetings greet one another with a holy kiss
6927,1CO,16,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand
6928,1CO,16,NRSV,let anyone be accursed who has no love for the lord our lord come
6929,1CO,16,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus be with you
6930,1CO,16,NRSV,my love be with all of you in christ jesus
6931,2CO,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother
6932,2CO,1,NRSV,to the church of god that is in corinth including all the saints throughout achaia
6933,2CO,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
6934,2CO,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all consolation
6935,2CO,1,NRSV,who consoles us in all our affliction so that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction with the consolation with which we ourselves are consoled by god
6936,2CO,1,NRSV,for just as the sufferings of christ are abundant for us so also our consolation is abundant through christ
6937,2CO,1,NRSV,if we are being afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation if we are being consoled it is for your consolation which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering
6938,2CO,1,NRSV,our hope for you is unshaken for we know that as you share in our sufferings so also you share in our consolation
6939,2CO,1,NRSV,we do not want you to be unaware brothers and sisters
6940,2CO,1,NRSV,of the affliction we experienced in asia for we were so utterly unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself
6941,2CO,1,NRSV,indeed we felt that we had received the sentence of death so that we would rely not on ourselves but on god who raises the dead
6942,2CO,1,NRSV,he who rescued us from so deadly a peril will continue to rescue us on him we have set our hope that he will rescue us again
6943,2CO,1,NRSV,as you also join in helping us by your prayers so that many will give thanks on our
6944,2CO,1,NRSV,behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many
6945,2CO,1,NRSV,indeed this is our boast the testimony of our conscience we have behaved in the world with frankness
6946,2CO,1,NRSV,and godly sincerity not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of godand all the more toward you
6947,2CO,1,NRSV,for we write you nothing other than what you can read and also understand i hope you will understand until the end
6948,2CO,1,NRSV,as you have already understood us in partthat on the day of the lord jesus we are your boast even as you are our boast
6949,2CO,1,NRSV,since i was sure of this i wanted to come to you first so that you might have a double favor
6950,2CO,1,NRSV,i wanted to visit you on my way to macedonia and to come back to you from macedonia and have you send me on to judea
6951,2CO,1,NRSV,was i vacillating when i wanted to do this do i make my plans according to ordinary human standards
6952,2CO,1,NRSV,ready to say yes yes and no no at the same time
6953,2CO,1,NRSV,as surely as god is faithful our word to you has not been yes and no
6954,2CO,1,NRSV,for the son of god jesus christ whom we proclaimed among you silvanus and timothy and i was not yes and no but in him it is always yes
6955,2CO,1,NRSV,for in him every one of gods promises is a yes for this reason it is through him that we say the amen to the glory of god
6956,2CO,1,NRSV,but it is god who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us
6957,2CO,1,NRSV,by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts as a first installment
6958,2CO,1,NRSV,but i call on god as witness against me it was to spare you that i did not come again to corinth
6959,2CO,1,NRSV,i do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith rather we are workers with you for your joy because you stand firm in the faith
6960,2CO,2,NRSV,so i made up my mind not to make you another painful visit
6961,2CO,2,NRSV,for if i cause you pain who is there to make me glad but the one whom i have pained
6962,2CO,2,NRSV,and i wrote as i did so that when i came i might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice for i am confident about all of you that my joy would be the joy of all of you
6963,2CO,2,NRSV,for i wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that i have for you
6964,2CO,2,NRSV,but if anyone has caused pain he has caused it not to me but to some extentnot to exaggerate itto all of you
6965,2CO,2,NRSV,this punishment by the majority is enough for such a person
6966,2CO,2,NRSV,so now instead you should forgive and console him so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow
6967,2CO,2,NRSV,so i urge you to reaffirm your love for him
6968,2CO,2,NRSV,i wrote for this reason to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything
6969,2CO,2,NRSV,anyone whom you forgive i also forgive what i have forgiven if i have forgiven anything has been for your sake in the presence of christ
6970,2CO,2,NRSV,and we do this so that we may not be outwitted by satan for we are not ignorant of his designs
6971,2CO,2,NRSV,when i came to troas to proclaim the good news of christ a door was opened for me in the lord
6972,2CO,2,NRSV,but my mind could not rest because i did not find my brother titus there so i said farewell to them and went on to macedonia
6973,2CO,2,NRSV,but thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him
6974,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are the aroma of christ to god among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing
6975,2CO,2,NRSV,to the one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to life who is sufficient for these things
6976,2CO,2,NRSV,for we are not peddlers of gods word like so many
6977,2CO,2,NRSV,but in christ we speak as persons of sincerity as persons sent from god and standing in his presence
6978,2CO,3,NRSV,are we beginning to commend ourselves again surely we do not need as some do letters of recommendation to you or from you do we
6979,2CO,3,NRSV,you yourselves are our letter written on our
6980,2CO,3,NRSV,hearts to be known and read by all
6981,2CO,3,NRSV,and you show that you are a letter of christ prepared by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts
6982,2CO,3,NRSV,such is the confidence that we have through christ toward god
6983,2CO,3,NRSV,not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us our competence is from god
6984,2CO,3,NRSV,who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not of letter but of spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life
6985,2CO,3,NRSV,now if the ministry of death chiseled in letters on stone tablets
6986,2CO,3,NRSV,came in glory so that the people of israel could not gaze at moses face because of the glory of his face a glory now set aside
6987,2CO,3,NRSV,how much more will the ministry of the spirit come in glory
6988,2CO,3,NRSV,for if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory
6989,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory
6990,2CO,3,NRSV,for if what was set aside came through glory much more has the permanent come in glory
6991,2CO,3,NRSV,since then we have such a hope we act with great boldness
6992,2CO,3,NRSV,not like moses who put a veil over his face to keep the people of israel from gazing at the end of the glory that
6993,2CO,3,NRSV,was being set aside
6994,2CO,3,NRSV,but their minds were hardened indeed to this very day when they hear the reading of the old covenant that same veil is still there since only in christ is it set aside
6995,2CO,3,NRSV,indeed to this very day whenever moses is read a veil lies over their minds
6996,2CO,3,NRSV,but when one turns to the lord the veil is removed
6997,2CO,3,NRSV,now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom
6998,2CO,3,NRSV,and all of us with unveiled faces seeing the glory of the lord as though reflected in a mirror are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord the spirit
6999,2CO,4,NRSV,therefore since it is by gods mercy that we are engaged in this ministry we do not lose heart
7000,2CO,4,NRSV,we have renounced the shameful things that one hides we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify gods word but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of god
7001,2CO,4,NRSV,and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing
7002,2CO,4,NRSV,in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
7003,2CO,4,NRSV,for we do not proclaim ourselves we proclaim jesus christ as lord and ourselves as your slaves for jesus sake
7004,2CO,4,NRSV,for it is the god who said let light shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
7005,2CO,4,NRSV,but we have this treasure in clay jars so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to god and does not come from us
7006,2CO,4,NRSV,we are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not driven to despair
7007,2CO,4,NRSV,persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed
7008,2CO,4,NRSV,always carrying in the body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be made visible in our bodies
7009,2CO,4,NRSV,for while we live we are always being given up to death for jesus sake so that the life of jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh
7010,2CO,4,NRSV,so death is at work in us but life in you
7011,2CO,4,NRSV,but just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripturei believed and so i spokewe also believe and so we speak
7012,2CO,4,NRSV,because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus will raise us also with jesus and will bring us with you into his presence
7013,2CO,4,NRSV,yes everything is for your sake so that grace as it extends to more and more people may increase thanksgiving to the glory of god
7014,2CO,4,NRSV,so we do not lose heart even though our outer nature is wasting away our inner nature is being renewed day by day
7015,2CO,4,NRSV,for this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure
7016,2CO,4,NRSV,because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal
7017,2CO,5,NRSV,for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
7018,2CO,5,NRSV,for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling
7019,2CO,5,NRSV,if indeed when we have taken it off
7020,2CO,5,NRSV,we will not be found naked
7021,2CO,5,NRSV,for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
7022,2CO,5,NRSV,he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a guarantee
7023,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are always confident even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord
7024,2CO,5,NRSV,for we walk by faith not by sight
7025,2CO,5,NRSV,yes we do have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord
7026,2CO,5,NRSV,so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him
7027,2CO,5,NRSV,for all of us must appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body whether good or evil
7028,2CO,5,NRSV,therefore knowing the fear of the lord we try to persuade others but we ourselves are well known to god and i hope that we are also well known to your consciences
7029,2CO,5,NRSV,we are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart
7030,2CO,5,NRSV,for if we are beside ourselves it is for god if we are in our right mind it is for you
7031,2CO,5,NRSV,for the love of christ urges us on because we are convinced that one has died for all therefore all have died
7032,2CO,5,NRSV,and he died for all so that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised for them
7033,2CO,5,NRSV,from now on therefore we regard no one from a human point of view
7034,2CO,5,NRSV,even though we once knew christ from a human point of view
7035,2CO,5,NRSV,we know him no longer in that way
7036,2CO,5,NRSV,so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new
7037,2CO,5,NRSV,all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation
7038,2CO,5,NRSV,that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself
7039,2CO,5,NRSV,not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us
7040,2CO,5,NRSV,so we are ambassadors for christ since god is making his appeal through us we entreat you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god
7041,2CO,5,NRSV,for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
7042,2CO,6,NRSV,as we work together with him
7043,2CO,6,NRSV,we urge you also not to accept the grace of god in vain
7044,2CO,6,NRSV,for he says
7045,2CO,6,NRSV,at an acceptable time i have listened to you
7046,2CO,6,NRSV,and on a day of salvation i have helped you
7047,2CO,6,NRSV,see now is the acceptable time see now is the day of salvation
7048,2CO,6,NRSV,we are putting no obstacle in anyones way so that no fault may be found with our ministry
7049,2CO,6,NRSV,but as servants of god we have commended ourselves in every way through great endurance in afflictions hardships calamities
7050,2CO,6,NRSV,beatings imprisonments riots labors sleepless nights hunger
7051,2CO,6,NRSV,by purity knowledge patience kindness holiness of spirit genuine love
7052,2CO,6,NRSV,truthful speech and the power of god with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left
7053,2CO,6,NRSV,in honor and dishonor in ill repute and good repute we are treated as impostors and yet are true
7054,2CO,6,NRSV,as unknown and yet are well known as dying and seewe are alive as punished and yet not killed
7055,2CO,6,NRSV,as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing everything
7056,2CO,6,NRSV,we have spoken frankly to you corinthians our heart is wide open to you
7057,2CO,6,NRSV,there is no restriction in our affections but only in yours
7058,2CO,6,NRSV,in returni speak as to childrenopen wide your hearts also
7059,2CO,6,NRSV,do not be mismatched with unbelievers for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness or what fellowship is there between light and darkness
7060,2CO,6,NRSV,what agreement does christ have with beliar or what does a believer share with an unbeliever
7061,2CO,6,NRSV,what agreement has the temple of god with idols for we
7062,2CO,6,NRSV,are the temple of the living god as god said
7063,2CO,6,NRSV,i will live in them and walk among them
7064,2CO,6,NRSV,and i will be their god
7065,2CO,6,NRSV,and they shall be my people
7066,2CO,6,NRSV,therefore come out from them
7067,2CO,6,NRSV,and be separate from them says the lord
7068,2CO,6,NRSV,and touch nothing unclean
7069,2CO,6,NRSV,then i will welcome you
7070,2CO,6,NRSV,and i will be your father
7071,2CO,6,NRSV,and you shall be my sons and daughters
7072,2CO,6,NRSV,says the lord almighty
7073,2CO,7,NRSV,since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and of spirit making holiness perfect in the fear of god
7074,2CO,7,NRSV,make room in your hearts
7075,2CO,7,NRSV,for us we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one
7076,2CO,7,NRSV,i do not say this to condemn you for i said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together
7077,2CO,7,NRSV,i often boast about you i have great pride in you i am filled with consolation i am overjoyed in all our affliction
7078,2CO,7,NRSV,for even when we came into macedonia our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted in every waydisputes without and fears within
7079,2CO,7,NRSV,but god who consoles the downcast consoled us by the arrival of titus
7080,2CO,7,NRSV,and not only by his coming but also by the consolation with which he was consoled about you as he told us of your longing your mourning your zeal for me so that i rejoiced still more
7081,2CO,7,NRSV,for even if i made you sorry with my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it for i see that i grieved you with that letter though only briefly
7082,2CO,7,NRSV,now i rejoice not because you were grieved but because your grief led to repentance for you felt a godly grief so that you were not harmed in any way by us
7083,2CO,7,NRSV,for godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret but worldly grief produces death
7084,2CO,7,NRSV,for see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what zeal what punishment at every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter
7085,2CO,7,NRSV,so although i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the one who was wronged but in order that your zeal for us might be made known to you before god
7086,2CO,7,NRSV,in this we find comfort
7087,2CO,7,NRSV,in addition to our own consolation we rejoiced still more at the joy of titus because his mind has been set at rest by all of you
7088,2CO,7,NRSV,for if i have been somewhat boastful about you to him i was not disgraced but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting to titus has proved true as well
7089,2CO,7,NRSV,and his heart goes out all the more to you as he remembers the obedience of all of you and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling
7090,2CO,7,NRSV,i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you
7091,2CO,8,NRSV,we want you to know brothers and sisters
7092,2CO,8,NRSV,about the grace of god that has been granted to the churches of macedonia
7093,2CO,8,NRSV,for during a severe ordeal of affliction their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part
7094,2CO,8,NRSV,for as i can testify they voluntarily gave according to their means and even beyond their means
7095,2CO,8,NRSV,begging us earnestly for the privilege
7096,2CO,8,NRSV,of sharing in this ministry to the saints
7097,2CO,8,NRSV,and this not merely as we expected they gave themselves first to the lord and by the will of god to us
7098,2CO,8,NRSV,so that we might urge titus that as he had already made a beginning so he should also complete this generous undertaking
7099,2CO,8,NRSV,among you
7100,2CO,8,NRSV,now as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in utmost eagerness and in our love for you
7101,2CO,8,NRSV,so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking
7102,2CO,8,NRSV,i do not say this as a command but i am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others
7103,2CO,8,NRSV,for you know the generous act
7104,2CO,8,NRSV,of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that by his poverty you might become rich
7105,2CO,8,NRSV,and in this matter i am giving my advice it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something
7106,2CO,8,NRSV,now finish doing it so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means
7107,2CO,8,NRSV,for if the eagerness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one hasnot according to what one does not have
7108,2CO,8,NRSV,i do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you but it is a question of a fair balance between
7109,2CO,8,NRSV,your present abundance and their need so that their abundance may be for your need in order that there may be a fair balance
7110,2CO,8,NRSV,as it is written
7111,2CO,8,NRSV,the one who had much did not have too much
7112,2CO,8,NRSV,and the one who had little did not have too little
7113,2CO,8,NRSV,but thanks be to god who put in the heart of titus the same eagerness for you that i myself have
7114,2CO,8,NRSV,for he not only accepted our appeal but since he is more eager than ever he is going to you of his own accord
7115,2CO,8,NRSV,with him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his proclaiming the good news
7116,2CO,8,NRSV,and not only that but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this generous undertaking
7117,2CO,8,NRSV,for the glory of the lord himself
7118,2CO,8,NRSV,and to show our goodwill
7119,2CO,8,NRSV,we intend that no one should blame us about this generous gift that we are administering
7120,2CO,8,NRSV,for we intend to do what is right not only in the lords sight but also in the sight of others
7121,2CO,8,NRSV,and with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found eager in many matters but who is now more eager than ever because of his great confidence in you
7122,2CO,8,NRSV,as for titus he is my partner and coworker in your service as for our brothers they are messengers
7123,2CO,8,NRSV,of the churches the glory of christ
7124,2CO,8,NRSV,therefore openly before the churches show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you
7125,2CO,9,NRSV,now it is not necessary for me to write you about the ministry to the saints
7126,2CO,9,NRSV,for i know your eagerness which is the subject of my boasting about you to the people of macedonia saying that achaia has been ready since last year and your zeal has stirred up most of them
7127,2CO,9,NRSV,but i am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you may not prove to have been empty in this case so that you may be ready as i said you would be
7128,2CO,9,NRSV,otherwise if some macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready we would be humiliatedto say nothing of youin this undertaking
7129,2CO,9,NRSV,so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for this bountiful gift that you have promised so that it may be ready as a voluntary gift and not as an extortion
7130,2CO,9,NRSV,the point is this the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully
7131,2CO,9,NRSV,each of you must give as you have made up your mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
7132,2CO,9,NRSV,and god is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that by always having enough of everything you may share abundantly in every good work
7133,2CO,9,NRSV,as it is written
7134,2CO,9,NRSV,he scatters abroad he gives to the poor
7135,2CO,9,NRSV,his righteousness
7136,2CO,9,NRSV,endures forever
7137,2CO,9,NRSV,he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness
7138,2CO,9,NRSV,you will be enriched in every way for your great generosity which will produce thanksgiving to god through us
7139,2CO,9,NRSV,for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to god
7140,2CO,9,NRSV,through the testing of this ministry you glorify god by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others
7141,2CO,9,NRSV,while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of god that he has given you
7142,2CO,9,NRSV,thanks be to god for his indescribable gift
7143,2CO,10,NRSV,i myself paul appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of christi who am humble when face to face with you but bold toward you when i am away
7144,2CO,10,NRSV,i ask that when i am present i need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards
7145,2CO,10,NRSV,indeed we live as human beings
7146,2CO,10,NRSV,but we do not wage war according to human standards
7147,2CO,10,NRSV,for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human
7148,2CO,10,NRSV,but they have divine power to destroy strongholds we destroy arguments
7149,2CO,10,NRSV,and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of god and we take every thought captive to obey christ
7150,2CO,10,NRSV,we are ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete
7151,2CO,10,NRSV,look at what is before your eyes if you are confident that you belong to christ remind yourself of this that just as you belong to christ so also do we
7152,2CO,10,NRSV,now even if i boast a little too much of our authority which the lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down i will not be ashamed of it
7153,2CO,10,NRSV,i do not want to seem as though i am trying to frighten you with my letters
7154,2CO,10,NRSV,for they say his letters are weighty and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible
7155,2CO,10,NRSV,let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent we will also do when present
7156,2CO,10,NRSV,we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves but when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another they do not show good sense
7157,2CO,10,NRSV,we however will not boast beyond limits but will keep within the field that god has assigned to us to reach out even as far as you
7158,2CO,10,NRSV,for we were not overstepping our limits when we reached you we were the first to come all the way to you with the good news
7159,2CO,10,NRSV,of christ
7160,2CO,10,NRSV,we do not boast beyond limits that is in the labors of others but our hope is that as your faith increases our sphere of action among you may be greatly enlarged
7161,2CO,10,NRSV,so that we may proclaim the good news
7162,2CO,10,NRSV,in lands beyond you without boasting of work already done in someone elses sphere of action
7163,2CO,10,NRSV,let the one who boasts boast in the lord
7164,2CO,10,NRSV,for it is not those who commend themselves that are approved but those whom the lord commends
7165,2CO,11,NRSV,i wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness do bear with me
7166,2CO,11,NRSV,i feel a divine jealousy for you for i promised you in marriage to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to christ
7167,2CO,11,NRSV,but i am afraid that as the serpent deceived eve by its cunning your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure
7168,2CO,11,NRSV,devotion to christ
7169,2CO,11,NRSV,for if someone comes and proclaims another jesus than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you submit to it readily enough
7170,2CO,11,NRSV,i think that i am not in the least inferior to these superapostles
7171,2CO,11,NRSV,i may be untrained in speech but not in knowledge certainly in every way and in all things we have made this evident to you
7172,2CO,11,NRSV,did i commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted because i proclaimed gods good news
7173,2CO,11,NRSV,to you free of charge
7174,2CO,11,NRSV,i robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you
7175,2CO,11,NRSV,and when i was with you and was in need i did not burden anyone for my needs were supplied by the friends
7176,2CO,11,NRSV,who came from macedonia so i refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way
7177,2CO,11,NRSV,as the truth of christ is in me this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of achaia
7178,2CO,11,NRSV,and why because i do not love you god knows i do
7179,2CO,11,NRSV,and what i do i will also continue to do in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about
7180,2CO,11,NRSV,for such boasters are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ
7181,2CO,11,NRSV,and no wonder even satan disguises himself as an angel of light
7182,2CO,11,NRSV,so it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness their end will match their deeds
7183,2CO,11,NRSV,i repeat let no one think that i am a fool but if you do then accept me as a fool so that i too may boast a little
7184,2CO,11,NRSV,what i am saying in regard to this boastful confidence i am saying not with the lords authority but as a fool
7185,2CO,11,NRSV,since many boast according to human standards
7186,2CO,11,NRSV,i will also boast
7187,2CO,11,NRSV,for you gladly put up with fools being wise yourselves
7188,2CO,11,NRSV,for you put up with it when someone makes slaves of you or preys upon you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or gives you a slap in the face
7189,2CO,11,NRSV,to my shame i must say we were too weak for that
7190,2CO,11,NRSV,but whatever anyone dares to boast ofi am speaking as a fooli also dare to boast of that
7191,2CO,11,NRSV,are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they descendants of abraham so am i
7192,2CO,11,NRSV,are they ministers of christ i am talking like a madmani am a better one with far greater labors far more imprisonments with countless floggings and often near death
7193,2CO,11,NRSV,five times i have received from the jews the forty lashes minus one
7194,2CO,11,NRSV,three times i was beaten with rods once i received a stoning three times i was shipwrecked for a night and a day i was adrift at sea
7195,2CO,11,NRSV,on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from bandits danger from my own people danger from gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers and sisters
7196,2CO,11,NRSV,in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night hungry and thirsty often without food cold and naked
7197,2CO,11,NRSV,and besides other things i am under daily pressure because of my anxiety for all the churches
7198,2CO,11,NRSV,who is weak and i am not weak who is made to stumble and i am not indignant
7199,2CO,11,NRSV,if i must boast i will boast of the things that show my weakness
7200,2CO,11,NRSV,the god and father of the lord jesus blessed be he forever knows that i do not lie
7201,2CO,11,NRSV,in damascus the governor
7202,2CO,11,NRSV,under king aretas guarded the city of damascus in order to
7203,2CO,11,NRSV,seize me
7204,2CO,11,NRSV,but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall
7205,2CO,11,NRSV,and escaped from his hands
7206,2CO,12,NRSV,it is necessary to boast nothing is to be gained by it but i will go on to visions and revelations of the lord
7207,2CO,12,NRSV,i know a person in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heavenwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows
7208,2CO,12,NRSV,and i know that such a personwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows
7209,2CO,12,NRSV,was caught up into paradise and heard things that are not to be told that no mortal is permitted to repeat
7210,2CO,12,NRSV,on behalf of such a one i will boast but on my own behalf i will not boast except of my weaknesses
7211,2CO,12,NRSV,but if i wish to boast i will not be a fool for i will be speaking the truth but i refrain from it so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me
7212,2CO,12,NRSV,even considering the exceptional character of the revelations therefore to keep
7213,2CO,12,NRSV,me from being too elated a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to torment me to keep me from being too elated
7214,2CO,12,NRSV,three times i appealed to the lord about this that it would leave me
7215,2CO,12,NRSV,but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power
7216,2CO,12,NRSV,is made perfect in weakness so i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may dwell in me
7217,2CO,12,NRSV,therefore i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for the sake of christ for whenever i am weak then i am strong
7218,2CO,12,NRSV,i have been a fool you forced me to it indeed you should have been the ones commending me for i am not at all inferior to these superapostles even though i am nothing
7219,2CO,12,NRSV,the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience signs and wonders and mighty works
7220,2CO,12,NRSV,how have you been worse off than the other churches except that i myself did not burden you forgive me this wrong
7221,2CO,12,NRSV,here i am ready to come to you this third time and i will not be a burden because i do not want what is yours but you for children ought not to lay up for their parents but parents for their children
7222,2CO,12,NRSV,i will most gladly spend and be spent for you if i love you more am i to be loved less
7223,2CO,12,NRSV,let it be assumed that i did not burden you nevertheless you say since i was crafty i took you in by deceit
7224,2CO,12,NRSV,did i take advantage of you through any of those whom i sent to you
7225,2CO,12,NRSV,i urged titus to go and sent the brother with him titus did not take advantage of you did he did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit did we not take the same steps
7226,2CO,12,NRSV,have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you we are speaking in christ before god everything we do beloved is for the sake of building you up
7227,2CO,12,NRSV,for i fear that when i come i may find you not as i wish and that you may find me not as you wish i fear that there may perhaps be quarreling jealousy anger selfishness slander gossip conceit and disorder
7228,2CO,12,NRSV,i fear that when i come again my god may humble me before you and that i may have to mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced
7229,2CO,13,NRSV,this is the third time i am coming to you any charge must be sustained by the evidence of two or three witnesses
7230,2CO,13,NRSV,i warned those who sinned previously and all the others and i warn them now while absent as i did when present on my second visit that if i come again i will not be lenient
7231,2CO,13,NRSV,since you desire proof that christ is speaking in me he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful in you
7232,2CO,13,NRSV,for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god for we are weak in him
7233,2CO,13,NRSV,but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of god
7234,2CO,13,NRSV,examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith test yourselves do you not realize that jesus christ is in youunless indeed you fail to meet the test
7235,2CO,13,NRSV,i hope you will find out that we have not failed
7236,2CO,13,NRSV,but we pray to god that you may not do anything wrongnot that we may appear to have met the test but that you may do what is right though we may seem to have failed
7237,2CO,13,NRSV,for we cannot do anything against the truth but only for the truth
7238,2CO,13,NRSV,for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong this is what we pray for that you may become perfect
7239,2CO,13,NRSV,so i write these things while i am away from you so that when i come i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down
7240,2CO,13,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters
7241,2CO,13,NRSV,farewell
7242,2CO,13,NRSV,put things in order listen to my appeal
7243,2CO,13,NRSV,agree with one another live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you
7244,2CO,13,NRSV,greet one another with a holy kiss all the saints greet you
7245,2CO,13,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god and the communion of
7246,2CO,13,NRSV,the holy spirit be with all of you
7247,GAL,1,NRSV,paul an apostlesent neither by human commission nor from human authorities but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead
7248,GAL,1,NRSV,and all the members of gods family
7249,GAL,1,NRSV,who are with me
7250,GAL,1,NRSV,to the churches of galatia
7251,GAL,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
7252,GAL,1,NRSV,who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age according to the will of our god and father
7253,GAL,1,NRSV,to whom be the glory forever and ever amen
7254,GAL,1,NRSV,i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel
7255,GAL,1,NRSV,not that there is another gospel but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of christ
7256,GAL,1,NRSV,but even if we or an angel
7257,GAL,1,NRSV,from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you let that one be accursed
7258,GAL,1,NRSV,as we have said before so now i repeat if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received let that one be accursed
7259,GAL,1,NRSV,am i now seeking human approval or gods approval or am i trying to please people if i were still pleasing people i would not be a servant
7260,GAL,1,NRSV,of christ
7261,GAL,1,NRSV,for i want you to know brothers and sisters
7262,GAL,1,NRSV,that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin
7263,GAL,1,NRSV,for i did not receive it from a human source nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ
7264,GAL,1,NRSV,you have heard no doubt of my earlier life in judaism i was violently persecuting the church of god and was trying to destroy it
7265,GAL,1,NRSV,i advanced in judaism beyond many among my people of the same age for i was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors
7266,GAL,1,NRSV,but when god who had set me apart before i was born and called me through his grace was pleased
7267,GAL,1,NRSV,to reveal his son to me
7268,GAL,1,NRSV,so that i might proclaim him among the gentiles i did not confer with any human being
7269,GAL,1,NRSV,nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me but i went away at once into arabia and afterwards i returned to damascus
7270,GAL,1,NRSV,then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit cephas and stayed with him fifteen days
7271,GAL,1,NRSV,but i did not see any other apostle except james the lords brother
7272,GAL,1,NRSV,in what i am writing to you before god i do not lie
7273,GAL,1,NRSV,then i went into the regions of syria and cilicia
7274,GAL,1,NRSV,and i was still unknown by sight to the churches of judea that are in christ
7275,GAL,1,NRSV,they only heard it said the one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy
7276,GAL,1,NRSV,and they glorified god because of me
7277,GAL,2,NRSV,then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus along with me
7278,GAL,2,NRSV,i went up in response to a revelation then i laid before them though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders the gospel that i proclaim among the gentiles in order to make sure that i was not running or had not run in vain
7279,GAL,2,NRSV,but even titus who was with me was not compelled to be circumcised though he was a greek
7280,GAL,2,NRSV,but because of false believers
7281,GAL,2,NRSV,secretly brought in who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus so that they might enslave us
7282,GAL,2,NRSV,we did not submit to them even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you
7283,GAL,2,NRSV,and from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders what they actually were makes no difference to me god shows no partialitythose leaders contributed nothing to me
7284,GAL,2,NRSV,on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised
7285,GAL,2,NRSV,for he who worked through peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the gentiles
7286,GAL,2,NRSV,and when james and cephas and john who were acknowledged pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave to barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised
7287,GAL,2,NRSV,they asked only one thing that we remember the poor which was actually what i was
7288,GAL,2,NRSV,eager to do
7289,GAL,2,NRSV,but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood selfcondemned
7290,GAL,2,NRSV,for until certain people came from james he used to eat with the gentiles but after they came he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction
7291,GAL,2,NRSV,and the other jews joined him in this hypocrisy so that even barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy
7292,GAL,2,NRSV,but when i saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel i said to cephas before them all if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you compel the gentiles to live like jews
7293,GAL,2,NRSV,we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners
7294,GAL,2,NRSV,yet we know that a person is justified
7295,GAL,2,NRSV,not by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ
7296,GAL,2,NRSV,and we have come to believe in christ jesus so that we might be justified by faith in christ
7297,GAL,2,NRSV,and not by doing the works of the law because no one will be justified by the works of the law
7298,GAL,2,NRSV,but if in our effort to be justified in christ we ourselves have been found to be sinners is christ then a servant of sin certainly not
7299,GAL,2,NRSV,but if i build up again the very things that i once tore down then i demonstrate that i am a transgressor
7300,GAL,2,NRSV,for through the law i died to the law so that i might live to god i have been crucified with christ
7301,GAL,2,NRSV,and it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god
7302,GAL,2,NRSV,who loved me and gave himself for me
7303,GAL,2,NRSV,i do not nullify the grace of god for if justification
7304,GAL,2,NRSV,comes through the law then christ died for nothing
7305,GAL,3,NRSV,you foolish galatians who has bewitched you it was before your eyes that jesus christ was publicly exhibited as crucified
7306,GAL,3,NRSV,the only thing i want to learn from you is this did you receive the spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard
7307,GAL,3,NRSV,are you so foolish having started with the spirit are you now ending with the flesh
7308,GAL,3,NRSV,did you experience so much for nothingif it really was for nothing
7309,GAL,3,NRSV,well then does god
7310,GAL,3,NRSV,supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard
7311,GAL,3,NRSV,just as abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness
7312,GAL,3,NRSV,so you see those who believe are the descendants of abraham
7313,GAL,3,NRSV,and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith declared the gospel beforehand to abraham saying all the gentiles shall be blessed in you
7314,GAL,3,NRSV,for this reason those who believe are blessed with abraham who believed
7315,GAL,3,NRSV,for all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law
7316,GAL,3,NRSV,now it is evident that no one is justified before god by the law for the one who is righteous will live by faith
7317,GAL,3,NRSV,but the law does not rest on faith on the contrary whoever does the works of the law
7318,GAL,3,NRSV,will live by them
7319,GAL,3,NRSV,christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for usfor it is written cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree
7320,GAL,3,NRSV,in order that in christ jesus the blessing of abraham might come to the gentiles so that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
7321,GAL,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters
7322,GAL,3,NRSV,i give an example from daily life once a persons will
7323,GAL,3,NRSV,has been ratified no one adds to it or annuls it
7324,GAL,3,NRSV,now the promises were made to abraham and to his offspring
7325,GAL,3,NRSV,it does not say and to offsprings
7326,GAL,3,NRSV,as of many but it says and to your offspring
7327,GAL,3,NRSV,that is to one person who is christ
7328,GAL,3,NRSV,my point is this the law which came four hundred thirty years later does not annul a covenant previously ratified by god so as to nullify the promise
7329,GAL,3,NRSV,for if the inheritance comes from the law it no longer comes from the promise but god granted it to abraham through the promise
7330,GAL,3,NRSV,why then the law it was added because of transgressions until the offspring
7331,GAL,3,NRSV,would come to whom the promise had been made and it was ordained through angels by a mediator
7332,GAL,3,NRSV,now a mediator involves more than one party but god is one
7333,GAL,3,NRSV,is the law then opposed to the promises of god certainly not for if a law had been given that could make alive then righteousness would indeed come through the law
7334,GAL,3,NRSV,but the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin so that what was promised through faith in jesus christ
7335,GAL,3,NRSV,might be given to those who believe
7336,GAL,3,NRSV,now before faith came we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed
7337,GAL,3,NRSV,therefore the law was our disciplinarian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith
7338,GAL,3,NRSV,but now that faith has come we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian
7339,GAL,3,NRSV,for in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith
7340,GAL,3,NRSV,as many of you as were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ
7341,GAL,3,NRSV,there is no longer jew or greek there is no longer slave or free there is no longer male and female for all of you are one in christ jesus
7342,GAL,3,NRSV,and if you belong to christ then you are abrahams offspring
7343,GAL,3,NRSV,heirs according to the promise
7344,GAL,4,NRSV,my point is this heirs as long as they are minors are no better than slaves though they are the owners of all the property
7345,GAL,4,NRSV,but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father
7346,GAL,4,NRSV,so with us while we were minors we were enslaved to the elemental spirits
7347,GAL,4,NRSV,of the world
7348,GAL,4,NRSV,but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law
7349,GAL,4,NRSV,in order to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as children
7350,GAL,4,NRSV,and because you are children god has sent the spirit of his son into our
7351,GAL,4,NRSV,hearts crying abba
7352,GAL,4,NRSV,father
7353,GAL,4,NRSV,so you are no longer a slave but a child and if a child then also an heir through god
7354,GAL,4,NRSV,formerly when you did not know god you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods
7355,GAL,4,NRSV,now however that you have come to know god or rather to be known by god how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits
7356,GAL,4,NRSV,how can you want to be enslaved to them again
7357,GAL,4,NRSV,you are observing special days and months and seasons and years
7358,GAL,4,NRSV,i am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted
7359,GAL,4,NRSV,friends
7360,GAL,4,NRSV,i beg you become as i am for i also have become as you are you have done me no wrong
7361,GAL,4,NRSV,you know that it was because of a physical infirmity that i first announced the gospel to you
7362,GAL,4,NRSV,though my condition put you to the test you did not scorn or despise me but welcomed me as an angel of god as christ jesus
7363,GAL,4,NRSV,what has become of the goodwill you felt for i testify that had it been possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me
7364,GAL,4,NRSV,have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth
7365,GAL,4,NRSV,they make much of you but for no good purpose they want to exclude you so that you may make much of them
7366,GAL,4,NRSV,it is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times and not only when i am present with you
7367,GAL,4,NRSV,my little children for whom i am again in the pain of childbirth until christ is formed in you
7368,GAL,4,NRSV,i wish i were present with you now and could change my tone for i am perplexed about you
7369,GAL,4,NRSV,tell me you who desire to be subject to the law will you not listen to the law
7370,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written that abraham had two sons one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman
7371,GAL,4,NRSV,one the child of the slave was born according to the flesh the other the child of the free woman was born through the promise
7372,GAL,4,NRSV,now this is an allegory these women are two covenants one woman in fact is hagar from mount sinai bearing children for slavery
7373,GAL,4,NRSV,now hagar is mount sinai in arabia
7374,GAL,4,NRSV,and corresponds to the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children
7375,GAL,4,NRSV,but the other woman corresponds to the jerusalem above she is free and she is our mother
7376,GAL,4,NRSV,for it is written
7377,GAL,4,NRSV,rejoice you childless one you who bear no children
7378,GAL,4,NRSV,burst into song and shout you who endure no birth pangs
7379,GAL,4,NRSV,for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous
7380,GAL,4,NRSV,than the children of the one who is married
7381,GAL,4,NRSV,now you
7382,GAL,4,NRSV,my friends
7383,GAL,4,NRSV,are children of the promise like isaac
7384,GAL,4,NRSV,but just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the spirit so it is now also
7385,GAL,4,NRSV,but what does the scripture say drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman
7386,GAL,4,NRSV,so then friends
7387,GAL,4,NRSV,we are children not of the slave but of the free woman
7388,GAL,5,NRSV,for freedom christ has set us free stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery
7389,GAL,5,NRSV,listen i paul am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you
7390,GAL,5,NRSV,once again i testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law
7391,GAL,5,NRSV,you who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from christ you have fallen away from grace
7392,GAL,5,NRSV,for through the spirit by faith we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness
7393,GAL,5,NRSV,for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything the only thing that counts is faith working
7394,GAL,5,NRSV,through love
7395,GAL,5,NRSV,you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth
7396,GAL,5,NRSV,such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you
7397,GAL,5,NRSV,a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough
7398,GAL,5,NRSV,i am confident about you in the lord that you will not think otherwise but whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty
7399,GAL,5,NRSV,but my friends
7400,GAL,5,NRSV,why am i still being persecuted if i am still preaching circumcision in that case the offense of the cross has been removed
7401,GAL,5,NRSV,i wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves
7402,GAL,5,NRSV,for you were called to freedom brothers and sisters
7403,GAL,5,NRSV,only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for selfindulgence
7404,GAL,5,NRSV,but through love become slaves to one another
7405,GAL,5,NRSV,for the whole law is summed up in a single commandment you shall love your neighbor as yourself
7406,GAL,5,NRSV,if however you bite and devour one another take care that you are not consumed by one another
7407,GAL,5,NRSV,live by the spirit i say and do not gratify the desires of the flesh
7408,GAL,5,NRSV,for what the flesh desires is opposed to the spirit and what the spirit desires is opposed to the flesh for these are opposed to each other to prevent you from doing what you want
7409,GAL,5,NRSV,but if you are led by the spirit you are not subject to the law
7410,GAL,5,NRSV,now the works of the flesh are obvious fornication impurity licentiousness
7411,GAL,5,NRSV,idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousy anger quarrels dissensions factions
7412,GAL,5,NRSV,envy
7413,GAL,5,NRSV,drunkenness carousing and things like these i am warning you as i warned you before those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god
7414,GAL,5,NRSV,by contrast the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness generosity faithfulness
7415,GAL,5,NRSV,gentleness and selfcontrol there is no law against such things
7416,GAL,5,NRSV,and those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires
7417,GAL,5,NRSV,if we live by the spirit let us also be guided by the spirit
7418,GAL,5,NRSV,let us not become conceited competing against one another envying one another
7419,GAL,6,NRSV,my friends
7420,GAL,6,NRSV,if anyone is detected in a transgression you who have received the spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness take care that you yourselves are not tempted
7421,GAL,6,NRSV,bear one anothers burdens and in this way you will fulfill
7422,GAL,6,NRSV,the law of christ
7423,GAL,6,NRSV,for if those who are nothing think they are something they deceive themselves
7424,GAL,6,NRSV,all must test their own work then that work rather than their neighbors work will become a cause for pride
7425,GAL,6,NRSV,for all must carry their own loads
7426,GAL,6,NRSV,those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher
7427,GAL,6,NRSV,do not be deceived god is not mocked for you reap whatever you sow
7428,GAL,6,NRSV,if you sow to your own flesh you will reap corruption from the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you will reap eternal life from the spirit
7429,GAL,6,NRSV,so let us not grow weary in doing what is right for we will reap at harvest time if we do not give up
7430,GAL,6,NRSV,so then whenever we have an opportunity let us work for the good of all and especially for those of the family of faith
7431,GAL,6,NRSV,see what large letters i make when i am writing in my own hand
7432,GAL,6,NRSV,it is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcisedonly that they may not be persecuted for the cross of christ
7433,GAL,6,NRSV,even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh
7434,GAL,6,NRSV,may i never boast of anything except the cross of our lord jesus christ by which
7435,GAL,6,NRSV,the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
7436,GAL,6,NRSV,for
7437,GAL,6,NRSV,neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything but a new creation is everything
7438,GAL,6,NRSV,as for those who will follow this rulepeace be upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god
7439,GAL,6,NRSV,from now on let no one make trouble for me for i carry the marks of jesus branded on my body
7440,GAL,6,NRSV,may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers and sisters
7441,GAL,6,NRSV,amen
7442,EPH,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god
7443,EPH,1,NRSV,to the saints who are in ephesus and are faithful
7444,EPH,1,NRSV,in christ jesus
7445,EPH,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
7446,EPH,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us in christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places
7447,EPH,1,NRSV,just as he chose us in christ
7448,EPH,1,NRSV,before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love
7449,EPH,1,NRSV,he destined us for adoption as his children through jesus christ according to the good pleasure of his will
7450,EPH,1,NRSV,to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the beloved
7451,EPH,1,NRSV,in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace
7452,EPH,1,NRSV,that he lavished on us with all wisdom and insight
7453,EPH,1,NRSV,he has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure that he set forth in christ
7454,EPH,1,NRSV,as a plan for the fullness of time to gather up all things in him things in heaven and things on earth
7455,EPH,1,NRSV,in christ we have also obtained an inheritance
7456,EPH,1,NRSV,having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will
7457,EPH,1,NRSV,so that we who were the first to set our hope on christ might live for the praise of his glory
7458,EPH,1,NRSV,in him you also when you had heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and had believed in him were marked with the seal of the promised holy spirit
7459,EPH,1,NRSV,this
7460,EPH,1,NRSV,is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as gods own people to the praise of his glory
7461,EPH,1,NRSV,i have heard of your faith in the lord jesus and your love
7462,EPH,1,NRSV,toward all the saints and for this reason
7463,EPH,1,NRSV,i do not cease to give thanks for you as i remember you in my prayers
7464,EPH,1,NRSV,i pray that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him
7465,EPH,1,NRSV,so that with the eyes of your heart enlightened you may know what is the hope to which he has called you what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints
7466,EPH,1,NRSV,and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe according to the working of his great power
7467,EPH,1,NRSV,god
7468,EPH,1,NRSV,put this power to work in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places
7469,EPH,1,NRSV,far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is named not only in this age but also in the age to come
7470,EPH,1,NRSV,and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church
7471,EPH,1,NRSV,which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all
7472,EPH,2,NRSV,you were dead through the trespasses and sins
7473,EPH,2,NRSV,in which you once lived following the course of this world following the ruler of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient
7474,EPH,2,NRSV,all of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh following the desires of flesh and senses and we were by nature children of wrath like everyone else
7475,EPH,2,NRSV,but god who is rich in mercy out of the great love with which he loved us
7476,EPH,2,NRSV,even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive together with christ
7477,EPH,2,NRSV,by grace you have been saved
7478,EPH,2,NRSV,and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus
7479,EPH,2,NRSV,so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus
7480,EPH,2,NRSV,for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god
7481,EPH,2,NRSV,not the result of works so that no one may boast
7482,EPH,2,NRSV,for we are what he has made us created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand to be our way of life
7483,EPH,2,NRSV,so then remember that at one time you gentiles by birth
7484,EPH,2,NRSV,called the uncircumcision by those who are called the circumcisiona physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands
7485,EPH,2,NRSV,remember that you were at that time without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers to the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world
7486,EPH,2,NRSV,but now in christ jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ
7487,EPH,2,NRSV,for he is our peace in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall that is the hostility between us
7488,EPH,2,NRSV,he has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two thus making peace
7489,EPH,2,NRSV,and might reconcile both groups to god in one body
7490,EPH,2,NRSV,through the cross thus putting to death that hostility through it
7491,EPH,2,NRSV,so he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near
7492,EPH,2,NRSV,for through him both of us have access in one spirit to the father
7493,EPH,2,NRSV,so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of god
7494,EPH,2,NRSV,built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the cornerstone
7495,EPH,2,NRSV,in him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the lord
7496,EPH,2,NRSV,in whom you also are built together spiritually
7497,EPH,2,NRSV,into a dwelling place for god
7498,EPH,3,NRSV,this is the reason that i paul am a prisoner for
7499,EPH,3,NRSV,christ jesus for the sake of you gentiles
7500,EPH,3,NRSV,for surely you have already heard of the commission of gods grace that was given me for you
7501,EPH,3,NRSV,and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation as i wrote above in a few words
7502,EPH,3,NRSV,a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of christ
7503,EPH,3,NRSV,in former generations this mystery
7504,EPH,3,NRSV,was not made known to humankind as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
7505,EPH,3,NRSV,that is the gentiles have become fellow heirs members of the same body and sharers in the promise in christ jesus through the gospel
7506,EPH,3,NRSV,of this gospel i have become a servant according to the gift of gods grace that was given me by the working of his power
7507,EPH,3,NRSV,although i am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to me to bring to the gentiles the news of the boundless riches of christ
7508,EPH,3,NRSV,and to make everyone see
7509,EPH,3,NRSV,what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in
7510,EPH,3,NRSV,god who created all things
7511,EPH,3,NRSV,so that through the church the wisdom of god in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places
7512,EPH,3,NRSV,this was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in christ jesus our lord
7513,EPH,3,NRSV,in whom we have access to god in boldness and confidence through faith in him
7514,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray therefore that you
7515,EPH,3,NRSV,may not lose heart over my sufferings for you they are your glory
7516,EPH,3,NRSV,for this reason i bow my knees before the father
7517,EPH,3,NRSV,from whom every family
7518,EPH,3,NRSV,in heaven and on earth takes its name
7519,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit
7520,EPH,3,NRSV,and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love
7521,EPH,3,NRSV,i pray that you may have the power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth
7522,EPH,3,NRSV,and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god
7523,EPH,3,NRSV,now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine
7524,EPH,3,NRSV,to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations forever and ever amen
7525,EPH,4,NRSV,i therefore the prisoner in the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called
7526,EPH,4,NRSV,with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love
7527,EPH,4,NRSV,making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
7528,EPH,4,NRSV,there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling
7529,EPH,4,NRSV,one lord one faith one baptism
7530,EPH,4,NRSV,one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in all
7531,EPH,4,NRSV,but each of us was given grace according to the measure of christs gift
7532,EPH,4,NRSV,therefore it is said
7533,EPH,4,NRSV,when he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive
7534,EPH,4,NRSV,he gave gifts to his people
7535,EPH,4,NRSV,when it says he ascended what does it mean but that he had also descended
7536,EPH,4,NRSV,into the lower parts of the earth
7537,EPH,4,NRSV,he who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things
7538,EPH,4,NRSV,the gifts he gave were that some would be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers
7539,EPH,4,NRSV,to equip the saints for the work of ministry for building up the body of christ
7540,EPH,4,NRSV,until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to maturity to the measure of the full stature of christ
7541,EPH,4,NRSV,we must no longer be children tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine by peoples trickery by their craftiness in deceitful scheming
7542,EPH,4,NRSV,but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ
7543,EPH,4,NRSV,from whom the whole body joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped as each part is working properly promotes the bodys growth in building itself up in love
7544,EPH,4,NRSV,now this i affirm and insist on in the lord you must no longer live as the gentiles live in the futility of their minds
7545,EPH,4,NRSV,they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of their ignorance and hardness of heart
7546,EPH,4,NRSV,they have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness greedy to practice every kind of impurity
7547,EPH,4,NRSV,that is not the way you learned christ
7548,EPH,4,NRSV,for surely you have heard about him and were taught in him as truth is in jesus
7549,EPH,4,NRSV,you were taught to put away your former way of life your old self corrupt and deluded by its lusts
7550,EPH,4,NRSV,and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds
7551,EPH,4,NRSV,and to clothe yourselves with the new self created according to the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness
7552,EPH,4,NRSV,so then putting away falsehood let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors for we are members of one another
7553,EPH,4,NRSV,be angry but do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger
7554,EPH,4,NRSV,and do not make room for the devil
7555,EPH,4,NRSV,thieves must give up stealing rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands so as to have something to share with the needy
7556,EPH,4,NRSV,let no evil talk come out of your mouths but only what is useful for building up
7557,EPH,4,NRSV,as there is need so that your words may give grace to those who hear
7558,EPH,4,NRSV,and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption
7559,EPH,4,NRSV,put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander together with all malice
7560,EPH,4,NRSV,and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ has forgiven you
7561,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore be imitators of god as beloved children
7562,EPH,5,NRSV,and live in love as christ loved us
7563,EPH,5,NRSV,and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god
7564,EPH,5,NRSV,but fornication and impurity of any kind or greed must not even be mentioned among you as is proper among saints
7565,EPH,5,NRSV,entirely out of place is obscene silly and vulgar talk but instead let there be thanksgiving
7566,EPH,5,NRSV,be sure of this that no fornicator or impure person or one who is greedy that is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
7567,EPH,5,NRSV,let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god comes on those who are disobedient
7568,EPH,5,NRSV,therefore do not be associated with them
7569,EPH,5,NRSV,for once you were darkness but now in the lord you are light live as children of light
7570,EPH,5,NRSV,for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true
7571,EPH,5,NRSV,try to find out what is pleasing to the lord
7572,EPH,5,NRSV,take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness but instead expose them
7573,EPH,5,NRSV,for it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly
7574,EPH,5,NRSV,but everything exposed by the light becomes visible
7575,EPH,5,NRSV,for everything that becomes visible is light therefore it says
7576,EPH,5,NRSV,sleeper awake
7577,EPH,5,NRSV,rise from the dead
7578,EPH,5,NRSV,and christ will shine on you
7579,EPH,5,NRSV,be careful then how you live not as unwise people but as wise
7580,EPH,5,NRSV,making the most of the time because the days are evil
7581,EPH,5,NRSV,so do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is
7582,EPH,5,NRSV,do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery but be filled with the spirit
7583,EPH,5,NRSV,as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves singing and making melody to the lord in your hearts
7584,EPH,5,NRSV,giving thanks to god the father at all times and for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ
7585,EPH,5,NRSV,be subject to one another out of reverence for christ
7586,EPH,5,NRSV,wives be subject to your husbands as you are to the lord
7587,EPH,5,NRSV,for the husband is the head of the wife just as christ is the head of the church the body of which he is the savior
7588,EPH,5,NRSV,just as the church is subject to christ so also wives ought to be in everything to their husbands
7589,EPH,5,NRSV,husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
7590,EPH,5,NRSV,in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word
7591,EPH,5,NRSV,so as to present the church to himself in splendor without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kindyes so that she may be holy and without blemish
7592,EPH,5,NRSV,in the same way husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself
7593,EPH,5,NRSV,for no one ever hates his own body but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it just as christ does for the church
7594,EPH,5,NRSV,because we are members of his body
7595,EPH,5,NRSV,for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
7596,EPH,5,NRSV,this is a great mystery and i am applying it to christ and the church
7597,EPH,5,NRSV,each of you however should love his wife as himself and a wife should respect her husband
7598,EPH,6,NRSV,children obey your parents in the lord
7599,EPH,6,NRSV,for this is right
7600,EPH,6,NRSV,honor your father and motherthis is the first commandment with a promise
7601,EPH,6,NRSV,so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth
7602,EPH,6,NRSV,and fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord
7603,EPH,6,NRSV,slaves obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as you obey christ
7604,EPH,6,NRSV,not only while being watched and in order to please them but as slaves of christ doing the will of god from the heart
7605,EPH,6,NRSV,render service with enthusiasm as to the lord and not to men and women
7606,EPH,6,NRSV,knowing that whatever good we do we will receive the same again from the lord whether we are slaves or free
7607,EPH,6,NRSV,and masters do the same to them stop threatening them for you know that both of you have the same master in heaven and with him there is no partiality
7608,EPH,6,NRSV,finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his power
7609,EPH,6,NRSV,put on the whole armor of god so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
7610,EPH,6,NRSV,for our
7611,EPH,6,NRSV,struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers of this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places
7612,EPH,6,NRSV,therefore take up the whole armor of god so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day and having done everything to stand firm
7613,EPH,6,NRSV,stand therefore and fasten the belt of truth around your waist and put on the breastplate of righteousness
7614,EPH,6,NRSV,as shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace
7615,EPH,6,NRSV,with all of these
7616,EPH,6,NRSV,take the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one
7617,EPH,6,NRSV,take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
7618,EPH,6,NRSV,pray in the spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication to that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints
7619,EPH,6,NRSV,pray also for me so that when i speak a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel
7620,EPH,6,NRSV,for which i am an ambassador in chains pray that i may declare it boldly as i must speak
7621,EPH,6,NRSV,so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing tychicus will tell you everything he is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the lord
7622,EPH,6,NRSV,i am sending him to you for this very purpose to let you know how we are and to encourage your hearts
7623,EPH,6,NRSV,peace be to the whole community
7624,EPH,6,NRSV,and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
7625,EPH,6,NRSV,grace be with all who have an undying love for our lord jesus christ
7626,PHP,1,NRSV,paul and timothy servants
7627,PHP,1,NRSV,of christ jesus
7628,PHP,1,NRSV,to all the saints in christ jesus who are in philippi with the bishops
7629,PHP,1,NRSV,and deacons
7630,PHP,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
7631,PHP,1,NRSV,i thank my god every time i remember you
7632,PHP,1,NRSV,constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you
7633,PHP,1,NRSV,because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now
7634,PHP,1,NRSV,i am confident of this that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of jesus christ
7635,PHP,1,NRSV,it is right for me to think this way about all of you because you hold me in your heart
7636,PHP,1,NRSV,for all of you share in gods grace
7637,PHP,1,NRSV,with me both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel
7638,PHP,1,NRSV,for god is my witness how i long for all of you with the compassion of christ jesus
7639,PHP,1,NRSV,and this is my prayer that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight
7640,PHP,1,NRSV,to help you to determine what is best so that in the day of christ you may be pure and blameless
7641,PHP,1,NRSV,having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through jesus christ for the glory and praise of god
7642,PHP,1,NRSV,i want you to know beloved
7643,PHP,1,NRSV,that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel
7644,PHP,1,NRSV,so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard
7645,PHP,1,NRSV,and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for christ
7646,PHP,1,NRSV,and most of the brothers and sisters
7647,PHP,1,NRSV,having been made confident in the lord by my imprisonment dare to speak the word
7648,PHP,1,NRSV,with greater boldness and without fear
7649,PHP,1,NRSV,some proclaim christ from envy and rivalry but others from goodwill
7650,PHP,1,NRSV,these proclaim christ out of love knowing that i have been put here for the defense of the gospel
7651,PHP,1,NRSV,the others proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment
7652,PHP,1,NRSV,what does it matter just this that christ is proclaimed in every way whether out of false motives or true and in that i rejoice
7653,PHP,1,NRSV,yes and i will continue to rejoice
7654,PHP,1,NRSV,for i know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ this will turn out for my deliverance
7655,PHP,1,NRSV,it is my eager expectation and hope that i will not be put to shame in any way but that by my speaking with all boldness christ will be exalted now as always in my body whether by life or by death
7656,PHP,1,NRSV,for to me living is christ and dying is gain
7657,PHP,1,NRSV,if i am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me and i do not know which i prefer
7658,PHP,1,NRSV,i am hard pressed between the two my desire is to depart and be with christ for that is far better
7659,PHP,1,NRSV,but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you
7660,PHP,1,NRSV,since i am convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith
7661,PHP,1,NRSV,so that i may share abundantly in your boasting in christ jesus when i come to you again
7662,PHP,1,NRSV,only live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come and see you or am absent and hear about you i will know that you are standing firm in one spirit striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel
7663,PHP,1,NRSV,and are in no way intimidated by your opponents for them this is evidence of their destruction but of your salvation and this is gods doing
7664,PHP,1,NRSV,for he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in christ but of suffering for him as well
7665,PHP,1,NRSV,since you are having the same struggle that you saw i had and now hear that i still have
7666,PHP,2,NRSV,if then there is any encouragement in christ any consolation from love any sharing in the spirit any compassion and sympathy
7667,PHP,2,NRSV,make my joy complete be of the same mind having the same love being in full accord and of one mind
7668,PHP,2,NRSV,do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit but in humility regard others as better than yourselves
7669,PHP,2,NRSV,let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others
7670,PHP,2,NRSV,let the same mind be in you that was
7671,PHP,2,NRSV,in christ jesus
7672,PHP,2,NRSV,who though he was in the form of god
7673,PHP,2,NRSV,did not regard equality with god
7674,PHP,2,NRSV,as something to be exploited
7675,PHP,2,NRSV,but emptied himself
7676,PHP,2,NRSV,taking the form of a slave
7677,PHP,2,NRSV,being born in human likeness
7678,PHP,2,NRSV,and being found in human form
7679,PHP,2,NRSV,he humbled himself
7680,PHP,2,NRSV,and became obedient to the point of death
7681,PHP,2,NRSV,even death on a cross
7682,PHP,2,NRSV,therefore god also highly exalted him
7683,PHP,2,NRSV,and gave him the name
7684,PHP,2,NRSV,that is above every name
7685,PHP,2,NRSV,so that at the name of jesus
7686,PHP,2,NRSV,every knee should bend
7687,PHP,2,NRSV,in heaven and on earth and under the earth
7688,PHP,2,NRSV,and every tongue should confess
7689,PHP,2,NRSV,that jesus christ is lord
7690,PHP,2,NRSV,to the glory of god the father
7691,PHP,2,NRSV,therefore my beloved just as you have always obeyed me not only in my presence but much more now in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
7692,PHP,2,NRSV,for it is god who is at work in you enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
7693,PHP,2,NRSV,do all things without murmuring and arguing
7694,PHP,2,NRSV,so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation in which you shine like stars in the world
7695,PHP,2,NRSV,it is by your holding fast to the word of life that i can boast on the day of christ that i did not run in vain or labor in vain
7696,PHP,2,NRSV,but even if i am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you
7697,PHP,2,NRSV,and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me
7698,PHP,2,NRSV,i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon so that i may be cheered by news of you
7699,PHP,2,NRSV,i have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare
7700,PHP,2,NRSV,all of them are seeking their own interests not those of jesus christ
7701,PHP,2,NRSV,but timothys
7702,PHP,2,NRSV,worth you know how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel
7703,PHP,2,NRSV,i hope therefore to send him as soon as i see how things go with me
7704,PHP,2,NRSV,and i trust in the lord that i will also come soon
7705,PHP,2,NRSV,still i think it necessary to send to you epaphroditusmy brother and coworker and fellow soldier your messenger
7706,PHP,2,NRSV,and minister to my need
7707,PHP,2,NRSV,for he has been longing for
7708,PHP,2,NRSV,all of you and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill
7709,PHP,2,NRSV,he was indeed so ill that he nearly died but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me also so that i would not have one sorrow after another
7710,PHP,2,NRSV,i am the more eager to send him therefore in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again and that i may be less anxious
7711,PHP,2,NRSV,welcome him then in the lord with all joy and honor such people
7712,PHP,2,NRSV,because he came close to death for the work of christ
7713,PHP,2,NRSV,risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me
7714,PHP,3,NRSV,finally my brothers and sisters
7715,PHP,3,NRSV,rejoice
7716,PHP,3,NRSV,in the lord
7717,PHP,3,NRSV,to write the same things to you is not troublesome to me and for you it is a safeguard
7718,PHP,3,NRSV,beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of those who mutilate the flesh
7719,PHP,3,NRSV,for it is we who are the circumcision who worship in the spirit of god
7720,PHP,3,NRSV,and boast in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
7721,PHP,3,NRSV,even though i too have reason for confidence in the flesh
7722,PHP,3,NRSV,if anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh i have more
7723,PHP,3,NRSV,circumcised on the eighth day a member of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew born of hebrews as to the law a pharisee
7724,PHP,3,NRSV,as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless
7725,PHP,3,NRSV,yet whatever gains i had these i have come to regard as loss because of christ
7726,PHP,3,NRSV,more than that i regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and i regard them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ
7727,PHP,3,NRSV,and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but one that comes through faith in christ
7728,PHP,3,NRSV,the righteousness from god based on faith
7729,PHP,3,NRSV,i want to know christ
7730,PHP,3,NRSV,and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death
7731,PHP,3,NRSV,if somehow i may attain the resurrection from the dead
7732,PHP,3,NRSV,not that i have already obtained this or have already reached the goal
7733,PHP,3,NRSV,but i press on to make it my own because christ jesus has made me his own
7734,PHP,3,NRSV,beloved
7735,PHP,3,NRSV,i do not consider that i have made it my own
7736,PHP,3,NRSV,but this one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead
7737,PHP,3,NRSV,i press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly
7738,PHP,3,NRSV,call of god in christ jesus
7739,PHP,3,NRSV,let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind and if you think differently about anything this too god will reveal to you
7740,PHP,3,NRSV,only let us hold fast to what we have attained
7741,PHP,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters
7742,PHP,3,NRSV,join in imitating me and observe those who live according to the example you have in us
7743,PHP,3,NRSV,for many live as enemies of the cross of christ i have often told you of them and now i tell you even with tears
7744,PHP,3,NRSV,their end is destruction their god is the belly and their glory is in their shame their minds are set on earthly things
7745,PHP,3,NRSV,but our citizenship
7746,PHP,3,NRSV,is in heaven and it is from there that we are expecting a savior the lord jesus christ
7747,PHP,3,NRSV,he will transform the body of our humiliation
7748,PHP,3,NRSV,that it may be conformed to the body of his glory
7749,PHP,3,NRSV,by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself
7750,PHP,4,NRSV,therefore my brothers and sisters
7751,PHP,4,NRSV,whom i love and long for my joy and crown stand firm in the lord in this way my beloved
7752,PHP,4,NRSV,i urge euodia and i urge syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord
7753,PHP,4,NRSV,yes and i ask you also my loyal companion
7754,PHP,4,NRSV,help these women for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel together with clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the book of life
7755,PHP,4,NRSV,rejoice
7756,PHP,4,NRSV,in the lord always again i will say rejoice
7757,PHP,4,NRSV,let your gentleness be known to everyone the lord is near
7758,PHP,4,NRSV,do not worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god
7759,PHP,4,NRSV,and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
7760,PHP,4,NRSV,finally beloved
7761,PHP,4,NRSV,whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever is commendable if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise think about
7762,PHP,4,NRSV,these things
7763,PHP,4,NRSV,keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and the god of peace will be with you
7764,PHP,4,NRSV,i rejoice
7765,PHP,4,NRSV,in the lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me indeed you were concerned for me but had no opportunity to show it
7766,PHP,4,NRSV,not that i am referring to being in need for i have learned to be content with whatever i have
7767,PHP,4,NRSV,i know what it is to have little and i know what it is to have plenty in any and all circumstances i have learned the secret of being wellfed and of going hungry of having plenty and of being in need
7768,PHP,4,NRSV,i can do all things through him who strengthens me
7769,PHP,4,NRSV,in any case it was kind of you to share my distress
7770,PHP,4,NRSV,you philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel when i left macedonia no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone
7771,PHP,4,NRSV,for even when i was in thessalonica you sent me help for my needs more than once
7772,PHP,4,NRSV,not that i seek the gift but i seek the profit that accumulates to your account
7773,PHP,4,NRSV,i have been paid in full and have more than enough i am fully satisfied now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to god
7774,PHP,4,NRSV,and my god will fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory in christ jesus
7775,PHP,4,NRSV,to our god and father be glory forever and ever amen
7776,PHP,4,NRSV,greet every saint in christ jesus the friends
7777,PHP,4,NRSV,who are with me greet you
7778,PHP,4,NRSV,all the saints greet you especially those of the emperors household
7779,PHP,4,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit
7780,COL,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother
7781,COL,1,NRSV,to the saints and faithful brothers and sisters
7782,COL,1,NRSV,in christ in colossae
7783,COL,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father
7784,COL,1,NRSV,in our prayers for you we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ
7785,COL,1,NRSV,for we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints
7786,COL,1,NRSV,because of the hope laid up for you in heaven you have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth the gospel
7787,COL,1,NRSV,that has come to you just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of god
7788,COL,1,NRSV,this you learned from epaphras our beloved fellow servant
7789,COL,1,NRSV,he is a faithful minister of christ on your
7790,COL,1,NRSV,behalf
7791,COL,1,NRSV,and he has made known to us your love in the spirit
7792,COL,1,NRSV,for this reason since the day we heard it we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of gods
7793,COL,1,NRSV,will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding
7794,COL,1,NRSV,so that you may lead lives worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of god
7795,COL,1,NRSV,may you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience while joyfully
7796,COL,1,NRSV,giving thanks to the father who has enabled
7797,COL,1,NRSV,you
7798,COL,1,NRSV,to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light
7799,COL,1,NRSV,he has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son
7800,COL,1,NRSV,in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins
7801,COL,1,NRSV,he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation
7802,COL,1,NRSV,for in
7803,COL,1,NRSV,him all things in heaven and on earth were created things visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powersall things have been created through him and for him
7804,COL,1,NRSV,he himself is before all things and in
7805,COL,1,NRSV,him all things hold together
7806,COL,1,NRSV,he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might come to have first place in everything
7807,COL,1,NRSV,for in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell
7808,COL,1,NRSV,and through him god was pleased to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven by making peace through the blood of his cross
7809,COL,1,NRSV,and you who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds
7810,COL,1,NRSV,he has now reconciled
7811,COL,1,NRSV,in his fleshly body
7812,COL,1,NRSV,through death so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him
7813,COL,1,NRSV,provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven i paul became a servant of this gospel
7814,COL,1,NRSV,i am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh i am completing what is lacking in christs afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church
7815,COL,1,NRSV,i became its servant according to gods commission that was given to me for you to make the word of god fully known
7816,COL,1,NRSV,the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints
7817,COL,1,NRSV,to them god chose to make known how great among the gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory
7818,COL,1,NRSV,it is he whom we proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom so that we may present everyone mature in christ
7819,COL,1,NRSV,for this i toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me
7820,COL,2,NRSV,for i want you to know how much i am struggling for you and for those in laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face
7821,COL,2,NRSV,i want their hearts to be encouraged and united in love so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding and have the knowledge of gods mystery that is christ himself
7822,COL,2,NRSV,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
7823,COL,2,NRSV,i am saying this so that no one may deceive you with plausible arguments
7824,COL,2,NRSV,for though i am absent in body yet i am with you in spirit and i rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in christ
7825,COL,2,NRSV,as you therefore have received christ jesus the lord continue to live your lives
7826,COL,2,NRSV,in him
7827,COL,2,NRSV,rooted and built up in him and established in the faith just as you were taught abounding in thanksgiving
7828,COL,2,NRSV,see to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition according to the elemental spirits of the universe
7829,COL,2,NRSV,and not according to christ
7830,COL,2,NRSV,for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily
7831,COL,2,NRSV,and you have come to fullness in him who is the head of every ruler and authority
7832,COL,2,NRSV,in him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision
7833,COL,2,NRSV,by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ
7834,COL,2,NRSV,when you were buried with him in baptism you were also raised with him through faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead
7835,COL,2,NRSV,and when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god
7836,COL,2,NRSV,made you
7837,COL,2,NRSV,alive together with him when he forgave us all our trespasses
7838,COL,2,NRSV,erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands he set this aside nailing it to the cross
7839,COL,2,NRSV,he disarmed
7840,COL,2,NRSV,the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them triumphing over them in it
7841,COL,2,NRSV,therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals new moons or sabbaths
7842,COL,2,NRSV,these are only a shadow of what is to come but the substance belongs to christ
7843,COL,2,NRSV,do not let anyone disqualify you insisting on selfabasement and worship of angels dwelling
7844,COL,2,NRSV,on visions
7845,COL,2,NRSV,puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking
7846,COL,2,NRSV,and not holding fast to the head from whom the whole body nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows with a growth that is from god
7847,COL,2,NRSV,if with christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe
7848,COL,2,NRSV,why do you live as if you still belonged to the world why do you submit to regulations
7849,COL,2,NRSV,do not handle do not taste do not touch
7850,COL,2,NRSV,all these regulations refer to things that perish with use they are simply human commands and teachings
7851,COL,2,NRSV,these have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting selfimposed piety humility and severe treatment of the body but they are of no value in checking selfindulgence
7852,COL,3,NRSV,so if you have been raised with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god
7853,COL,3,NRSV,set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth
7854,COL,3,NRSV,for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god
7855,COL,3,NRSV,when christ who is your
7856,COL,3,NRSV,life is revealed then you also will be revealed with him in glory
7857,COL,3,NRSV,put to death therefore whatever in you is earthly fornication impurity passion evil desire and greed which is idolatry
7858,COL,3,NRSV,on account of these the wrath of god is coming on those who are disobedient
7859,COL,3,NRSV,these are the ways you also once followed when you were living that life
7860,COL,3,NRSV,but now you must get rid of all such thingsanger wrath malice slander and abusive
7861,COL,3,NRSV,language from your mouth
7862,COL,3,NRSV,do not lie to one another seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices
7863,COL,3,NRSV,and have clothed yourselves with the new self which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator
7864,COL,3,NRSV,in that renewal
7865,COL,3,NRSV,there is no longer greek and jew circumcised and uncircumcised barbarian scythian slave and free but christ is all and in all
7866,COL,3,NRSV,as gods chosen ones holy and beloved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility meekness and patience
7867,COL,3,NRSV,bear with one another and if anyone has a complaint against another forgive each other just as the lord
7868,COL,3,NRSV,has forgiven you so you also must forgive
7869,COL,3,NRSV,above all clothe yourselves with love which binds everything together in perfect harmony
7870,COL,3,NRSV,and let the peace of christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called in the one body and be thankful
7871,COL,3,NRSV,let the word of christ
7872,COL,3,NRSV,dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs to god
7873,COL,3,NRSV,and whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
7874,COL,3,NRSV,wives be subject to your husbands as is fitting in the lord
7875,COL,3,NRSV,husbands love your wives and never treat them harshly
7876,COL,3,NRSV,children obey your parents in everything for this is your acceptable duty in the lord
7877,COL,3,NRSV,fathers do not provoke your children or they may lose heart
7878,COL,3,NRSV,slaves obey your earthly masters
7879,COL,3,NRSV,in everything not only while being watched and in order to please them but wholeheartedly fearing the lord
7880,COL,3,NRSV,whatever your task put yourselves into it as done for the lord and not for your masters
7881,COL,3,NRSV,since you know that from the lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you serve
7882,COL,3,NRSV,the lord christ
7883,COL,3,NRSV,for the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done and there is no partiality
7884,COL,4,NRSV,masters treat your slaves justly and fairly for you know that you also have a master in heaven
7885,COL,4,NRSV,devote yourselves to prayer keeping alert in it with thanksgiving
7886,COL,4,NRSV,at the same time pray for us as well that god will open to us a door for the word that we may declare the mystery of christ for which i am in prison
7887,COL,4,NRSV,so that i may reveal it clearly as i should
7888,COL,4,NRSV,conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders making the most of the time
7889,COL,4,NRSV,let your speech always be gracious seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone
7890,COL,4,NRSV,tychicus will tell you all the news about me he is a beloved brother a faithful minister and a fellow servant
7891,COL,4,NRSV,in the lord
7892,COL,4,NRSV,i have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know how we are
7893,COL,4,NRSV,and that he may encourage your hearts
7894,COL,4,NRSV,he is coming with onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they will tell you about everything here
7895,COL,4,NRSV,aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you as does mark the cousin of barnabas concerning whom you have received instructionsif he comes to you welcome him
7896,COL,4,NRSV,and jesus who is called justus greets you these are the only ones of the circumcision among my coworkers for the kingdom of god and they have been a comfort to me
7897,COL,4,NRSV,epaphras who is one of you a servant
7898,COL,4,NRSV,of christ jesus greets you he is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that god wills
7899,COL,4,NRSV,for i testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in laodicea and in hierapolis
7900,COL,4,NRSV,luke the beloved physician and demas greet you
7901,COL,4,NRSV,give my greetings to the brothers and sisters
7902,COL,4,NRSV,in laodicea and to nympha and the church in her house
7903,COL,4,NRSV,and when this letter has been read among you have it read also in the church of the laodiceans and see that you read also the letter from laodicea
7904,COL,4,NRSV,and say to archippus see that you complete the task that you have received in the lord
7905,COL,4,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand remember my chains grace be with you
7906,1TH,1,NRSV,paul silvanus and timothy
7907,1TH,1,NRSV,to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ
7908,1TH,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace
7909,1TH,1,NRSV,we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly
7910,1TH,1,NRSV,remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ
7911,1TH,1,NRSV,for we know brothers and sisters
7912,1TH,1,NRSV,beloved by god that he has chosen you
7913,1TH,1,NRSV,because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake
7914,1TH,1,NRSV,and you became imitators of us and of the lord for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the holy spirit
7915,1TH,1,NRSV,so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia
7916,1TH,1,NRSV,for the word of the lord has sounded forth from you not only in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith in god has become known so that we have no need to speak about it
7917,1TH,1,NRSV,for the people of those regions
7918,1TH,1,NRSV,report about us what kind of welcome we had among you and how you turned to god from idols to serve a living and true god
7919,1TH,1,NRSV,and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the deadjesus who rescues us from the wrath that is coming
7920,1TH,2,NRSV,you yourselves know brothers and sisters
7921,1TH,2,NRSV,that our coming to you was not in vain
7922,1TH,2,NRSV,but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at philippi as you know we had courage in our god to declare to you the gospel of god in spite of great opposition
7923,1TH,2,NRSV,for our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery
7924,1TH,2,NRSV,but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the message of the gospel even so we speak not to please mortals but to please god who tests our hearts
7925,1TH,2,NRSV,as you know and as god is our witness we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed
7926,1TH,2,NRSV,nor did we seek praise from mortals whether from you or from others
7927,1TH,2,NRSV,though we might have made demands as apostles of christ but we were gentle
7928,1TH,2,NRSV,among you like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children
7929,1TH,2,NRSV,so deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own selves because you have become very dear to us
7930,1TH,2,NRSV,you remember our labor and toil brothers and sisters
7931,1TH,2,NRSV,we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of god
7932,1TH,2,NRSV,you are witnesses and god also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was toward you believers
7933,1TH,2,NRSV,as you know we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children
7934,1TH,2,NRSV,urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of god who calls you into his own kingdom and glory
7935,1TH,2,NRSV,we also constantly give thanks to god for this that when you received the word of god that you heard from us you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is gods word which is also at work in you believers
7936,1TH,2,NRSV,for you brothers and sisters
7937,1TH,2,NRSV,became imitators of the churches of god in christ jesus that are in judea for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the jews
7938,1TH,2,NRSV,who killed both the lord jesus and the prophets
7939,1TH,2,NRSV,and drove us out they displease god and oppose everyone
7940,1TH,2,NRSV,by hindering us from speaking to the gentiles so that they may be saved thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins but gods wrath has overtaken them at last
7941,1TH,2,NRSV,as for us brothers and sisters
7942,1TH,2,NRSV,when for a short time we were made orphans by being separated from youin person not in heartwe longed with great eagerness to see you face to face
7943,1TH,2,NRSV,for we wanted to come to youcertainly i paul wanted to again and againbut satan blocked our way
7944,1TH,2,NRSV,for what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our lord jesus at his coming is it not you
7945,1TH,2,NRSV,yes you are our glory and joy
7946,1TH,3,NRSV,therefore when we could bear it no longer we decided to be left alone in athens
7947,1TH,3,NRSV,and we sent timothy our brother and coworker for god in proclaiming
7948,1TH,3,NRSV,the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith
7949,1TH,3,NRSV,so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions indeed you yourselves know that this is what we are destined for
7950,1TH,3,NRSV,in fact when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution so it turned out as you know
7951,1TH,3,NRSV,for this reason when i could bear it no longer i sent to find out about your faith i was afraid that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor had been in vain
7952,1TH,3,NRSV,but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought us the good news of your faith and love he has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see usjust as we long to see you
7953,1TH,3,NRSV,for this reason brothers and sisters
7954,1TH,3,NRSV,during all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you through your faith
7955,1TH,3,NRSV,for we now live if you continue to stand firm in the lord
7956,1TH,3,NRSV,how can we thank god enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our god because of you
7957,1TH,3,NRSV,night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith
7958,1TH,3,NRSV,now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus direct our way to you
7959,1TH,3,NRSV,and may the lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all just as we abound in love for you
7960,1TH,3,NRSV,and may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints
7961,1TH,4,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters
7962,1TH,4,NRSV,we ask and urge you in the lord jesus that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please god as in fact you are doing you should do so more and more
7963,1TH,4,NRSV,for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus
7964,1TH,4,NRSV,for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from fornication
7965,1TH,4,NRSV,that each one of you know how to control your own body
7966,1TH,4,NRSV,in holiness and honor
7967,1TH,4,NRSV,not with lustful passion like the gentiles who do not know god
7968,1TH,4,NRSV,that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister
7969,1TH,4,NRSV,in this matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you
7970,1TH,4,NRSV,for god did not call us to impurity but in holiness
7971,1TH,4,NRSV,therefore whoever rejects this rejects not human authority but god who also gives his holy spirit to you
7972,1TH,4,NRSV,now concerning love of the brothers and sisters
7973,1TH,4,NRSV,you do not need to have anyone write to you for you yourselves have been taught by god to love one another
7974,1TH,4,NRSV,and indeed you do love all the brothers and sisters
7975,1TH,4,NRSV,throughout macedonia but we urge you beloved
7976,1TH,4,NRSV,to do so more and more
7977,1TH,4,NRSV,to aspire to live quietly to mind your own affairs and to work with your hands as we directed you
7978,1TH,4,NRSV,so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and be dependent on no one
7979,1TH,4,NRSV,but we do not want you to be uninformed brothers and sisters
7980,1TH,4,NRSV,about those who have died
7981,1TH,4,NRSV,so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope
7982,1TH,4,NRSV,for since we believe that jesus died and rose again even so through jesus god will bring with him those who have died
7983,1TH,4,NRSV,for this we declare to you by the word of the lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the lord will by no means precede those who have died
7984,1TH,4,NRSV,for the lord himself with a cry of command with the archangels call and with the sound of gods trumpet will descend from heaven and the dead in christ will rise first
7985,1TH,4,NRSV,then we who are alive who are left will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the lord in the air and so we will be with the lord forever
7986,1TH,4,NRSV,therefore encourage one another with these words
7987,1TH,5,NRSV,now concerning the times and the seasons brothers and sisters
7988,1TH,5,NRSV,you do not need to have anything written to you
7989,1TH,5,NRSV,for you yourselves know very well that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night
7990,1TH,5,NRSV,when they say there is peace and security then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman and there will be no escape
7991,1TH,5,NRSV,but you beloved
7992,1TH,5,NRSV,are not in darkness for that day to surprise you like a thief
7993,1TH,5,NRSV,for you are all children of light and children of the day we are not of the night or of darkness
7994,1TH,5,NRSV,so then let us not fall asleep as others do but let us keep awake and be sober
7995,1TH,5,NRSV,for those who sleep sleep at night and those who are drunk get drunk at night
7996,1TH,5,NRSV,but since we belong to the day let us be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation
7997,1TH,5,NRSV,for god has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our lord jesus christ
7998,1TH,5,NRSV,who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him
7999,1TH,5,NRSV,therefore encourage one another and build up each other as indeed you are doing
8000,1TH,5,NRSV,but we appeal to you brothers and sisters
8001,1TH,5,NRSV,to respect those who labor among you and have charge of you in the lord and admonish you
8002,1TH,5,NRSV,esteem them very highly in love because of their work be at peace among yourselves
8003,1TH,5,NRSV,and we urge you beloved
8004,1TH,5,NRSV,to admonish the idlers encourage the faint hearted help the weak be patient with all of them
8005,1TH,5,NRSV,see that none of you repays evil for evil but always seek to do good to one another and to all
8006,1TH,5,NRSV,rejoice always
8007,1TH,5,NRSV,pray without ceasing
8008,1TH,5,NRSV,give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you
8009,1TH,5,NRSV,do not quench the spirit
8010,1TH,5,NRSV,do not despise the words of prophets
8011,1TH,5,NRSV,but test everything hold fast to what is good
8012,1TH,5,NRSV,abstain from every form of evil
8013,1TH,5,NRSV,may the god of peace himself sanctify you entirely and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound
8014,1TH,5,NRSV,and blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ
8015,1TH,5,NRSV,the one who calls you is faithful and he will do this
8016,1TH,5,NRSV,beloved
8017,1TH,5,NRSV,pray for us
8018,1TH,5,NRSV,greet all the brothers and sisters
8019,1TH,5,NRSV,with a holy kiss
8020,1TH,5,NRSV,i solemnly command you by the lord that this letter be read to all of them
8021,1TH,5,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
8022,2TH,1,NRSV,paul silvanus and timothy
8023,2TH,1,NRSV,to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
8024,2TH,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our
8025,2TH,1,NRSV,father and the lord jesus christ
8026,2TH,1,NRSV,we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters
8027,2TH,1,NRSV,as is right because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing
8028,2TH,1,NRSV,therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of god for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring
8029,2TH,1,NRSV,this is evidence of the righteous judgment of god and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are also suffering
8030,2TH,1,NRSV,for it is indeed just of god to repay with affliction those who afflict you
8031,2TH,1,NRSV,and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
8032,2TH,1,NRSV,in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus
8033,2TH,1,NRSV,these will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction separated from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his might
8034,2TH,1,NRSV,when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at on that day among all who have believed because our testimony to you was believed
8035,2TH,1,NRSV,to this end we always pray for you asking that our god will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith
8036,2TH,1,NRSV,so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
8037,2TH,2,NRSV,as to the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we beg you brothers and sisters
8038,2TH,2,NRSV,not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by spirit or by word or by letter as though from us to the effect that the day of the lord is already here
8039,2TH,2,NRSV,let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one
8040,2TH,2,NRSV,is revealed the one destined for destruction
8041,2TH,2,NRSV,he opposes and exalts himself above every socalled god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god declaring himself to be god
8042,2TH,2,NRSV,do you not remember that i told you these things when i was still with you
8043,2TH,2,NRSV,and you know what is now restraining him so that he may be revealed when his time comes
8044,2TH,2,NRSV,for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work but only until the one who now restrains it is removed
8045,2TH,2,NRSV,and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus
8046,2TH,2,NRSV,will destroy
8047,2TH,2,NRSV,with the breath of his mouth annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming
8048,2TH,2,NRSV,the coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of satan who uses all power signs lying wonders
8049,2TH,2,NRSV,and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved
8050,2TH,2,NRSV,for this reason god sends them a powerful delusion leading them to believe what is false
8051,2TH,2,NRSV,so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned
8052,2TH,2,NRSV,but we must always give thanks to god for you brothers and sisters
8053,2TH,2,NRSV,beloved by the lord because god chose you as the first fruits
8054,2TH,2,NRSV,for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and through belief in the truth
8055,2TH,2,NRSV,for this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news
8056,2TH,2,NRSV,so that you may obtain the glory of our lord jesus christ
8057,2TH,2,NRSV,so then brothers and sisters
8058,2TH,2,NRSV,stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us either by word of mouth or by our letter
8059,2TH,2,NRSV,now may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope
8060,2TH,2,NRSV,comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word
8061,2TH,3,NRSV,finally brothers and sisters
8062,2TH,3,NRSV,pray for us so that the word of the lord may spread rapidly and be glorified everywhere just as it is among you
8063,2TH,3,NRSV,and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people for not all have faith
8064,2TH,3,NRSV,but the lord is faithful he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one
8065,2TH,3,NRSV,and we have confidence in the lord concerning you that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command
8066,2TH,3,NRSV,may the lord direct your hearts to the love of god and to the steadfastness of christ
8067,2TH,3,NRSV,now we command you beloved
8068,2TH,3,NRSV,in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from believers who are
8069,2TH,3,NRSV,living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they
8070,2TH,3,NRSV,received from us
8071,2TH,3,NRSV,for you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us we were not idle when we were with you
8072,2TH,3,NRSV,and we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but with toil and labor we worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you
8073,2TH,3,NRSV,this was not because we do not have that right but in order to give you an example to imitate
8074,2TH,3,NRSV,for even when we were with you we gave you this command anyone unwilling to work should not eat
8075,2TH,3,NRSV,for we hear that some of you are living in idleness mere busybodies not doing any work
8076,2TH,3,NRSV,now such persons we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living
8077,2TH,3,NRSV,brothers and sisters
8078,2TH,3,NRSV,do not be weary in doing what is right
8079,2TH,3,NRSV,take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter have nothing to do with them so that they may be ashamed
8080,2TH,3,NRSV,do not regard them as enemies but warn them as believers
8081,2TH,3,NRSV,now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways the lord be with all of you
8082,2TH,3,NRSV,i paul write this greeting with my own hand this is the mark in every letter of mine it is the way i write
8083,2TH,3,NRSV,the grace of our lord jesus christ be with all of you
8084,1TI,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our savior and of christ jesus our hope
8085,1TI,1,NRSV,to timothy my loyal child in the faith
8086,1TI,1,NRSV,grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
8087,1TI,1,NRSV,i urge you as i did when i was on my way to macedonia to remain in ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine
8088,1TI,1,NRSV,and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training
8089,1TI,1,NRSV,that is known by faith
8090,1TI,1,NRSV,but the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart a good conscience and sincere faith
8091,1TI,1,NRSV,some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk
8092,1TI,1,NRSV,desiring to be teachers of the law without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions
8093,1TI,1,NRSV,now we know that the law is good if one uses it legitimately
8094,1TI,1,NRSV,this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful for the unholy and profane for those who kill their father or mother for murderers
8095,1TI,1,NRSV,fornicators sodomites slave traders liars perjurers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching
8096,1TI,1,NRSV,that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me
8097,1TI,1,NRSV,i am grateful to christ jesus our lord who has strengthened me because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service
8098,1TI,1,NRSV,even though i was formerly a blasphemer a persecutor and a man of violence but i received mercy because i had acted ignorantly in unbelief
8099,1TI,1,NRSV,and the grace of our lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in christ jesus
8100,1TI,1,NRSV,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom i am the foremost
8101,1TI,1,NRSV,but for that very reason i received mercy so that in me as the foremost jesus christ might display the utmost patience making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life
8102,1TI,1,NRSV,to the king of the ages immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever
8103,1TI,1,NRSV,amen
8104,1TI,1,NRSV,i am giving you these instructions timothy my child in accordance with the prophecies made earlier about you so that by following them you may fight the good fight
8105,1TI,1,NRSV,having faith and a good conscience by rejecting conscience certain persons have suffered shipwreck in the faith
8106,1TI,1,NRSV,among them are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have turned over to satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme
8107,1TI,2,NRSV,first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone
8108,1TI,2,NRSV,for kings and all who are in high positions so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity
8109,1TI,2,NRSV,this is right and is acceptable in the sight of god our savior
8110,1TI,2,NRSV,who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
8111,1TI,2,NRSV,for
8112,1TI,2,NRSV,there is one god
8113,1TI,2,NRSV,there is also one mediator between god and humankind
8114,1TI,2,NRSV,christ jesus himself human
8115,1TI,2,NRSV,who gave himself a ransom for all
8116,1TI,2,NRSV,this was attested at the right time
8117,1TI,2,NRSV,for this i was appointed a herald and an apostle i am telling the truth
8118,1TI,2,NRSV,i am not lying a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth
8119,1TI,2,NRSV,i desire then that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger or argument
8120,1TI,2,NRSV,also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing not with their hair braided or with gold pearls or expensive clothes
8121,1TI,2,NRSV,but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for god
8122,1TI,2,NRSV,let a woman
8123,1TI,2,NRSV,learn in silence with full submission
8124,1TI,2,NRSV,i permit no woman
8125,1TI,2,NRSV,to teach or to have authority over a man
8126,1TI,2,NRSV,she is to keep silent
8127,1TI,2,NRSV,for adam was formed first then eve
8128,1TI,2,NRSV,and adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor
8129,1TI,2,NRSV,yet she will be saved through childbearing provided they continue in faith and love and holiness with modesty
8130,1TI,3,NRSV,the saying is sure
8131,1TI,3,NRSV,whoever aspires to the office of bishop
8132,1TI,3,NRSV,desires a noble task
8133,1TI,3,NRSV,now a bishop
8134,1TI,3,NRSV,must be above reproach married only once
8135,1TI,3,NRSV,temperate sensible respectable hospitable an apt teacher
8136,1TI,3,NRSV,not a drunkard not violent but gentle not quarrelsome and not a lover of money
8137,1TI,3,NRSV,he must manage his own household well keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way
8138,1TI,3,NRSV,for if someone does not know how to manage his own household how can he take care of gods church
8139,1TI,3,NRSV,he must not be a recent convert or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil
8140,1TI,3,NRSV,moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil
8141,1TI,3,NRSV,deacons likewise must be serious not doubletongued not indulging in much wine not greedy for money
8142,1TI,3,NRSV,they must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
8143,1TI,3,NRSV,and let them first be tested then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons
8144,1TI,3,NRSV,women
8145,1TI,3,NRSV,likewise must be serious not slanderers but temperate faithful in all things
8146,1TI,3,NRSV,let deacons be married only once
8147,1TI,3,NRSV,and let them manage their children and their households well
8148,1TI,3,NRSV,for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in christ jesus
8149,1TI,3,NRSV,i hope to come to you soon but i am writing these instructions to you so that
8150,1TI,3,NRSV,if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and bulwark of the truth
8151,1TI,3,NRSV,without any doubt the mystery of our religion is great
8152,1TI,3,NRSV,he
8153,1TI,3,NRSV,was revealed in flesh
8154,1TI,3,NRSV,vindicated
8155,1TI,3,NRSV,in spirit
8156,1TI,3,NRSV,seen by angels
8157,1TI,3,NRSV,proclaimed among gentiles
8158,1TI,3,NRSV,believed in throughout the world
8159,1TI,3,NRSV,taken up in glory
8160,1TI,4,NRSV,now the spirit expressly says that in later
8161,1TI,4,NRSV,times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons
8162,1TI,4,NRSV,through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron
8163,1TI,4,NRSV,they forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth
8164,1TI,4,NRSV,for everything created by god is good and nothing is to be rejected provided it is received with thanksgiving
8165,1TI,4,NRSV,for it is sanctified by gods word and by prayer
8166,1TI,4,NRSV,if you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters
8167,1TI,4,NRSV,you will be a good servant
8168,1TI,4,NRSV,of christ jesus nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed
8169,1TI,4,NRSV,have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives tales train yourself in godliness
8170,1TI,4,NRSV,for while physical training is of some value godliness is valuable in every way holding promise for both the present life and the life to come
8171,1TI,4,NRSV,the saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance
8172,1TI,4,NRSV,for to this end we toil and struggle
8173,1TI,4,NRSV,because we have our hope set on the living god who is the savior of all people especially of those who believe
8174,1TI,4,NRSV,these are the things you must insist on and teach
8175,1TI,4,NRSV,let no one despise your youth but set the believers an example in speech and conduct in love in faith in purity
8176,1TI,4,NRSV,until i arrive give attention to the public reading of scripture
8177,1TI,4,NRSV,to exhorting to teaching
8178,1TI,4,NRSV,do not neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders
8179,1TI,4,NRSV,put these things into practice devote yourself to them so that all may see your progress
8180,1TI,4,NRSV,pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching continue in these things for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers
8181,1TI,5,NRSV,do not speak harshly to an older man
8182,1TI,5,NRSV,but speak to him as to a father to younger men as brothers
8183,1TI,5,NRSV,to older women as mothers to younger women as sisterswith absolute purity
8184,1TI,5,NRSV,honor widows who are really widows
8185,1TI,5,NRSV,if a widow has children or grandchildren they should first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some repayment to their parents for this is pleasing in gods sight
8186,1TI,5,NRSV,the real widow left alone has set her hope on god and continues in supplications and prayers night and day
8187,1TI,5,NRSV,but the widow
8188,1TI,5,NRSV,who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives
8189,1TI,5,NRSV,give these commands as well so that they may be above reproach
8190,1TI,5,NRSV,and whoever does not provide for relatives and especially for family members has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
8191,1TI,5,NRSV,let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once
8192,1TI,5,NRSV,she must be well attested for her good works as one who has brought up children shown hospitality washed the saints feet helped the afflicted and devoted herself to doing good in every way
8193,1TI,5,NRSV,but refuse to put younger widows on the list for when their sensual desires alienate them from christ they want to marry
8194,1TI,5,NRSV,and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge
8195,1TI,5,NRSV,besides that they learn to be idle gadding about from house to house and they are not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say
8196,1TI,5,NRSV,so i would have younger widows marry bear children and manage their households so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us
8197,1TI,5,NRSV,for some have already turned away to follow satan
8198,1TI,5,NRSV,if any believing woman
8199,1TI,5,NRSV,has relatives who are really widows let her assist them let the church not be burdened so that it can assist those who are real widows
8200,1TI,5,NRSV,let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor
8201,1TI,5,NRSV,especially those who labor in preaching and teaching
8202,1TI,5,NRSV,for the scripture says you shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain and the laborer deserves to be paid
8203,1TI,5,NRSV,never accept any accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses
8204,1TI,5,NRSV,as for those who persist in sin rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest also may stand in fear
8205,1TI,5,NRSV,in the presence of god and of christ jesus and of the elect angels i warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice doing nothing on the basis of partiality
8206,1TI,5,NRSV,do not ordain
8207,1TI,5,NRSV,anyone hastily and do not participate in the sins of others keep yourself pure
8208,1TI,5,NRSV,no longer drink only water but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments
8209,1TI,5,NRSV,the sins of some people are conspicuous and precede them to judgment while the sins of others follow them there
8210,1TI,5,NRSV,so also good works are conspicuous and even when they are not they cannot remain hidden
8211,1TI,6,NRSV,let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of god and the teaching may not be blasphemed
8212,1TI,6,NRSV,those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church
8213,1TI,6,NRSV,rather they must serve them all the more since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved
8214,1TI,6,NRSV,teach and urge these duties
8215,1TI,6,NRSV,whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our lord jesus christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness
8216,1TI,6,NRSV,is conceited understanding nothing and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words from these come envy dissension slander base suspicions
8217,1TI,6,NRSV,and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain
8218,1TI,6,NRSV,of course there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment
8219,1TI,6,NRSV,for we brought nothing into the world so that
8220,1TI,6,NRSV,we can take nothing out of it
8221,1TI,6,NRSV,but if we have food and clothing we will be content with these
8222,1TI,6,NRSV,but those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction
8223,1TI,6,NRSV,for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains
8224,1TI,6,NRSV,but as for you man of god shun all this pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance gentleness
8225,1TI,6,NRSV,fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made
8226,1TI,6,NRSV,the good confession in the presence of many witnesses
8227,1TI,6,NRSV,in the presence of god who gives life to all things and of christ jesus who in his testimony before pontius pilate made the good confession i charge you
8228,1TI,6,NRSV,to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ
8229,1TI,6,NRSV,which he will bring about at the right timehe who is the blessed and only sovereign the king of kings and lord of lords
8230,1TI,6,NRSV,it is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no one has ever seen or can see to him be honor and eternal dominion amen
8231,1TI,6,NRSV,as for those who in the present age are rich command them not to be haughty or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but rather on god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment
8232,1TI,6,NRSV,they are to do good to be rich in good works generous and ready to share
8233,1TI,6,NRSV,thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of the life that really is life
8234,1TI,6,NRSV,timothy guard what has been entrusted to you avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge
8235,1TI,6,NRSV,by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith
8236,1TI,6,NRSV,grace be with you
8237,2TI,1,NRSV,paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god for the sake of the promise of life that is in christ jesus
8238,2TI,1,NRSV,to timothy my beloved child
8239,2TI,1,NRSV,grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
8240,2TI,1,NRSV,i am grateful to godwhom i worship with a clear conscience as my ancestors didwhen i remember you constantly in my prayers night and day
8241,2TI,1,NRSV,recalling your tears i long to see you so that i may be filled with joy
8242,2TI,1,NRSV,i am reminded of your sincere faith a faith that lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and now i am sure lives in you
8243,2TI,1,NRSV,for this reason i remind you to rekindle the gift of god that is within you through the laying on of my hands
8244,2TI,1,NRSV,for god did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather a spirit of power and of love and of selfdiscipline
8245,2TI,1,NRSV,do not be ashamed then of the testimony about our lord or of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel relying on the power of god
8246,2TI,1,NRSV,who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace this grace was given to us in christ jesus before the ages began
8247,2TI,1,NRSV,but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our savior christ jesus who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
8248,2TI,1,NRSV,for this gospel i was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher
8249,2TI,1,NRSV,and for this reason i suffer as i do but i am not ashamed for i know the one in whom i have put my trust and i am sure that he is able to guard until that day what i have entrusted to him
8250,2TI,1,NRSV,hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me in the faith and love that are in christ jesus
8251,2TI,1,NRSV,guard the good treasure entrusted to you with the help of the holy spirit living in us
8252,2TI,1,NRSV,you are aware that all who are in asia have turned away from me including phygelus and hermogenes
8253,2TI,1,NRSV,may the lord grant mercy to the household of onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain
8254,2TI,1,NRSV,when he arrived in rome he eagerly
8255,2TI,1,NRSV,searched for me and found me
8256,2TI,1,NRSV,may the lord grant that he will find mercy from the lord on that day and you know very well how much service he rendered in ephesus
8257,2TI,2,NRSV,you then my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus
8258,2TI,2,NRSV,and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well
8259,2TI,2,NRSV,share in suffering like a good soldier of christ jesus
8260,2TI,2,NRSV,no one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs the soldiers aim is to please the enlisting officer
8261,2TI,2,NRSV,and in the case of an athlete no one is crowned without competing according to the rules
8262,2TI,2,NRSV,it is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of the crops
8263,2TI,2,NRSV,think over what i say for the lord will give you understanding in all things
8264,2TI,2,NRSV,remember jesus christ raised from the dead a descendant of davidthat is my gospel
8265,2TI,2,NRSV,for which i suffer hardship even to the point of being chained like a criminal but the word of god is not chained
8266,2TI,2,NRSV,therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory
8267,2TI,2,NRSV,the saying is sure
8268,2TI,2,NRSV,if we have died with him we will also live with him
8269,2TI,2,NRSV,if we endure we will also reign with him
8270,2TI,2,NRSV,if we deny him he will also deny us
8271,2TI,2,NRSV,if we are faithless he remains faithful
8272,2TI,2,NRSV,for he cannot deny himself
8273,2TI,2,NRSV,remind them of this and warn them before god
8274,2TI,2,NRSV,that they are to avoid wrangling over words which does no good but only ruins those who are listening
8275,2TI,2,NRSV,do your best to present yourself to god as one approved by him a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly explaining the word of truth
8276,2TI,2,NRSV,avoid profane chatter for it will lead people into more and more impiety
8277,2TI,2,NRSV,and their talk will spread like gangrene among them are hymenaeus and philetus
8278,2TI,2,NRSV,who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place they are upsetting the faith of some
8279,2TI,2,NRSV,but gods firm foundation stands bearing this inscription the lord knows those who are his and let everyone who calls on the name of the lord turn away from wickedness
8280,2TI,2,NRSV,in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay some for special use some for ordinary
8281,2TI,2,NRSV,all who cleanse themselves of the things i have mentioned
8282,2TI,2,NRSV,will become special utensils dedicated and useful to the owner of the house ready for every good work
8283,2TI,2,NRSV,shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord from a pure heart
8284,2TI,2,NRSV,have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies you know that they breed quarrels
8285,2TI,2,NRSV,and the lords servant
8286,2TI,2,NRSV,must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone an apt teacher patient
8287,2TI,2,NRSV,correcting opponents with gentleness god may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth
8288,2TI,2,NRSV,and that they may escape from the snare of the devil having been held captive by him to do his will
8289,2TI,3,NRSV,you must understand this that in the last days distressing times will come
8290,2TI,3,NRSV,for people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boasters arrogant abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy
8291,2TI,3,NRSV,inhuman implacable slanderers profligates brutes haters of good
8292,2TI,3,NRSV,treacherous reckless swollen with conceit lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god
8293,2TI,3,NRSV,holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power avoid them
8294,2TI,3,NRSV,for among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires
8295,2TI,3,NRSV,who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth
8296,2TI,3,NRSV,as jannes and jambres opposed moses so these people of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith also oppose the truth
8297,2TI,3,NRSV,but they will not make much progress because as in the case of those two men
8298,2TI,3,NRSV,their folly will become plain to everyone
8299,2TI,3,NRSV,now you have observed my teaching my conduct my aim in life my faith my patience my love my steadfastness
8300,2TI,3,NRSV,my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in antioch iconium and lystra what persecutions i endured yet the lord rescued me from all of them
8301,2TI,3,NRSV,indeed all who want to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted
8302,2TI,3,NRSV,but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving others and being deceived
8303,2TI,3,NRSV,but as for you continue in what you have learned and firmly believed knowing from whom you learned it
8304,2TI,3,NRSV,and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in christ jesus
8305,2TI,3,NRSV,all scripture is inspired by god and is
8306,2TI,3,NRSV,useful for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness
8307,2TI,3,NRSV,so that everyone who belongs to god may be proficient equipped for every good work
8308,2TI,4,NRSV,in the presence of god and of christ jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom i solemnly urge you
8309,2TI,4,NRSV,proclaim the message be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable convince rebuke and encourage with the utmost patience in teaching
8310,2TI,4,NRSV,for the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires
8311,2TI,4,NRSV,and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths
8312,2TI,4,NRSV,as for you always be sober endure suffering do the work of an evangelist carry out your ministry fully
8313,2TI,4,NRSV,as for me i am already being poured out as a libation and the time of my departure has come
8314,2TI,4,NRSV,i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
8315,2TI,4,NRSV,from now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing
8316,2TI,4,NRSV,do your best to come to me soon
8317,2TI,4,NRSV,for demas in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia
8318,2TI,4,NRSV,titus to dalmatia
8319,2TI,4,NRSV,only luke is with me get mark and bring him with you for he is useful in my ministry
8320,2TI,4,NRSV,i have sent tychicus to ephesus
8321,2TI,4,NRSV,when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas also the books and above all the parchments
8322,2TI,4,NRSV,alexander the coppersmith did me great harm the lord will pay him back for his deeds
8323,2TI,4,NRSV,you also must beware of him for he strongly opposed our message
8324,2TI,4,NRSV,at my first defense no one came to my support but all deserted me may it not be counted against them
8325,2TI,4,NRSV,but the lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the gentiles might hear it so i was rescued from the lions mouth
8326,2TI,4,NRSV,the lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom to him be the glory forever and ever amen

8330,2TI,4,NRSV,the lord be with your spirit grace be with you
8331,TIT,1,NRSV,paul a servant
8332,TIT,1,NRSV,of god and an apostle of jesus christ for the sake of the faith of gods elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness
8333,TIT,1,NRSV,in the hope of eternal life that god who never lies promised before the ages began
8334,TIT,1,NRSV,in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which i have been entrusted by the command of god our savior
8335,TIT,1,NRSV,to titus my loyal child in the faith we share
8336,TIT,1,NRSV,grace
8337,TIT,1,NRSV,and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior
8338,TIT,1,NRSV,i left you behind in crete for this reason so that you should put in order what remained to be done and should appoint elders in every town as i directed you
8339,TIT,1,NRSV,someone who is blameless married only once
8340,TIT,1,NRSV,whose children are believers not accused of debauchery and not rebellious
8341,TIT,1,NRSV,for a bishop
8342,TIT,1,NRSV,as gods steward must be blameless he must not be arrogant or quicktempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain
8343,TIT,1,NRSV,but he must be hospitable a lover of goodness prudent upright devout and selfcontrolled
8344,TIT,1,NRSV,he must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it
8345,TIT,1,NRSV,there are also many rebellious people idle talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision
8346,TIT,1,NRSV,they must be silenced since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach
8347,TIT,1,NRSV,it was one of them their very own prophet who said
8348,TIT,1,NRSV,cretans are always liars vicious brutes lazy gluttons
8349,TIT,1,NRSV,that testimony is true for this reason rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith
8350,TIT,1,NRSV,not paying attention to jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth
8351,TIT,1,NRSV,to the pure all things are pure but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure their very minds and consciences are corrupted
8352,TIT,1,NRSV,they profess to know god but they deny him by their actions they are detestable disobedient unfit for any good work
8353,TIT,2,NRSV,but as for you teach what is consistent with sound doctrine
8354,TIT,2,NRSV,tell the older men to be temperate serious prudent and sound in faith in love and in endurance
8355,TIT,2,NRSV,likewise tell the older women to be reverent in behavior not to be slanderers or slaves to drink they are to teach what is good
8356,TIT,2,NRSV,so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children
8357,TIT,2,NRSV,to be selfcontrolled chaste good managers of the household kind being submissive to their husbands so that the word of god may not be discredited
8358,TIT,2,NRSV,likewise urge the younger men to be selfcontrolled
8359,TIT,2,NRSV,show yourself in all respects a model of good works and in your teaching show integrity gravity
8360,TIT,2,NRSV,and sound speech that cannot be censured then any opponent will be put to shame having nothing evil to say of us
8361,TIT,2,NRSV,tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect they are not to talk back
8362,TIT,2,NRSV,not to pilfer but to show complete and perfect fidelity so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of god our savior
8363,TIT,2,NRSV,for the grace of god has appeared bringing salvation to all
8364,TIT,2,NRSV,training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions and in the present age to live lives that are selfcontrolled upright and godly
8365,TIT,2,NRSV,while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great god and savior
8366,TIT,2,NRSV,jesus christ
8367,TIT,2,NRSV,he it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds
8368,TIT,2,NRSV,declare these things exhort and reprove with all authority
8369,TIT,2,NRSV,let no one look down on you
8370,TIT,3,NRSV,remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready for every good work
8371,TIT,3,NRSV,to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show every courtesy to everyone
8372,TIT,3,NRSV,for we ourselves were once foolish disobedient led astray slaves to various passions and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy despicable hating one another
8373,TIT,3,NRSV,but when the goodness and loving kindness of god our savior appeared
8374,TIT,3,NRSV,he saved us not because of any works of righteousness that we had done but according to his mercy through the water
8375,TIT,3,NRSV,of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit
8376,TIT,3,NRSV,this spirit he poured out on us richly through jesus christ our savior
8377,TIT,3,NRSV,so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life
8378,TIT,3,NRSV,the saying is sure
8379,TIT,3,NRSV,i desire that you insist on these things so that those who have come to believe in god may be careful to devote themselves to good works these things are excellent and profitable to everyone
8380,TIT,3,NRSV,but avoid stupid controversies genealogies dissensions and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable and worthless
8381,TIT,3,NRSV,after a first and second admonition have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions
8382,TIT,3,NRSV,since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful being selfcondemned
8383,TIT,3,NRSV,when i send artemas to you or tychicus do your best to come to me at nicopolis for i have decided to spend the winter there
8384,TIT,3,NRSV,make every effort to send zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way and see that they lack nothing
8385,TIT,3,NRSV,and let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs so that they may not be unproductive
8386,TIT,3,NRSV,all who are with me send greetings to you greet those who love us in the faith
8387,TIT,3,NRSV,grace be with all of you
8388,PHM,1,NRSV,paul a prisoner of christ jesus and timothy our brother
8389,PHM,1,NRSV,to philemon our dear friend and coworker
8390,PHM,1,NRSV,to apphia our sister
8391,PHM,1,NRSV,to archippus our fellow soldier and to the church in your house
8392,PHM,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
8393,PHM,1,NRSV,when i remember you
8394,PHM,1,NRSV,in my prayers i always thank my god
8395,PHM,1,NRSV,because i hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the lord jesus
8396,PHM,1,NRSV,i pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we
8397,PHM,1,NRSV,may do for christ
8398,PHM,1,NRSV,i have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you my brother
8399,PHM,1,NRSV,for this reason though i am bold enough in christ to command you to do your duty
8400,PHM,1,NRSV,yet i would rather appeal to you on the basis of loveand i paul do this as an old man and now also as a prisoner of christ jesus
8401,PHM,1,NRSV,i am appealing to you for my child onesimus whose father i have become during my imprisonment
8402,PHM,1,NRSV,formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful
8403,PHM,1,NRSV,both to you and to me
8404,PHM,1,NRSV,i am sending him that is my own heart back to you
8405,PHM,1,NRSV,i wanted to keep him with me so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel
8406,PHM,1,NRSV,but i preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced
8407,PHM,1,NRSV,perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever
8408,PHM,1,NRSV,no longer as a slave but more than a slave a beloved brotherespecially to me but how much more to you both in the flesh and in the lord
8409,PHM,1,NRSV,so if you consider me your partner welcome him as you would welcome me
8410,PHM,1,NRSV,if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account
8411,PHM,1,NRSV,i paul am writing this with my own hand i will repay it i say nothing about your owing me even your own self
8412,PHM,1,NRSV,yes brother let me have this benefit from you in the lord refresh my heart in christ
8413,PHM,1,NRSV,confident of your obedience i am writing to you knowing that you will do even more than i say
8414,PHM,1,NRSV,one thing moreprepare a guest room for me for i am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you
8415,PHM,1,NRSV,epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus sends greetings to you
8416,PHM,1,NRSV,and so do mark aristarchus demas and luke my fellow workers
8417,PHM,1,NRSV,the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit
8418,HEB,1,NRSV,long ago god spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets
8419,HEB,1,NRSV,but in these last days he has spoken to us by a son
8420,HEB,1,NRSV,whom he appointed heir of all things through whom he also created the worlds
8421,HEB,1,NRSV,he is the reflection of gods glory and the exact imprint of gods very being and he sustains
8422,HEB,1,NRSV,all things by his powerful word when he had made purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high
8423,HEB,1,NRSV,having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs
8424,HEB,1,NRSV,for to which of the angels did god ever say
8425,HEB,1,NRSV,you are my son
8426,HEB,1,NRSV,today i have begotten you
8427,HEB,1,NRSV,or again
8428,HEB,1,NRSV,i will be his father
8429,HEB,1,NRSV,and he will be my son
8430,HEB,1,NRSV,and again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says
8431,HEB,1,NRSV,let all gods angels worship him
8432,HEB,1,NRSV,of the angels he says
8433,HEB,1,NRSV,he makes his angels winds
8434,HEB,1,NRSV,and his servants flames of fire
8435,HEB,1,NRSV,but of the son he says
8436,HEB,1,NRSV,your throne o god
8437,HEB,1,NRSV,is forever and ever
8438,HEB,1,NRSV,and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your
8439,HEB,1,NRSV,kingdom
8440,HEB,1,NRSV,you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness
8441,HEB,1,NRSV,therefore god your god has anointed you
8442,HEB,1,NRSV,with the oil of gladness beyond your companions
8443,HEB,1,NRSV,and
8444,HEB,1,NRSV,in the beginning lord you founded the earth
8445,HEB,1,NRSV,and the heavens are the work of your hands
8446,HEB,1,NRSV,they will perish but you remain
8447,HEB,1,NRSV,they will all wear out like clothing
8448,HEB,1,NRSV,like a cloak you will roll them up
8449,HEB,1,NRSV,and like clothing
8450,HEB,1,NRSV,they will be changed
8451,HEB,1,NRSV,but you are the same
8452,HEB,1,NRSV,and your years will never end
8453,HEB,1,NRSV,but to which of the angels has he ever said
8454,HEB,1,NRSV,sit at my right hand
8455,HEB,1,NRSV,until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet
8456,HEB,1,NRSV,are not all angels
8457,HEB,1,NRSV,spirits in the divine service sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation
8458,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it
8459,HEB,2,NRSV,for if the message declared through angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty
8460,HEB,2,NRSV,how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation it was declared at first through the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard him
8461,HEB,2,NRSV,while god added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will
8462,HEB,2,NRSV,now god
8463,HEB,2,NRSV,did not subject the coming world about which we are speaking to angels
8464,HEB,2,NRSV,but someone has testified somewhere
8465,HEB,2,NRSV,what are human beings that you are mindful of them
8466,HEB,2,NRSV,or mortals that you care for them
8467,HEB,2,NRSV,you have made them for a little while lower
8468,HEB,2,NRSV,than the angels
8469,HEB,2,NRSV,you have crowned them with glory and honor
8470,HEB,2,NRSV,subjecting all things under their feet
8471,HEB,2,NRSV,now in subjecting all things to them god
8472,HEB,2,NRSV,left nothing outside their control as it is we do not yet see everything in subjection to them
8473,HEB,2,NRSV,but we do see jesus who for a little while was made lower
8474,HEB,2,NRSV,than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of god
8475,HEB,2,NRSV,he might taste death for everyone
8476,HEB,2,NRSV,it was fitting that god
8477,HEB,2,NRSV,for whom and through whom all things exist in bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings
8478,HEB,2,NRSV,for the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one father
8479,HEB,2,NRSV,for this reason jesus
8480,HEB,2,NRSV,is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters
8481,HEB,2,NRSV,saying
8482,HEB,2,NRSV,i will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters
8483,HEB,2,NRSV,in the midst of the congregation i will praise you
8484,HEB,2,NRSV,and again
8485,HEB,2,NRSV,i will put my trust in him
8486,HEB,2,NRSV,and again
8487,HEB,2,NRSV,here am i and the children whom god has given me
8488,HEB,2,NRSV,since therefore the children share flesh and blood he himself likewise shared the same things so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil
8489,HEB,2,NRSV,and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death
8490,HEB,2,NRSV,for it is clear that he did not come to help angels but the descendants of abraham
8491,HEB,2,NRSV,therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters
8492,HEB,2,NRSV,in every respect so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of god to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people
8493,HEB,2,NRSV,because he himself was tested by what he suffered he is able to help those who are being tested
8494,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore brothers and sisters
8495,HEB,3,NRSV,holy partners in a heavenly calling consider that jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession
8496,HEB,3,NRSV,was faithful to the one who appointed him just as moses also was faithful in all
8497,HEB,3,NRSV,gods
8498,HEB,3,NRSV,house
8499,HEB,3,NRSV,yet jesus
8500,HEB,3,NRSV,is worthy of more glory than moses just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself
8501,HEB,3,NRSV,for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god
8502,HEB,3,NRSV,now moses was faithful in all gods
8503,HEB,3,NRSV,house as a servant to testify to the things that would be spoken later
8504,HEB,3,NRSV,christ however was faithful over gods
8505,HEB,3,NRSV,house as a son and we are his house if we hold firm
8506,HEB,3,NRSV,the confidence and the pride that belong to hope
8507,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore as the holy spirit says
8508,HEB,3,NRSV,today if you hear his voice
8509,HEB,3,NRSV,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion
8510,HEB,3,NRSV,as on the day of testing in the wilderness
8511,HEB,3,NRSV,where your ancestors put me to the test
8512,HEB,3,NRSV,though they had seen my works
8513,HEB,3,NRSV,for forty years
8514,HEB,3,NRSV,therefore i was angry with that generation
8515,HEB,3,NRSV,and i said they always go astray in their hearts
8516,HEB,3,NRSV,and they have not known my ways
8517,HEB,3,NRSV,as in my anger i swore
8518,HEB,3,NRSV,they will not enter my rest
8519,HEB,3,NRSV,take care brothers and sisters
8520,HEB,3,NRSV,that none of you may have an evil unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god
8521,HEB,3,NRSV,but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin
8522,HEB,3,NRSV,for we have become partners of christ if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end
8523,HEB,3,NRSV,as it is said
8524,HEB,3,NRSV,today if you hear his voice
8525,HEB,3,NRSV,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion
8526,HEB,3,NRSV,now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious was it not all those who left egypt under the leadership of moses
8527,HEB,3,NRSV,but with whom was he angry forty years was it not those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness
8528,HEB,3,NRSV,and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if not to those who were disobedient
8529,HEB,3,NRSV,so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief
8530,HEB,4,NRSV,therefore while the promise of entering his rest is still open let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it
8531,HEB,4,NRSV,for indeed the good news came to us just as to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened
8532,HEB,4,NRSV,for we who have believed enter that rest just as god
8533,HEB,4,NRSV,has said
8534,HEB,4,NRSV,as in my anger i swore
8535,HEB,4,NRSV,they shall not enter my rest
8536,HEB,4,NRSV,though his works were finished at the foundation of the world
8537,HEB,4,NRSV,for in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows and god rested on the seventh day from all his works
8538,HEB,4,NRSV,and again in this place it says they shall not enter my rest
8539,HEB,4,NRSV,since therefore it remains open for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience
8540,HEB,4,NRSV,again he sets a certain daytodaysaying through david much later in the words already quoted
8541,HEB,4,NRSV,today if you hear his voice
8542,HEB,4,NRSV,do not harden your hearts
8543,HEB,4,NRSV,for if joshua had given them rest god
8544,HEB,4,NRSV,would not speak later about another day
8545,HEB,4,NRSV,so then a sabbath rest still remains for the people of god
8546,HEB,4,NRSV,for those who enter gods rest also cease from their labors as god did from his
8547,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs
8548,HEB,4,NRSV,indeed the word of god is living and active sharper than any twoedged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart
8549,HEB,4,NRSV,and before him no creature is hidden but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account
8550,HEB,4,NRSV,since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our confession
8551,HEB,4,NRSV,for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who in every respect has been tested
8552,HEB,4,NRSV,as we are yet without sin
8553,HEB,4,NRSV,let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need
8554,HEB,5,NRSV,every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to god on their behalf to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins
8555,HEB,5,NRSV,he is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is subject to weakness
8556,HEB,5,NRSV,and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people
8557,HEB,5,NRSV,and one does not presume to take this honor but takes it only when called by god just as aaron was
8558,HEB,5,NRSV,so also christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him
8559,HEB,5,NRSV,you are my son
8560,HEB,5,NRSV,today i have begotten you
8561,HEB,5,NRSV,as he says also in another place
8562,HEB,5,NRSV,you are a priest forever
8563,HEB,5,NRSV,according to the order of melchizedek
8564,HEB,5,NRSV,in the days of his flesh jesus
8565,HEB,5,NRSV,offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission
8566,HEB,5,NRSV,although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered
8567,HEB,5,NRSV,and having been made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
8568,HEB,5,NRSV,having been designated by god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek
8569,HEB,5,NRSV,about this
8570,HEB,5,NRSV,we have much to say that is hard to explain since you have become dull in understanding
8571,HEB,5,NRSV,for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of god you need milk not solid food
8572,HEB,5,NRSV,for everyone who lives on milk being still an infant is unskilled in the word of righteousness
8573,HEB,5,NRSV,but solid food is for the mature for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil
8574,HEB,6,NRSV,therefore let us go on toward perfection
8575,HEB,6,NRSV,leaving behind the basic teaching about christ and not laying again the foundation repentance from dead works and faith toward god
8576,HEB,6,NRSV,instruction about baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment
8577,HEB,6,NRSV,and we will do
8578,HEB,6,NRSV,this if god permits
8579,HEB,6,NRSV,for it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the holy spirit
8580,HEB,6,NRSV,and have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the age to come
8581,HEB,6,NRSV,and then have fallen away since on their own they are crucifying again the son of god and are holding him up to contempt
8582,HEB,6,NRSV,ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from god
8583,HEB,6,NRSV,but if it produces thorns and thistles it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed its end is to be burned over
8584,HEB,6,NRSV,even though we speak in this way beloved we are confident of better things in your case things that belong to salvation
8585,HEB,6,NRSV,for god is not unjust he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake
8586,HEB,6,NRSV,in serving the saints as you still do
8587,HEB,6,NRSV,and we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end
8588,HEB,6,NRSV,so that you may not become sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises
8589,HEB,6,NRSV,when god made a promise to abraham because he had no one greater by whom to swear he swore by himself
8590,HEB,6,NRSV,saying i will surely bless you and multiply you
8591,HEB,6,NRSV,and thus abraham
8592,HEB,6,NRSV,having patiently endured obtained the promise
8593,HEB,6,NRSV,human beings of course swear by someone greater than themselves and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute
8594,HEB,6,NRSV,in the same way when god desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose he guaranteed it by an oath
8595,HEB,6,NRSV,so that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible that god would prove false we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us
8596,HEB,6,NRSV,we have this hope a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain
8597,HEB,6,NRSV,where jesus a forerunner on our behalf has entered having become a high priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
8598,HEB,7,NRSV,this king melchizedek of salem priest of the most high god met abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him
8599,HEB,7,NRSV,and to him abraham apportioned onetenth of everything his name in the first place means king of righteousness next he is also king of salem that is king of peace
8600,HEB,7,NRSV,without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever
8601,HEB,7,NRSV,see how great he is even
8602,HEB,7,NRSV,abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils
8603,HEB,7,NRSV,and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes
8604,HEB,7,NRSV,from the people that is from their kindred
8605,HEB,7,NRSV,though these also are descended from abraham
8606,HEB,7,NRSV,but this man who does not belong to their ancestry collected tithes
8607,HEB,7,NRSV,from abraham and blessed him who had received the promises
8608,HEB,7,NRSV,it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior
8609,HEB,7,NRSV,in the one case tithes are received by those who are mortal in the other by one of whom it is testified that he lives
8610,HEB,7,NRSV,one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham
8611,HEB,7,NRSV,for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him
8612,HEB,7,NRSV,now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthoodfor the people received the law under this priesthoodwhat further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of melchizedek rather than one according to the order of aaron
8613,HEB,7,NRSV,for when there is a change in the priesthood there is necessarily a change in the law as well
8614,HEB,7,NRSV,now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar
8615,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is evident that our lord was descended from judah and in connection with that tribe moses said nothing about priests
8616,HEB,7,NRSV,it is even more obvious when another priest arises resembling melchizedek
8617,HEB,7,NRSV,one who has become a priest not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life
8618,HEB,7,NRSV,for it is attested of him
8619,HEB,7,NRSV,you are a priest forever
8620,HEB,7,NRSV,according to the order of melchizedek
8621,HEB,7,NRSV,there is on the one hand the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual
8622,HEB,7,NRSV,for the law made nothing perfect there is on the other hand the introduction of a better hope through which we approach god
8623,HEB,7,NRSV,this was confirmed with an oath for others who became priests took their office without an oath
8624,HEB,7,NRSV,but this one became a priest with an oath because of the one who said to him
8625,HEB,7,NRSV,the lord has sworn
8626,HEB,7,NRSV,and will not change his mind
8627,HEB,7,NRSV,you are a priest forever
8628,HEB,7,NRSV,accordingly jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant
8629,HEB,7,NRSV,furthermore the former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office
8630,HEB,7,NRSV,but he holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever
8631,HEB,7,NRSV,consequently he is able for all time to save
8632,HEB,7,NRSV,those who approach god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them
8633,HEB,7,NRSV,for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy blameless undefiled separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens
8634,HEB,7,NRSV,unlike the other
8635,HEB,7,NRSV,high priests he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for those of the people this he did once for all when he offered himself
8636,HEB,7,NRSV,for the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness but the word of the oath which came later than the law appoints a son who has been made perfect forever
8637,HEB,8,NRSV,now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens
8638,HEB,8,NRSV,a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent
8639,HEB,8,NRSV,that the lord and not any mortal has set up
8640,HEB,8,NRSV,for every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer
8641,HEB,8,NRSV,now if he were on earth he would not be a priest at all since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law
8642,HEB,8,NRSV,they offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent
8643,HEB,8,NRSV,was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain
8644,HEB,8,NRSV,but jesus
8645,HEB,8,NRSV,has now obtained a more excellent ministry and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted through better promises
8646,HEB,8,NRSV,for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no need to look for a second one
8647,HEB,8,NRSV,god
8648,HEB,8,NRSV,finds fault with them when he says
8649,HEB,8,NRSV,the days are surely coming says the lord
8650,HEB,8,NRSV,when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel
8651,HEB,8,NRSV,and with the house of judah
8652,HEB,8,NRSV,not like the covenant that i made with their ancestors
8653,HEB,8,NRSV,on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt
8654,HEB,8,NRSV,for they did not continue in my covenant
8655,HEB,8,NRSV,and so i had no concern for them says the lord
8656,HEB,8,NRSV,this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel
8657,HEB,8,NRSV,after those days says the lord
8658,HEB,8,NRSV,i will put my laws in their minds
8659,HEB,8,NRSV,and write them on their hearts
8660,HEB,8,NRSV,and i will be their god
8661,HEB,8,NRSV,and they shall be my people
8662,HEB,8,NRSV,and they shall not teach one another
8663,HEB,8,NRSV,or say to each other know the lord
8664,HEB,8,NRSV,for they shall all know me
8665,HEB,8,NRSV,from the least of them to the greatest
8666,HEB,8,NRSV,for i will be merciful toward their iniquities
8667,HEB,8,NRSV,and i will remember their sins no more
8668,HEB,8,NRSV,in speaking of a new covenant he has made the first one obsolete and what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear
8669,HEB,9,NRSV,now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary
8670,HEB,9,NRSV,for a tent
8671,HEB,9,NRSV,was constructed the first one in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence
8672,HEB,9,NRSV,this is called the holy place
8673,HEB,9,NRSV,behind the second curtain was a tent
8674,HEB,9,NRSV,called the holy of holies
8675,HEB,9,NRSV,in it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold in which there were a golden urn holding the manna and aarons rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant
8676,HEB,9,NRSV,above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat
8677,HEB,9,NRSV,of these things we cannot speak now in detail
8678,HEB,9,NRSV,such preparations having been made the priests go continually into the first tent
8679,HEB,9,NRSV,to carry out their ritual duties
8680,HEB,9,NRSV,but only the high priest goes into the second and he but once a year and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people
8681,HEB,9,NRSV,by this the holy spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent
8682,HEB,9,NRSV,is still standing
8683,HEB,9,NRSV,this is a symbol
8684,HEB,9,NRSV,of the present time during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper
8685,HEB,9,NRSV,but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right
8686,HEB,9,NRSV,but when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come
8687,HEB,9,NRSV,then through the greater and perfect
8688,HEB,9,NRSV,tent
8689,HEB,9,NRSV,not made with hands that is not of this creation
8690,HEB,9,NRSV,he entered once for all into the holy place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption
8691,HEB,9,NRSV,for if the blood of goats and bulls with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified
8692,HEB,9,NRSV,how much more will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit
8693,HEB,9,NRSV,offered himself without blemish to god purify our
8694,HEB,9,NRSV,conscience from dead works to worship the living god
8695,HEB,9,NRSV,for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant
8696,HEB,9,NRSV,where a will
8697,HEB,9,NRSV,is involved the death of the one who made it must be established
8698,HEB,9,NRSV,for a will
8699,HEB,9,NRSV,takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive
8700,HEB,9,NRSV,hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood
8701,HEB,9,NRSV,for when every commandment had been told to all the people by moses in accordance with the law he took the blood of calves and goats
8702,HEB,9,NRSV,with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people
8703,HEB,9,NRSV,saying this is the blood of the covenant that god has ordained for you
8704,HEB,9,NRSV,and in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent
8705,HEB,9,NRSV,and all the vessels used in worship
8706,HEB,9,NRSV,indeed under the law almost everything is purified with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins
8707,HEB,9,NRSV,thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices than these
8708,HEB,9,NRSV,for christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands a mere copy of the true one but he entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god on our behalf
8709,HEB,9,NRSV,nor was it to offer himself again and again as the high priest enters the holy place year after year with blood that is not his own
8710,HEB,9,NRSV,for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world but as it is he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself
8711,HEB,9,NRSV,and just as it is appointed for mortals to die once and after that the judgment
8712,HEB,9,NRSV,so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him
8713,HEB,10,NRSV,since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities it
8714,HEB,10,NRSV,can never by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year make perfect those who approach
8715,HEB,10,NRSV,otherwise would they not have ceased being offered since the worshipers cleansed once for all would no longer have any consciousness of sin
8716,HEB,10,NRSV,but in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year
8717,HEB,10,NRSV,for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins
8718,HEB,10,NRSV,consequently when christ
8719,HEB,10,NRSV,came into the world he said
8720,HEB,10,NRSV,sacrifices and offerings you have not desired
8721,HEB,10,NRSV,but a body you have prepared for me
8722,HEB,10,NRSV,in burnt offerings and sin offerings
8723,HEB,10,NRSV,you have taken no pleasure
8724,HEB,10,NRSV,then i said see god i have come to do your will o god
8725,HEB,10,NRSV,in the scroll of the book
8726,HEB,10,NRSV,it is written of me
8727,HEB,10,NRSV,when he said above you have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings these are offered according to the law
8728,HEB,10,NRSV,then he added see i have come to do your will he abolishes the first in order to establish the second
8729,HEB,10,NRSV,and it is by gods will
8730,HEB,10,NRSV,that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all
8731,HEB,10,NRSV,and every priest stands day after day at his service offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins
8732,HEB,10,NRSV,but when christ
8733,HEB,10,NRSV,had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of god
8734,HEB,10,NRSV,and since then has been waiting until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet
8735,HEB,10,NRSV,for by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified
8736,HEB,10,NRSV,and the holy spirit also testifies to us for after saying
8737,HEB,10,NRSV,this is the covenant that i will make with them
8738,HEB,10,NRSV,after those days says the lord
8739,HEB,10,NRSV,i will put my laws in their hearts
8740,HEB,10,NRSV,and i will write them on their minds
8741,HEB,10,NRSV,he also adds
8742,HEB,10,NRSV,i will remember
8743,HEB,10,NRSV,their sins and their lawless deeds no more
8744,HEB,10,NRSV,where there is forgiveness of these there is no longer any offering for sin
8745,HEB,10,NRSV,therefore my friends
8746,HEB,10,NRSV,since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of jesus
8747,HEB,10,NRSV,by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh
8748,HEB,10,NRSV,and since we have a great priest over the house of god
8749,HEB,10,NRSV,let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
8750,HEB,10,NRSV,let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering for he who has promised is faithful
8751,HEB,10,NRSV,and let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds
8752,HEB,10,NRSV,not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching
8753,HEB,10,NRSV,for if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins
8754,HEB,10,NRSV,but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries
8755,HEB,10,NRSV,anyone who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses
8756,HEB,10,NRSV,how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the son of god profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace
8757,HEB,10,NRSV,for we know the one who said vengeance is mine i will repay and again the lord will judge his people
8758,HEB,10,NRSV,it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
8759,HEB,10,NRSV,but recall those earlier days when after you had been enlightened you endured a hard struggle with sufferings
8760,HEB,10,NRSV,sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution and sometimes being partners with those so treated
8761,HEB,10,NRSV,for you had compassion for those who were in prison and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting
8762,HEB,10,NRSV,do not therefore abandon that confidence of yours it brings a great reward
8763,HEB,10,NRSV,for you need endurance so that when you have done the will of god you may receive what was promised
8764,HEB,10,NRSV,for yet in a very little while
8765,HEB,10,NRSV,the one who is coming will come and will not delay
8766,HEB,10,NRSV,but my righteous one will live by faith
8767,HEB,10,NRSV,my soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back
8768,HEB,10,NRSV,but we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost but among those who have faith and so are saved
8769,HEB,11,NRSV,now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
8770,HEB,11,NRSV,indeed by faith
8771,HEB,11,NRSV,our ancestors received approval
8772,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of god so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible
8773,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abel offered to god a more acceptable
8774,HEB,11,NRSV,sacrifice than cains through this he received approval as righteous god himself giving approval to his gifts he died but through his faith
8775,HEB,11,NRSV,he still speaks
8776,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith enoch was taken so that he did not experience death and he was not found because god had taken him for it was attested before he was taken away that he had pleased god
8777,HEB,11,NRSV,and without faith it is impossible to please god for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him
8778,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith noah warned by god about events as yet unseen respected the warning and built an ark to save his household by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith
8779,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance and he set out not knowing where he was going
8780,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised as in a foreign land living in tents as did isaac and jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise
8781,HEB,11,NRSV,for he looked forward to the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is god
8782,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he received power of procreation even though he was too oldand sarah herself was barrenbecause he considered him faithful who had promised
8783,HEB,11,NRSV,therefore from one person and this one as good as dead descendants were born as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore
8784,HEB,11,NRSV,all of these died in faith without having received the promises but from a distance they saw and greeted them they confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth
8785,HEB,11,NRSV,for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland
8786,HEB,11,NRSV,if they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind they would have had opportunity to return
8787,HEB,11,NRSV,but as it is they desire a better country that is a heavenly one therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god indeed he has prepared a city for them
8788,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith abraham when put to the test offered up isaac he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son
8789,HEB,11,NRSV,of whom he had been told it is through isaac that descendants shall be named for you
8790,HEB,11,NRSV,he considered the fact that god is able even to raise someone from the deadand figuratively speaking he did receive him back
8791,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith isaac invoked blessings for the future on jacob and esau
8792,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of joseph bowing in worship over the top of his staff
8793,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith joseph at the end of his life made mention of the exodus of the israelites and gave instructions about his burial
8794,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth because they saw that the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the kings edict
8795,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith moses when he was grown up refused to be called a son of pharaohs daughter
8796,HEB,11,NRSV,choosing rather to share illtreatment with the people of god than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin
8797,HEB,11,NRSV,he considered abuse suffered for the christ
8798,HEB,11,NRSV,to be greater wealth than the treasures of egypt for he was looking ahead to the reward
8799,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he left egypt unafraid of the kings anger for he persevered as though
8800,HEB,11,NRSV,he saw him who is invisible
8801,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of israel
8802,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith the people passed through the red sea as if it were dry land but when the egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned
8803,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith the walls of jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days
8804,HEB,11,NRSV,by faith rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient
8805,HEB,11,NRSV,because she had received the spies in peace
8806,HEB,11,NRSV,and what more should i say for time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets
8807,HEB,11,NRSV,who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice obtained promises shut the mouths of lions
8808,HEB,11,NRSV,quenched raging fire escaped the edge of the sword won strength out of weakness became mighty in war put foreign armies to flight
8809,HEB,11,NRSV,women received their dead by resurrection others were tortured refusing to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection
8810,HEB,11,NRSV,others suffered mocking and flogging and even chains and imprisonment
8811,HEB,11,NRSV,they were stoned to death they were sawn in two
8812,HEB,11,NRSV,they were killed by the sword they went about in skins of sheep and goats destitute persecuted tormented
8813,HEB,11,NRSV,of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and in caves and holes in the ground
8814,HEB,11,NRSV,yet all these though they were commended for their faith did not receive what was promised
8815,HEB,11,NRSV,since god had provided something better so that they would not apart from us be made perfect
8816,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely
8817,HEB,12,NRSV,and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us
8818,HEB,12,NRSV,looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the sake of
8819,HEB,12,NRSV,the joy that was set before him endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god
8820,HEB,12,NRSV,consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners
8821,HEB,12,NRSV,so that you may not grow weary or lose heart
8822,HEB,12,NRSV,in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood
8823,HEB,12,NRSV,and you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children
8824,HEB,12,NRSV,my child do not regard lightly the discipline of the lord
8825,HEB,12,NRSV,or lose heart when you are punished by him
8826,HEB,12,NRSV,for the lord disciplines those whom he loves
8827,HEB,12,NRSV,and chastises every child whom he accepts
8828,HEB,12,NRSV,endure trials for the sake of discipline god is treating you as children for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline
8829,HEB,12,NRSV,if you do not have that discipline in which all children share then you are illegitimate and not his children
8830,HEB,12,NRSV,moreover we had human parents to discipline us and we respected them should we not be even more willing to be subject to the father of spirits and live
8831,HEB,12,NRSV,for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good in order that we may share his holiness
8832,HEB,12,NRSV,now discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it
8833,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees
8834,HEB,12,NRSV,and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed
8835,HEB,12,NRSV,pursue peace with everyone and the holiness without which no one will see the lord
8836,HEB,12,NRSV,see to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of god that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble and through it many become defiled
8837,HEB,12,NRSV,see to it that no one becomes like esau an immoral and godless person who sold his birthright for a single meal
8838,HEB,12,NRSV,you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent
8839,HEB,12,NRSV,even though he sought the blessing
8840,HEB,12,NRSV,with tears
8841,HEB,12,NRSV,you have not come to something
8842,HEB,12,NRSV,that can be touched a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
8843,HEB,12,NRSV,and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them
8844,HEB,12,NRSV,for they could not endure the order that was given if even an animal touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death
8845,HEB,12,NRSV,indeed so terrifying was the sight that moses said i tremble with fear
8846,HEB,12,NRSV,but you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering
8847,HEB,12,NRSV,and to the assembly
8848,HEB,12,NRSV,of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect
8849,HEB,12,NRSV,and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel
8850,HEB,12,NRSV,see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven
8851,HEB,12,NRSV,at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven
8852,HEB,12,NRSV,this phrase yet once more indicates the removal of what is shakenthat is created thingsso that what cannot be shaken may remain
8853,HEB,12,NRSV,therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us give thanks by which we offer to god an acceptable worship with reverence and awe
8854,HEB,12,NRSV,for indeed our god is a consuming fire
8855,HEB,13,NRSV,let mutual love continue
8856,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it
8857,HEB,13,NRSV,remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with them those who are being tortured as though you yourselves were being tortured
8858,HEB,13,NRSV,let marriage be held in honor by all and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled for god will judge fornicators and adulterers
8859,HEB,13,NRSV,keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you
8860,HEB,13,NRSV,so we can say with confidence
8861,HEB,13,NRSV,the lord is my helper
8862,HEB,13,NRSV,i will not be afraid
8863,HEB,13,NRSV,what can anyone do to me
8864,HEB,13,NRSV,remember your leaders those who spoke the word of god to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith
8865,HEB,13,NRSV,jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
8866,HEB,13,NRSV,do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings for it is well for the heart to be strengthened by grace not by regulations about food
8867,HEB,13,NRSV,which have not benefited those who observe them
8868,HEB,13,NRSV,we have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent
8869,HEB,13,NRSV,have no right to eat
8870,HEB,13,NRSV,for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp
8871,HEB,13,NRSV,therefore jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood
8872,HEB,13,NRSV,let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured
8873,HEB,13,NRSV,for here we have no lasting city but we are looking for the city that is to come
8874,HEB,13,NRSV,through him then let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that confess his name
8875,HEB,13,NRSV,do not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to god
8876,HEB,13,NRSV,obey your leaders and submit to them for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an account let them do this with joy and not with sighingfor that would be harmful to you
8877,HEB,13,NRSV,pray for us we are sure that we have a clear conscience desiring to act honorably in all things
8878,HEB,13,NRSV,i urge you all the more to do this so that i may be restored to you very soon
8879,HEB,13,NRSV,now may the god of peace who brought back from the dead our lord jesus the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of the eternal covenant
8880,HEB,13,NRSV,make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will working among us
8881,HEB,13,NRSV,that which is pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever and ever amen
8882,HEB,13,NRSV,i appeal to you brothers and sisters
8883,HEB,13,NRSV,bear with my word of exhortation for i have written to you briefly
8884,HEB,13,NRSV,i want you to know that our brother timothy has been set free and if he comes in time he will be with me when i see you
8885,HEB,13,NRSV,greet all your leaders and all the saints those from italy send you greetings
8886,HEB,13,NRSV,grace be with all of you
8887,JAS,1,NRSV,james a servant
8888,JAS,1,NRSV,of god and of the lord jesus christ
8889,JAS,1,NRSV,to the twelve tribes in the dispersion
8890,JAS,1,NRSV,greetings
8891,JAS,1,NRSV,my brothers and sisters
8892,JAS,1,NRSV,whenever you face trials of any kind consider it nothing but joy
8893,JAS,1,NRSV,because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance
8894,JAS,1,NRSV,and let endurance have its full effect so that you may be mature and complete lacking in nothing
8895,JAS,1,NRSV,if any of you is lacking in wisdom ask god who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly and it will be given you
8896,JAS,1,NRSV,but ask in faith never doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind
8897,JAS,1,NRSV,for the doubter being doubleminded and unstable in every way must not expect to receive anything from the lord
8898,JAS,1,NRSV,let the believer
8899,JAS,1,NRSV,who is lowly boast in being raised up
8900,JAS,1,NRSV,and the rich in being brought low because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field
8901,JAS,1,NRSV,for the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field its flower falls and its beauty perishes it is the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life they will wither away
8902,JAS,1,NRSV,blessed is anyone who endures temptation such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the lord
8903,JAS,1,NRSV,has promised to those who love him
8904,JAS,1,NRSV,no one when tempted should say i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one
8905,JAS,1,NRSV,but one is tempted by ones own desire being lured and enticed by it
8906,JAS,1,NRSV,then when that desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and that sin when it is fully grown gives birth to death
8907,JAS,1,NRSV,do not be deceived my beloved
8908,JAS,1,NRSV,every generous act of giving with every perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change
8909,JAS,1,NRSV,in fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures
8910,JAS,1,NRSV,you must understand this my beloved
8911,JAS,1,NRSV,let everyone be quick to listen slow to speak slow to anger
8912,JAS,1,NRSV,for your anger does not produce gods righteousness
8913,JAS,1,NRSV,therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls
8914,JAS,1,NRSV,but be doers of the word and not merely hearers who deceive themselves
8915,JAS,1,NRSV,for if any are hearers of the word and not doers they are like those who look at themselves
8916,JAS,1,NRSV,in a mirror
8917,JAS,1,NRSV,for they look at themselves and on going away immediately forget what they were like
8918,JAS,1,NRSV,but those who look into the perfect law the law of liberty and persevere being not hearers who forget but doers who actthey will be blessed in their doing
8919,JAS,1,NRSV,if any think they are religious and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts their religion is worthless
8920,JAS,1,NRSV,religion that is pure and undefiled before god the father is this to care for orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world
8921,JAS,2,NRSV,my brothers and sisters
8922,JAS,2,NRSV,do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious lord jesus christ
8923,JAS,2,NRSV,for if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in
8924,JAS,2,NRSV,and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say have a seat here please while to the one who is poor you say stand there or sit at my feet
8925,JAS,2,NRSV,have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts
8926,JAS,2,NRSV,listen my beloved brothers and sisters
8927,JAS,2,NRSV,has not god chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him
8928,JAS,2,NRSV,but you have dishonored the poor is it not the rich who oppress you is it not they who drag you into court
8929,JAS,2,NRSV,is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you
8930,JAS,2,NRSV,you do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture you shall love your neighbor as yourself
8931,JAS,2,NRSV,but if you show partiality you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors
8932,JAS,2,NRSV,for whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it
8933,JAS,2,NRSV,for the one who said you shall not commit adultery also said you shall not murder now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder you have become a transgressor of the law
8934,JAS,2,NRSV,so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty
8935,JAS,2,NRSV,for judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy mercy triumphs over judgment
8936,JAS,2,NRSV,what good is it my brothers and sisters
8937,JAS,2,NRSV,if you say you have faith but do not have works can faith save you
8938,JAS,2,NRSV,if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food
8939,JAS,2,NRSV,and one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and eat your fill and yet you do not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that
8940,JAS,2,NRSV,so faith by itself if it has no works is dead
8941,JAS,2,NRSV,but someone will say you have faith and i have works show me your faith apart from your works and i by my works will show you my faith
8942,JAS,2,NRSV,you believe that god is one you do well even the demons believeand shudder
8943,JAS,2,NRSV,do you want to be shown you senseless person that faith apart from works is barren
8944,JAS,2,NRSV,was not our ancestor abraham justified by works when he offered his son isaac on the altar
8945,JAS,2,NRSV,you see that faith was active along with his works and faith was brought to completion by the works
8946,JAS,2,NRSV,thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god
8947,JAS,2,NRSV,you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone
8948,JAS,2,NRSV,likewise was not rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road
8949,JAS,2,NRSV,for just as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is also dead
8950,JAS,3,NRSV,not many of you should become teachers my brothers and sisters
8951,JAS,3,NRSV,for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness
8952,JAS,3,NRSV,for all of us make many mistakes anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle
8953,JAS,3,NRSV,if we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we guide their whole bodies
8954,JAS,3,NRSV,or look at ships though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs
8955,JAS,3,NRSV,so also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great exploits
8956,JAS,3,NRSV,how great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire
8957,JAS,3,NRSV,and the tongue is a fire the tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity it stains the whole body sets on fire the cycle of nature
8958,JAS,3,NRSV,and is itself set on fire by hell
8959,JAS,3,NRSV,for every species of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species
8960,JAS,3,NRSV,but no one can tame the tonguea restless evil full of deadly poison
8961,JAS,3,NRSV,with it we bless the lord and father and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of god
8962,JAS,3,NRSV,from the same mouth come blessing and cursing my brothers and sisters
8963,JAS,3,NRSV,this ought not to be so
8964,JAS,3,NRSV,does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water
8965,JAS,3,NRSV,can a fig tree my brothers and sisters
8966,JAS,3,NRSV,yield olives or a grapevine figs no more can salt water yield fresh
8967,JAS,3,NRSV,who is wise and understanding among you show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom
8968,JAS,3,NRSV,but if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not be boastful and false to the truth
8969,JAS,3,NRSV,such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly unspiritual devilish
8970,JAS,3,NRSV,for where there is envy and selfish ambition there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind
8971,JAS,3,NRSV,but the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable gentle willing to yield full of mercy and good fruits without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy
8972,JAS,3,NRSV,and a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for
8973,JAS,3,NRSV,those who make peace
8974,JAS,4,NRSV,those conflicts and disputes among you where do they come from do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you
8975,JAS,4,NRSV,you want something and do not have it so you commit murder and you covet
8976,JAS,4,NRSV,something and cannot obtain it so you engage in disputes and conflicts you do not have because you do not ask
8977,JAS,4,NRSV,you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly in order to spend what you get on your pleasures
8978,JAS,4,NRSV,adulterers do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god
8979,JAS,4,NRSV,or do you suppose that it is for nothing that the scripture says god
8980,JAS,4,NRSV,yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us
8981,JAS,4,NRSV,but he gives all the more grace therefore it says
8982,JAS,4,NRSV,god opposes the proud
8983,JAS,4,NRSV,but gives grace to the humble
8984,JAS,4,NRSV,submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
8985,JAS,4,NRSV,draw near to god and he will draw near to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doubleminded
8986,JAS,4,NRSV,lament and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection
8987,JAS,4,NRSV,humble yourselves before the lord and he will exalt you
8988,JAS,4,NRSV,do not speak evil against one another brothers and sisters
8989,JAS,4,NRSV,whoever speaks evil against another or judges another speaks evil against the law and judges the law but if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge
8990,JAS,4,NRSV,there is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy so who then are you to judge your neighbor
8991,JAS,4,NRSV,come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money
8992,JAS,4,NRSV,yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring what is your life for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes
8993,JAS,4,NRSV,instead you ought to say if the lord wishes we will live and do this or that
8994,JAS,4,NRSV,as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil
8995,JAS,4,NRSV,anyone then who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it commits sin
8996,JAS,5,NRSV,come now you rich people weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you
8997,JAS,5,NRSV,your riches have rotted and your clothes are motheaten
8998,JAS,5,NRSV,your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be evidence against you and it will eat your flesh like fire you have laid up treasure
8999,JAS,5,NRSV,for the last days
9000,JAS,5,NRSV,listen the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields which you kept back by fraud cry out and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts
9001,JAS,5,NRSV,you have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter
9002,JAS,5,NRSV,you have condemned and murdered the righteous one who does not resist you
9003,JAS,5,NRSV,be patient therefore beloved
9004,JAS,5,NRSV,until the coming of the lord the farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains
9005,JAS,5,NRSV,you also must be patient strengthen your hearts for the coming of the lord is near
9006,JAS,5,NRSV,beloved
9007,JAS,5,NRSV,do not grumble against one another so that you may not be judged see the judge is standing at the doors
9008,JAS,5,NRSV,as an example of suffering and patience beloved
9009,JAS,5,NRSV,take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord
9010,JAS,5,NRSV,indeed we call blessed those who showed endurance you have heard of the endurance of job and you have seen the purpose of the lord how the lord is compassionate and merciful
9011,JAS,5,NRSV,above all my beloved
9012,JAS,5,NRSV,do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath but let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not fall under condemnation
9013,JAS,5,NRSV,are any among you suffering they should pray are any cheerful they should sing songs of praise
9014,JAS,5,NRSV,are any among you sick they should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them anointing them with oil in the name of the lord
9015,JAS,5,NRSV,the prayer of faith will save the sick and the lord will raise them up and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven
9016,JAS,5,NRSV,therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective
9017,JAS,5,NRSV,elijah was a human being like us and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth
9018,JAS,5,NRSV,then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest
9019,JAS,5,NRSV,my brothers and sisters
9020,JAS,5,NRSV,if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another
9021,JAS,5,NRSV,you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinners
9022,JAS,5,NRSV,soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins
9023,1PE,1,NRSV,peter an apostle of jesus christ
9024,1PE,1,NRSV,to the exiles of the dispersion in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
9025,1PE,1,NRSV,who have been chosen and destined by god the father and sanctified by the spirit to be obedient to jesus christ and to be sprinkled with his blood
9026,1PE,1,NRSV,may grace and peace be yours in abundance
9027,1PE,1,NRSV,blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ by his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
9028,1PE,1,NRSV,and into an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you
9029,1PE,1,NRSV,who are being protected by the power of god through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
9030,1PE,1,NRSV,in this you rejoice
9031,1PE,1,NRSV,even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials
9032,1PE,1,NRSV,so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more precious than gold that though perishable is tested by firemay be found to result in praise and glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed
9033,1PE,1,NRSV,although you have not seen
9034,1PE,1,NRSV,him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy
9035,1PE,1,NRSV,for you are receiving the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls
9036,1PE,1,NRSV,concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours made careful search and inquiry
9037,1PE,1,NRSV,inquiring about the person or time that the spirit of christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for christ and the subsequent glory
9038,1PE,1,NRSV,it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who brought you good news by the holy spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look
9039,1PE,1,NRSV,therefore prepare your minds for action
9040,1PE,1,NRSV,discipline yourselves set all your hope on the grace that jesus christ will bring you when he is revealed
9041,1PE,1,NRSV,like obedient children do not be conformed to the desires that you formerly had in ignorance
9042,1PE,1,NRSV,instead as he who called you is holy be holy yourselves in all your conduct
9043,1PE,1,NRSV,for it is written you shall be holy for i am holy
9044,1PE,1,NRSV,if you invoke as father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds live in reverent fear during the time of your exile
9045,1PE,1,NRSV,you know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors not with perishable things like silver or gold
9046,1PE,1,NRSV,but with the precious blood of christ like that of a lamb without defect or blemish
9047,1PE,1,NRSV,he was destined before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake
9048,1PE,1,NRSV,through him you have come to trust in god who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are set on god
9049,1PE,1,NRSV,now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth
9050,1PE,1,NRSV,so that you have genuine mutual love love one another deeply
9051,1PE,1,NRSV,from the heart
9052,1PE,1,NRSV,you have been born anew not of perishable but of imperishable seed through the living and enduring word of god
9053,1PE,1,NRSV,for
9054,1PE,1,NRSV,all flesh is like grass
9055,1PE,1,NRSV,and all its glory like the flower of grass
9056,1PE,1,NRSV,the grass withers
9057,1PE,1,NRSV,and the flower falls
9058,1PE,1,NRSV,but the word of the lord endures forever
9059,1PE,1,NRSV,that word is the good news that was announced to you
9060,1PE,2,NRSV,rid yourselves therefore of all malice and all guile insincerity envy and all slander
9061,1PE,2,NRSV,like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow into salvation
9062,1PE,2,NRSV,if indeed you have tasted that the lord is good
9063,1PE,2,NRSV,come to him a living stone though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in gods sight and
9064,1PE,2,NRSV,like living stones let yourselves be built
9065,1PE,2,NRSV,into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ
9066,1PE,2,NRSV,for it stands in scripture
9067,1PE,2,NRSV,see i am laying in zion a stone
9068,1PE,2,NRSV,a cornerstone chosen and precious
9069,1PE,2,NRSV,and whoever believes in him
9070,1PE,2,NRSV,will not be put to shame
9071,1PE,2,NRSV,to you then who believe he is precious but for those who do not believe
9072,1PE,2,NRSV,the stone that the builders rejected
9073,1PE,2,NRSV,has become the very head of the corner
9074,1PE,2,NRSV,and
9075,1PE,2,NRSV,a stone that makes them stumble
9076,1PE,2,NRSV,and a rock that makes them fall
9077,1PE,2,NRSV,they stumble because they disobey the word as they were destined to do
9078,1PE,2,NRSV,but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation gods own people
9079,1PE,2,NRSV,in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
9080,1PE,2,NRSV,once you were not a people
9081,1PE,2,NRSV,but now you are gods people
9082,1PE,2,NRSV,once you had not received mercy
9083,1PE,2,NRSV,but now you have received mercy
9084,1PE,2,NRSV,beloved i urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul
9085,1PE,2,NRSV,conduct yourselves honorably among the gentiles so that though they malign you as evildoers they may see your honorable deeds and glorify god when he comes to judge
9086,1PE,2,NRSV,for the lords sake accept the authority of every human institution
9087,1PE,2,NRSV,whether of the emperor as supreme
9088,1PE,2,NRSV,or of governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right
9089,1PE,2,NRSV,for it is gods will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish
9090,1PE,2,NRSV,as servants
9091,1PE,2,NRSV,of god live as free people yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil
9092,1PE,2,NRSV,honor everyone love the family of believers
9093,1PE,2,NRSV,fear god honor the emperor
9094,1PE,2,NRSV,slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh
9095,1PE,2,NRSV,for it is a credit to you if being aware of god you endure pain while suffering unjustly
9096,1PE,2,NRSV,if you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong what credit is that but if you endure when you do right and suffer for it you have gods approval
9097,1PE,2,NRSV,for to this you have been called because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps
9098,1PE,2,NRSV,he committed no sin
9099,1PE,2,NRSV,and no deceit was found in his mouth
9100,1PE,2,NRSV,when he was abused he did not return abuse when he suffered he did not threaten but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly
9101,1PE,2,NRSV,he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross
9102,1PE,2,NRSV,so that free from sins we might live for righteousness by his wounds
9103,1PE,2,NRSV,you have been healed
9104,1PE,2,NRSV,for you were going astray like sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls
9105,1PE,3,NRSV,wives in the same way accept the authority of your husbands so that even if some of them do not obey the word they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct
9106,1PE,3,NRSV,when they see the purity and reverence of your lives
9107,1PE,3,NRSV,do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing
9108,1PE,3,NRSV,rather let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is very precious in gods sight
9109,1PE,3,NRSV,it was in this way long ago that the holy women who hoped in god used to adorn themselves by accepting the authority of their husbands
9110,1PE,3,NRSV,thus sarah obeyed abraham and called him lord you have become her daughters as long as you do what is good and never let fears alarm you
9111,1PE,3,NRSV,husbands in the same way show consideration for your wives in your life together paying honor to the woman as the weaker sex
9112,1PE,3,NRSV,since they too are also heirs of the gracious gift of lifeso that nothing may hinder your prayers
9113,1PE,3,NRSV,finally all of you have unity of spirit sympathy love for one another a tender heart and a humble mind
9114,1PE,3,NRSV,do not repay evil for evil or abuse for abuse but on the contrary repay with a blessing it is for this that you were calledthat you might inherit a blessing
9115,1PE,3,NRSV,for
9116,1PE,3,NRSV,those who desire life
9117,1PE,3,NRSV,and desire to see good days
9118,1PE,3,NRSV,let them keep their tongues from evil
9119,1PE,3,NRSV,and their lips from speaking deceit
9120,1PE,3,NRSV,let them turn away from evil and do good
9121,1PE,3,NRSV,let them seek peace and pursue it
9122,1PE,3,NRSV,for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous
9123,1PE,3,NRSV,and his ears are open to their prayer
9124,1PE,3,NRSV,but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
9125,1PE,3,NRSV,now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good
9126,1PE,3,NRSV,but even if you do suffer for doing what is right you are blessed do not fear what they fear
9127,1PE,3,NRSV,and do not be intimidated
9128,1PE,3,NRSV,but in your hearts sanctify christ as lord always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you
9129,1PE,3,NRSV,yet do it with gentleness and reverence
9130,1PE,3,NRSV,keep your conscience clear so that when you are maligned those who abuse you for your good conduct in christ may be put to shame
9131,1PE,3,NRSV,for it is better to suffer for doing good if suffering should be gods will than to suffer for doing evil
9132,1PE,3,NRSV,for christ also suffered
9133,1PE,3,NRSV,for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous in order to bring you
9134,1PE,3,NRSV,to god he was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit
9135,1PE,3,NRSV,in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison
9136,1PE,3,NRSV,who in former times did not obey when god waited patiently in the days of noah during the building of the ark in which a few that is eight persons were saved through water
9137,1PE,3,NRSV,and baptism which this prefigured now saves younot as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to god for
9138,1PE,3,NRSV,a good conscience through the resurrection of jesus christ
9139,1PE,3,NRSV,who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god with angels authorities and powers made subject to him
9140,1PE,4,NRSV,since therefore christ suffered in the flesh
9141,1PE,4,NRSV,arm yourselves also with the same intention for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin
9142,1PE,4,NRSV,so as to live for the rest of your earthly life
9143,1PE,4,NRSV,no longer by human desires but by the will of god
9144,1PE,4,NRSV,you have already spent enough time in doing what the gentiles like to do living in licentiousness passions drunkenness revels carousing and lawless idolatry
9145,1PE,4,NRSV,they are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation and so they blaspheme
9146,1PE,4,NRSV,but they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead
9147,1PE,4,NRSV,for this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead so that though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged they might live in the spirit as god does
9148,1PE,4,NRSV,the end of all things is near
9149,1PE,4,NRSV,therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers
9150,1PE,4,NRSV,above all maintain constant love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins
9151,1PE,4,NRSV,be hospitable to one another without complaining
9152,1PE,4,NRSV,like good stewards of the manifold grace of god serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received
9153,1PE,4,NRSV,whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of god whoever serves must do so with the strength that god supplies so that god may be glorified in all things through jesus christ to him belong the glory and the power forever and ever amen
9154,1PE,4,NRSV,beloved do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you as though something strange were happening to you
9155,1PE,4,NRSV,but rejoice insofar as you are sharing christs sufferings so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed
9156,1PE,4,NRSV,if you are reviled for the name of christ you are blessed because the spirit of glory
9157,1PE,4,NRSV,which is the spirit of god is resting on you
9158,1PE,4,NRSV,but let none of you suffer as a murderer a thief a criminal or even as a mischief maker
9159,1PE,4,NRSV,yet if any of you suffers as a christian do not consider it a disgrace but glorify god because you bear this name
9160,1PE,4,NRSV,for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of god if it begins with us what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of god
9161,1PE,4,NRSV,and
9162,1PE,4,NRSV,if it is hard for the righteous to be saved
9163,1PE,4,NRSV,what will become of the ungodly and the sinners
9164,1PE,4,NRSV,therefore let those suffering in accordance with gods will entrust themselves to a faithful creator while continuing to do good
9165,1PE,5,NRSV,now as an elder myself and a witness of the sufferings of christ as well as one who shares in the glory to be revealed i exhort the elders among you
9166,1PE,5,NRSV,to tend the flock of god that is in your charge exercising the oversight
9167,1PE,5,NRSV,not under compulsion but willingly as god would have you do it
9168,1PE,5,NRSV,not for sordid gain but eagerly
9169,1PE,5,NRSV,do not lord it over those in your charge but be examples to the flock
9170,1PE,5,NRSV,and when the chief shepherd appears you will win the crown of glory that never fades away
9171,1PE,5,NRSV,in the same way you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders
9172,1PE,5,NRSV,and all of you must clothe yourselves with humility in your dealings with one another for
9173,1PE,5,NRSV,god opposes the proud
9174,1PE,5,NRSV,but gives grace to the humble
9175,1PE,5,NRSV,humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god so that he may exalt you in due time
9176,1PE,5,NRSV,cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you
9177,1PE,5,NRSV,discipline yourselves keep alert
9178,1PE,5,NRSV,like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around looking for someone to devour
9179,1PE,5,NRSV,resist him steadfast in your faith for you know that your brothers and sisters
9180,1PE,5,NRSV,in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering
9181,1PE,5,NRSV,and after you have suffered for a little while the god of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself restore support strengthen and establish you
9182,1PE,5,NRSV,to him be the power forever and ever amen
9183,1PE,5,NRSV,through silvanus whom i consider a faithful brother i have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of god stand fast in it
9184,1PE,5,NRSV,your sister church
9185,1PE,5,NRSV,in babylon chosen together with you sends you greetings and so does my son mark
9186,1PE,5,NRSV,greet one another with a kiss of love
9187,1PE,5,NRSV,peace to all of you who are in christ
9188,2PE,1,NRSV,simeon
9189,2PE,1,NRSV,peter a servant
9190,2PE,1,NRSV,and apostle of jesus christ
9191,2PE,1,NRSV,to those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ
9192,2PE,1,NRSV,may grace and peace be yours in abundance in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
9193,2PE,1,NRSV,his divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by
9194,2PE,1,NRSV,his own glory and goodness
9195,2PE,1,NRSV,thus he has given us through these things his precious and very great promises so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become participants of the divine nature
9196,2PE,1,NRSV,for this very reason you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness and goodness with knowledge
9197,2PE,1,NRSV,and knowledge with selfcontrol and selfcontrol with endurance and endurance with godliness
9198,2PE,1,NRSV,and godliness with mutual
9199,2PE,1,NRSV,affection and mutual
9200,2PE,1,NRSV,affection with love
9201,2PE,1,NRSV,for if these things are yours and are increasing among you they keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
9202,2PE,1,NRSV,for anyone who lacks these things is nearsighted and blind and is forgetful of the cleansing of past sins
9203,2PE,1,NRSV,therefore brothers and sisters
9204,2PE,1,NRSV,be all the more eager to confirm your call and election for if you do this you will never stumble
9205,2PE,1,NRSV,for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly provided for you
9206,2PE,1,NRSV,therefore i intend to keep on reminding you of these things though you know them already and are established in the truth that has come to you
9207,2PE,1,NRSV,i think it right as long as i am in this body
9208,2PE,1,NRSV,to refresh your memory
9209,2PE,1,NRSV,since i know that my death
9210,2PE,1,NRSV,will come soon as indeed our lord jesus christ has made clear to me
9211,2PE,1,NRSV,and i will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things
9212,2PE,1,NRSV,for we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty
9213,2PE,1,NRSV,for he received honor and glory from god the father when that voice was conveyed to him by the majestic glory saying this is my son my beloved
9214,2PE,1,NRSV,with whom i am well pleased
9215,2PE,1,NRSV,we ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain
9216,2PE,1,NRSV,so we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed you will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts
9217,2PE,1,NRSV,first of all you must understand this that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation
9218,2PE,1,NRSV,because no prophecy ever came by human will but men and women moved by the holy spirit spoke from god
9219,2PE,2,NRSV,but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive opinions they will even deny the master who bought thembringing swift destruction on themselves
9220,2PE,2,NRSV,even so many will follow their licentious ways and because of these teachers
9221,2PE,2,NRSV,the way of truth will be maligned
9222,2PE,2,NRSV,and in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words their condemnation pronounced against them long ago has not been idle and their destruction is not asleep
9223,2PE,2,NRSV,for if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell
9224,2PE,2,NRSV,and committed them to chains
9225,2PE,2,NRSV,of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment
9226,2PE,2,NRSV,and if he did not spare the ancient world even though he saved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood on a world of the ungodly
9227,2PE,2,NRSV,and if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction
9228,2PE,2,NRSV,and made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly
9229,2PE,2,NRSV,and if he rescued lot a righteous man greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the lawless
9230,2PE,2,NRSV,for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard
9231,2PE,2,NRSV,then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment
9232,2PE,2,NRSV,especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust and who despise authority
9233,2PE,2,NRSV,bold and willful they are not afraid to slander the glorious ones
9234,2PE,2,NRSV,whereas angels though greater in might and power do not bring against them a slanderous judgment from the lord
9235,2PE,2,NRSV,these people however are like irrational animals mere creatures of instinct born to be caught and killed they slander what they do not understand and when those creatures are destroyed
9236,2PE,2,NRSV,they also will be destroyed
9237,2PE,2,NRSV,suffering
9238,2PE,2,NRSV,the penalty for doing wrong they count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime they are blots and blemishes reveling in their dissipation
9239,2PE,2,NRSV,while they feast with you
9240,2PE,2,NRSV,they have eyes full of adultery insatiable for sin they entice unsteady souls they have hearts trained in greed accursed children
9241,2PE,2,NRSV,they have left the straight road and have gone astray following the road of balaam son of bosor
9242,2PE,2,NRSV,who loved the wages of doing wrong
9243,2PE,2,NRSV,but was rebuked for his own transgression a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophets madness
9244,2PE,2,NRSV,these are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm for them the deepest darkness has been reserved
9245,2PE,2,NRSV,for they speak bombastic nonsense and with licentious desires of the flesh they entice people who have just
9246,2PE,2,NRSV,escaped from those who live in error
9247,2PE,2,NRSV,they promise them freedom but they themselves are slaves of corruption for people are slaves to whatever masters them
9248,2PE,2,NRSV,for if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overpowered the last state has become worse for them than the first
9249,2PE,2,NRSV,for it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that was passed on to them
9250,2PE,2,NRSV,it has happened to them according to the true proverb
9251,2PE,2,NRSV,the dog turns back to its own vomit
9252,2PE,2,NRSV,and
9253,2PE,2,NRSV,the sow is washed only to wallow in the mud
9254,2PE,3,NRSV,this is now beloved the second letter i am writing to you in them i am trying to arouse your sincere intention by reminding you
9255,2PE,3,NRSV,that you should remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of the lord and savior spoken through your apostles
9256,2PE,3,NRSV,first of all you must understand this that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and indulging their own lusts
9257,2PE,3,NRSV,and saying where is the promise of his coming for ever since our ancestors died
9258,2PE,3,NRSV,all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation
9259,2PE,3,NRSV,they deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of god heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water
9260,2PE,3,NRSV,through which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished
9261,2PE,3,NRSV,but by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the godless
9262,2PE,3,NRSV,but do not ignore this one fact beloved that with the lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day
9263,2PE,3,NRSV,the lord is not slow about his promise as some think of slowness but is patient with you
9264,2PE,3,NRSV,not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance
9265,2PE,3,NRSV,but the day of the lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the elements will be dissolved with fire and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed
9266,2PE,3,NRSV,since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness
9267,2PE,3,NRSV,waiting for and hastening
9268,2PE,3,NRSV,the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire
9269,2PE,3,NRSV,but in accordance with his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth where righteousness is at home
9270,2PE,3,NRSV,therefore beloved while you are waiting for these things strive to be found by him at peace without spot or blemish
9271,2PE,3,NRSV,and regard the patience of our lord as salvation so also our beloved brother paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him
9272,2PE,3,NRSV,speaking of this as he does in all his letters there are some things in them hard to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures
9273,2PE,3,NRSV,you therefore beloved since you are forewarned beware that you are not carried away with the error of the lawless and lose your own stability
9274,2PE,3,NRSV,but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity amen
9275,1JN,1,NRSV,we declare to you what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life
9276,1JN,1,NRSV,this life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it and declare to you the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us
9277,1JN,1,NRSV,we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
9278,1JN,1,NRSV,we are writing these things so that our
9279,1JN,1,NRSV,joy may be complete
9280,1JN,1,NRSV,this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all
9281,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness we lie and do not do what is true
9282,1JN,1,NRSV,but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin
9283,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
9284,1JN,1,NRSV,if we confess our sins he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
9285,1JN,1,NRSV,if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
9286,1JN,2,NRSV,my little children i am writing these things to you so that you may not sin but if anyone does sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
9287,1JN,2,NRSV,and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
9288,1JN,2,NRSV,now by this we may be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments
9289,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i have come to know him but does not obey his commandments is a liar and in such a person the truth does not exist
9290,1JN,2,NRSV,but whoever obeys his word truly in this person the love of god has reached perfection by this we may be sure that we are in him
9291,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i abide in him ought to walk just as he walked
9292,1JN,2,NRSV,beloved i am writing you no new commandment but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word that you have heard
9293,1JN,2,NRSV,yet i am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you because
9294,1JN,2,NRSV,the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining
9295,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever says i am in the light while hating a brother or sister
9296,1JN,2,NRSV,is still in the darkness
9297,1JN,2,NRSV,whoever loves a brother or sister
9298,1JN,2,NRSV,lives in the light and in such a person
9299,1JN,2,NRSV,there is no cause for stumbling
9300,1JN,2,NRSV,but whoever hates another believer
9301,1JN,2,NRSV,is in the darkness walks in the darkness and does not know the way to go because the darkness has brought on blindness
9302,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you little children
9303,1JN,2,NRSV,because your sins are forgiven on account of his name
9304,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you fathers
9305,1JN,2,NRSV,because you know him who is from the beginning
9306,1JN,2,NRSV,i am writing to you young people
9307,1JN,2,NRSV,because you have conquered the evil one
9308,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you children
9309,1JN,2,NRSV,because you know the father
9310,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you fathers
9311,1JN,2,NRSV,because you know him who is from the beginning
9312,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you young people
9313,1JN,2,NRSV,because you are strong
9314,1JN,2,NRSV,and the word of god abides in you
9315,1JN,2,NRSV,and you have overcome the evil one
9316,1JN,2,NRSV,do not love the world or the things in the world the love of the father is not in those who love the world
9317,1JN,2,NRSV,for all that is in the worldthe desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes the pride in richescomes not from the father but from the world
9318,1JN,2,NRSV,and the world and its desire
9319,1JN,2,NRSV,are passing away but those who do the will of god live forever
9320,1JN,2,NRSV,children it is the last hour as you have heard that antichrist is coming so now many antichrists have come from this we know that it is the last hour
9321,1JN,2,NRSV,they went out from us but they did not belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us but by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us
9322,1JN,2,NRSV,but you have been anointed by the holy one and all of you have knowledge
9323,1JN,2,NRSV,i write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you know it and you know that no lie comes from the truth
9324,1JN,2,NRSV,who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ
9325,1JN,2,NRSV,this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son
9326,1JN,2,NRSV,no one who denies the son has the father everyone who confesses the son has the father also
9327,1JN,2,NRSV,let what you heard from the beginning abide in you if what you heard from the beginning abides in you then you will abide in the son and in the father
9328,1JN,2,NRSV,and this is what he has promised us
9329,1JN,2,NRSV,eternal life
9330,1JN,2,NRSV,i write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you
9331,1JN,2,NRSV,as for you the anointing that you received from him abides in you and so you do not need anyone to teach you but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie and just as it has taught you abide in him
9332,1JN,2,NRSV,and now little children abide in him so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming
9333,1JN,2,NRSV,if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him
9334,1JN,3,NRSV,see what love the father has given us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him
9335,1JN,3,NRSV,beloved we are gods children now what we will be has not yet been revealed what we do know is this when he
9336,1JN,3,NRSV,is revealed we will be like him for we will see him as he is
9337,1JN,3,NRSV,and all who have this hope in him purify themselves just as he is pure
9338,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness sin is lawlessness
9339,1JN,3,NRSV,you know that he was revealed to take away sins and in him there is no sin
9340,1JN,3,NRSV,no one who abides in him sins no one who sins has either seen him or known him
9341,1JN,3,NRSV,little children let no one deceive you everyone who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous
9342,1JN,3,NRSV,everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning the son of god was revealed for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil
9343,1JN,3,NRSV,those who have been born of god do not sin because gods seed abides in them
9344,1JN,3,NRSV,they cannot sin because they have been born of god
9345,1JN,3,NRSV,the children of god and the children of the devil are revealed in this way all who do not do what is right are not from god nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters
9346,1JN,3,NRSV,for this is the message you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another
9347,1JN,3,NRSV,we must not be like cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother and why did he murder him because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous
9348,1JN,3,NRSV,do not be astonished brothers and sisters
9349,1JN,3,NRSV,that the world hates you
9350,1JN,3,NRSV,we know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another whoever does not love abides in death
9351,1JN,3,NRSV,all who hate a brother or sister
9352,1JN,3,NRSV,are murderers and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them
9353,1JN,3,NRSV,we know love by this that he laid down his life for usand we ought to lay down our lives for one another
9354,1JN,3,NRSV,how does gods love abide in anyone who has the worlds goods and sees a brother or sister
9355,1JN,3,NRSV,in need and yet refuses help
9356,1JN,3,NRSV,little children let us love not in word or speech but in truth and action
9357,1JN,3,NRSV,and by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him
9358,1JN,3,NRSV,whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything
9359,1JN,3,NRSV,beloved if our hearts do not condemn us we have boldness before god
9360,1JN,3,NRSV,and we receive from him whatever we ask because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him
9361,1JN,3,NRSV,and this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he has commanded us
9362,1JN,3,NRSV,all who obey his commandments abide in him and he abides in them and by this we know that he abides in us by the spirit that he has given us
9363,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god for many false prophets have gone out into the world
9364,1JN,4,NRSV,by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god
9365,1JN,4,NRSV,and every spirit that does not confess jesus
9366,1JN,4,NRSV,is not from god and this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world
9367,1JN,4,NRSV,little children you are from god and have conquered them for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world
9368,1JN,4,NRSV,they are from the world therefore what they say is from the world and the world listens to them
9369,1JN,4,NRSV,we are from god whoever knows god listens to us and whoever is not from god does not listen to us from this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
9370,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved let us love one another because love is from god everyone who loves is born of god and knows god
9371,1JN,4,NRSV,whoever does not love does not know god for god is love
9372,1JN,4,NRSV,gods love was revealed among us in this way god sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him
9373,1JN,4,NRSV,in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins
9374,1JN,4,NRSV,beloved since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another
9375,1JN,4,NRSV,no one has ever seen god if we love one another god lives in us and his love is perfected in us
9376,1JN,4,NRSV,by this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit
9377,1JN,4,NRSV,and we have seen and do testify that the father has sent his son as the savior of the world
9378,1JN,4,NRSV,god abides in those who confess that jesus is the son of god and they abide in god
9379,1JN,4,NRSV,so we have known and believe the love that god has for us
9380,1JN,4,NRSV,god is love and those who abide in love abide in god and god abides in them
9381,1JN,4,NRSV,love has been perfected among us in this that we may have boldness on the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
9382,1JN,4,NRSV,there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love
9383,1JN,4,NRSV,we love
9384,1JN,4,NRSV,because he first loved us
9385,1JN,4,NRSV,those who say i love god and hate their brothers or sisters
9386,1JN,4,NRSV,are liars for those who do not love a brother or sister
9387,1JN,4,NRSV,whom they have seen cannot love god whom they have not seen
9388,1JN,4,NRSV,the commandment we have from him is this those who love god must love their brothers and sisters
9389,1JN,4,NRSV,also
9390,1JN,5,NRSV,everyone who believes that jesus is the christ
9391,1JN,5,NRSV,has been born of god and everyone who loves the parent loves the child
9392,1JN,5,NRSV,by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments
9393,1JN,5,NRSV,for the love of god is this that we obey his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome
9394,1JN,5,NRSV,for whatever is born of god conquers the world and this is the victory that conquers the world our faith
9395,1JN,5,NRSV,who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that jesus is the son of god
9396,1JN,5,NRSV,this is the one who came by water and blood jesus christ not with the water only but with the water and the blood and the spirit is the one that testifies for the spirit is the truth
9397,1JN,5,NRSV,there are three that testify
9398,1JN,5,NRSV,the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree
9399,1JN,5,NRSV,if we receive human testimony the testimony of god is greater for this is the testimony of god that he has testified to his son
9400,1JN,5,NRSV,those who believe in the son of god have the testimony in their hearts those who do not believe in god
9401,1JN,5,NRSV,have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that god has given concerning his son
9402,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the testimony god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son
9403,1JN,5,NRSV,whoever has the son has life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life
9404,1JN,5,NRSV,i write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life
9405,1JN,5,NRSV,and this is the boldness we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us
9406,1JN,5,NRSV,and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have obtained the requests made of him
9407,1JN,5,NRSV,if you see your brother or sister
9408,1JN,5,NRSV,committing what is not a mortal sin you will ask and god
9409,1JN,5,NRSV,will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal there is sin that is mortal i do not say that you should pray about that
9410,1JN,5,NRSV,all wrongdoing is sin but there is sin that is not mortal
9411,1JN,5,NRSV,we know that those who are born of god do not sin but the one who was born of god protects them and the evil one does not touch them
9412,1JN,5,NRSV,we know that we are gods children and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one
9413,1JN,5,NRSV,and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true
9414,1JN,5,NRSV,and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ he is the true god and eternal life
9415,1JN,5,NRSV,little children keep yourselves from idols
9416,2JN,1,NRSV,the elder to the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not only i but also all who know the truth
9417,2JN,1,NRSV,because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever
9418,2JN,1,NRSV,grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from
9419,2JN,1,NRSV,jesus christ the fathers son in truth and love
9420,2JN,1,NRSV,i was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth just as we have been commanded by the father
9421,2JN,1,NRSV,but now dear lady i ask you not as though i were writing you a new commandment but one we have had from the beginning let us love one another
9422,2JN,1,NRSV,and this is love that we walk according to his commandments this is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginningyou must walk in it
9423,2JN,1,NRSV,many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist
9424,2JN,1,NRSV,be on your guard so that you do not lose what we
9425,2JN,1,NRSV,have worked for but may receive a full reward
9426,2JN,1,NRSV,everyone who does not abide in the teaching of christ but goes beyond it does not have god whoever abides in the teaching has both the father and the son
9427,2JN,1,NRSV,do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching
9428,2JN,1,NRSV,for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person
9429,2JN,1,NRSV,although i have much to write to you i would rather not use paper and ink instead i hope to come to you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete
9430,2JN,1,NRSV,the children of your elect sister send you their greetings
9431,3JN,1,NRSV,the elder to the beloved gaius whom i love in truth
9432,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved i pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health just as it is well with your soul
9433,3JN,1,NRSV,i was overjoyed when some of the friends
9434,3JN,1,NRSV,arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth namely how you walk in the truth
9435,3JN,1,NRSV,i have no greater joy than this to hear that my children are walking in the truth
9436,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends
9437,3JN,1,NRSV,even though they are strangers to you
9438,3JN,1,NRSV,they have testified to your love before the church you will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of god
9439,3JN,1,NRSV,for they began their journey for the sake of christ
9440,3JN,1,NRSV,accepting no support from nonbelievers
9441,3JN,1,NRSV,therefore we ought to support such people so that we may become coworkers with the truth
9442,3JN,1,NRSV,i have written something to the church but diotrephes who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority
9443,3JN,1,NRSV,so if i come i will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us and not content with those charges he refuses to welcome the friends
9444,3JN,1,NRSV,and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from the church
9445,3JN,1,NRSV,beloved do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good whoever does good is from god whoever does evil has not seen god
9446,3JN,1,NRSV,everyone has testified favorably about demetrius and so has the truth itself we also testify for him
9447,3JN,1,NRSV,and you know that our testimony is true
9448,3JN,1,NRSV,i have much to write to you but i would rather not write with pen and ink
9449,3JN,1,NRSV,instead i hope to see you soon and we will talk together face to face
9450,3JN,1,NRSV,peace to you the friends send you their greetings greet the friends there each by name
9451,JUD,1,NRSV,jude
9452,JUD,1,NRSV,a servant
9453,JUD,1,NRSV,of jesus christ and brother of james
9454,JUD,1,NRSV,to those who are called who are beloved
9455,JUD,1,NRSV,in
9456,JUD,1,NRSV,god the father and kept safe for
9457,JUD,1,NRSV,jesus christ
9458,JUD,1,NRSV,may mercy peace and love be yours in abundance
9459,JUD,1,NRSV,beloved while eagerly preparing to write to you about the salvation we share i find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints
9460,JUD,1,NRSV,for certain intruders have stolen in among you people who long ago were designated for this condemnation as ungodly who pervert the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ
9461,JUD,1,NRSV,now i desire to remind you though you are fully informed that the lord who once for all saved
9462,JUD,1,NRSV,a people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe
9463,JUD,1,NRSV,and the angels who did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day
9464,JUD,1,NRSV,likewise sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding cities which in the same manner as they indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust
9465,JUD,1,NRSV,serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire
9466,JUD,1,NRSV,yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh reject authority and slander the glorious ones
9467,JUD,1,NRSV,but when the archangel michael contended with the devil and disputed about the body of moses he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander
9468,JUD,1,NRSV,against him but said the lord rebuke you
9469,JUD,1,NRSV,but these people slander whatever they do not understand and they are destroyed by those things that like irrational animals they know by instinct
9470,JUD,1,NRSV,woe to them for they go the way of cain and abandon themselves to balaams error for the sake of gain and perish in korahs rebellion
9471,JUD,1,NRSV,these are blemishes
9472,JUD,1,NRSV,on your lovefeasts while they feast with you without fear feeding themselves
9473,JUD,1,NRSV,they are waterless clouds carried along by the winds autumn trees without fruit twice dead uprooted
9474,JUD,1,NRSV,wild waves of the sea casting up the foam of their own shame wandering stars for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever
9475,JUD,1,NRSV,it was also about these that enoch in the seventh generation from adam prophesied saying see the lord is coming
9476,JUD,1,NRSV,with ten thousands of his holy ones
9477,JUD,1,NRSV,to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him
9478,JUD,1,NRSV,these are grumblers and malcontents they indulge their own lusts they are bombastic in speech flattering people to their own advantage
9479,JUD,1,NRSV,but you beloved must remember the predictions of the apostles of our lord jesus christ
9480,JUD,1,NRSV,for they said to you in the last time there will be scoffers indulging their own ungodly lusts
9481,JUD,1,NRSV,it is these worldly people devoid of the spirit who are causing divisions
9482,JUD,1,NRSV,but you beloved build yourselves up on your most holy faith pray in the holy spirit
9483,JUD,1,NRSV,keep yourselves in the love of god look forward to the mercy of our lord jesus christ that leads to
9484,JUD,1,NRSV,eternal life
9485,JUD,1,NRSV,and have mercy on some who are wavering
9486,JUD,1,NRSV,save others by snatching them out of the fire and have mercy on still others with fear hating even the tunic defiled by their bodies
9487,JUD,1,NRSV,now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to make you stand without blemish in the presence of his glory with rejoicing
9488,JUD,1,NRSV,to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord be glory majesty power and authority before all time and now and forever amen
9489,REV,1,NRSV,the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants
9490,REV,1,NRSV,what must soon take place he made
9491,REV,1,NRSV,it known by sending his angel to his servant
9492,REV,1,NRSV,john
9493,REV,1,NRSV,who testified to the word of god and to the testimony of jesus christ even to all that he saw
9494,REV,1,NRSV,blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy and blessed are those who hear and who keep what is written in it for the time is near
9495,REV,1,NRSV,john to the seven churches that are in asia
9496,REV,1,NRSV,grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits who are before his throne
9497,REV,1,NRSV,and from jesus christ the faithful witness the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth
9498,REV,1,NRSV,to him who loves us and freed
9499,REV,1,NRSV,us from our sins by his blood
9500,REV,1,NRSV,and made
9501,REV,1,NRSV,us to be a kingdom priests serving
9502,REV,1,NRSV,his god and father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen
9503,REV,1,NRSV,look he is coming with the clouds
9504,REV,1,NRSV,every eye will see him
9505,REV,1,NRSV,even those who pierced him
9506,REV,1,NRSV,and on his account all the tribes of the earth will wail
9507,REV,1,NRSV,so it is to be amen
9508,REV,1,NRSV,i am the alpha and the omega says the lord god who is and who was and who is to come the almighty
9509,REV,1,NRSV,i john your brother who share with you in jesus the persecution and the kingdom and the patient endurance was on the island called patmos because of the word of god and the testimony of jesus
9510,REV,1,NRSV,i was in the spirit
9511,REV,1,NRSV,on the lords day and i heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
9512,REV,1,NRSV,saying write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches to ephesus to smyrna to pergamum to thyatira to sardis to philadelphia and to laodicea
9513,REV,1,NRSV,then i turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me and on turning i saw seven golden lampstands
9514,REV,1,NRSV,and in the midst of the lampstands i saw one like the son of man clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest
9515,REV,1,NRSV,his head and his hair were white as white wool white as snow his eyes were like a flame of fire
9516,REV,1,NRSV,his feet were like burnished bronze refined as in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of many waters
9517,REV,1,NRSV,in his right hand he held seven stars and from his mouth came a sharp twoedged sword and his face was like the sun shining with full force
9518,REV,1,NRSV,when i saw him i fell at his feet as though dead but he placed his right hand on me saying do not be afraid i am the first and the last
9519,REV,1,NRSV,and the living one i was dead and see i am alive forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of hades
9520,REV,1,NRSV,now write what you have seen what is and what is to take place after this
9521,REV,1,NRSV,as for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches
9522,REV,2,NRSV,to the angel of the church in ephesus write these are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand who walks among the seven golden lampstands
9523,REV,2,NRSV,i know your works your toil and your patient endurance i know that you cannot tolerate evildoers you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them to be false
9524,REV,2,NRSV,i also know that you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake of my name and that you have not grown weary
9525,REV,2,NRSV,but i have this against you that you have abandoned the love you had at first
9526,REV,2,NRSV,remember then from what you have fallen repent and do the works you did at first if not i will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent
9527,REV,2,NRSV,yet this is to your credit you hate the works of the nicolaitans which i also hate
9528,REV,2,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches to everyone who conquers i will give permission to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of god
9529,REV,2,NRSV,and to the angel of the church in smyrna write these are the words of the first and the last who was dead and came to life
9530,REV,2,NRSV,i know your affliction and your poverty even though you are rich i know the slander on the part of those who say that they are jews and are not but are a synagogue of satan
9531,REV,2,NRSV,do not fear what you are about to suffer beware the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested and for ten days you will have affliction be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life
9532,REV,2,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches whoever conquers will not be harmed by the second death
9533,REV,2,NRSV,and to the angel of the church in pergamum write these are the words of him who has the sharp twoedged sword
9534,REV,2,NRSV,i know where you are living where satans throne is yet you are holding fast to my name and you did not deny your faith in me
9535,REV,2,NRSV,even in the days of antipas my witness my faithful one who was killed among you where satan lives
9536,REV,2,NRSV,but i have a few things against you you have some there who hold to the teaching of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the people of israel so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice fornication
9537,REV,2,NRSV,so you also have some who hold to the teaching of the nicolaitans
9538,REV,2,NRSV,repent then if not i will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth
9539,REV,2,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches to everyone who conquers i will give some of the hidden manna and i will give a white stone and on the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it
9540,REV,2,NRSV,and to the angel of the church in thyatira write these are the words of the son of god who has eyes like a flame of fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze
9541,REV,2,NRSV,i know your worksyour love faith service and patient endurance i know that your last works are greater than the first
9542,REV,2,NRSV,but i have this against you you tolerate that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophet and is teaching and beguiling my servants
9543,REV,2,NRSV,to practice fornication and to eat food sacrificed to idols
9544,REV,2,NRSV,i gave her time to repent but she refuses to repent of her fornication
9545,REV,2,NRSV,beware i am throwing her on a bed and those who commit adultery with her i am throwing into great distress unless they repent of her doings
9546,REV,2,NRSV,and i will strike her children dead and all the churches will know that i am the one who searches minds and hearts and i will give to each of you as your works deserve
9547,REV,2,NRSV,but to the rest of you in thyatira who do not hold this teaching who have not learned what some call the deep things of satan to you i say i do not lay on you any other burden
9548,REV,2,NRSV,only hold fast to what you have until i come
9549,REV,2,NRSV,to everyone who conquers and continues to do my works to the end
9550,REV,2,NRSV,i will give authority over the nations
9551,REV,2,NRSV,to rule
9552,REV,2,NRSV,them with an iron rod
9553,REV,2,NRSV,as when clay pots are shattered
9554,REV,2,NRSV,even as i also received authority from my father to the one who conquers i will also give the morning star
9555,REV,2,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches
9556,REV,3,NRSV,and to the angel of the church in sardis write these are the words of him who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars
9557,REV,3,NRSV,i know your works you have a name of being alive but you are dead
9558,REV,3,NRSV,wake up and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death for i have not found your works perfect in the sight of my god
9559,REV,3,NRSV,remember then what you received and heard obey it and repent if you do not wake up i will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour i will come to you
9560,REV,3,NRSV,yet you have still a few persons in sardis who have not soiled their clothes they will walk with me dressed in white for they are worthy
9561,REV,3,NRSV,if you conquer you will be clothed like them in white robes and i will not blot your name out of the book of life i will confess your name before my father and before his angels
9562,REV,3,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches
9563,REV,3,NRSV,and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write
9564,REV,3,NRSV,these are the words of the holy one the true one
9565,REV,3,NRSV,who has the key of david
9566,REV,3,NRSV,who opens and no one will shut
9567,REV,3,NRSV,who shuts and no one opens

9574,REV,3,NRSV,and to the angel of the church in laodicea write the words of the amen the faithful and true witness the origin

9576,REV,3,NRSV,i know your works you are neither cold nor hot i wish that you were either cold or hot

9582,REV,3,NRSV,to the one who conquers i will give a place with me on my throne just as i myself conquered and sat down with my father on his throne
9583,REV,3,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches
9584,REV,4,NRSV,after this i looked and there in heaven a door stood open and the first voice which i had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said come up here and i will show you what must take place after this
9585,REV,4,NRSV,at once i was in the spirit
9586,REV,4,NRSV,and there in heaven stood a throne with one seated on the throne
9587,REV,4,NRSV,and the one seated there looks like jasper and carnelian and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald
9588,REV,4,NRSV,around the throne are twentyfour thrones and seated on the thrones are twentyfour elders dressed in white robes with golden crowns on their heads
9589,REV,4,NRSV,coming from the throne are flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches which are the seven spirits of god
9590,REV,4,NRSV,and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass like crystal
9591,REV,4,NRSV,around the throne and on each side of the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind
9592,REV,4,NRSV,the first living creature like a lion the second living creature like an ox the third living creature with a face like a human face and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle
9593,REV,4,NRSV,and the four living creatures each of them with six wings are full of eyes all around and inside day and night without ceasing they sing
9594,REV,4,NRSV,holy holy holy
9595,REV,4,NRSV,the lord god the almighty
9596,REV,4,NRSV,who was and is and is to come
9597,REV,4,NRSV,and whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne who lives forever and ever
9598,REV,4,NRSV,the twentyfour elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever they cast their crowns before the throne singing
9599,REV,4,NRSV,you are worthy our lord and god
9600,REV,4,NRSV,to receive glory and honor and power
9601,REV,4,NRSV,for you created all things
9602,REV,4,NRSV,and by your will they existed and were created
9603,REV,5,NRSV,then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back sealed
9604,REV,5,NRSV,with seven seals
9605,REV,5,NRSV,and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals
9606,REV,5,NRSV,and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it
9607,REV,5,NRSV,and i began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it
9608,REV,5,NRSV,then one of the elders said to me do not weep see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals
9609,REV,5,NRSV,then i saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth
9610,REV,5,NRSV,he went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne
9611,REV,5,NRSV,when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints
9612,REV,5,NRSV,they sing a new song
9613,REV,5,NRSV,you are worthy to take the scroll
9614,REV,5,NRSV,and to open its seals
9615,REV,5,NRSV,for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for god
9616,REV,5,NRSV,saints from
9617,REV,5,NRSV,every tribe and language and people and nation
9618,REV,5,NRSV,you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving
9619,REV,5,NRSV,our god
9620,REV,5,NRSV,and they will reign on earth
9621,REV,5,NRSV,then i looked and i heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands
9622,REV,5,NRSV,singing with full voice
9623,REV,5,NRSV,worthy is the lamb that was slaughtered
9624,REV,5,NRSV,to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might
9625,REV,5,NRSV,and honor and glory and blessing
9626,REV,5,NRSV,then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them singing
9627,REV,5,NRSV,to the one seated on the throne and to the lamb
9628,REV,5,NRSV,be blessing and honor and glory and might
9629,REV,5,NRSV,forever and ever
9630,REV,5,NRSV,and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped
9631,REV,6,NRSV,then i saw the lamb open one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures call out as with a voice of thunder come
9632,REV,6,NRSV,i looked and there was a white horse its rider had a bow a crown was given to him and he came out conquering and to conquer
9633,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature call out come
9634,REV,6,NRSV,and out came
9635,REV,6,NRSV,another horse bright red its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth so that people would slaughter one another and he was given a great sword
9636,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the third seal i heard the third living creature call out come
9637,REV,6,NRSV,i looked and there was a black horse its rider held a pair of scales in his hand
9638,REV,6,NRSV,and i heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for a days pay
9639,REV,6,NRSV,and three quarts of barley for a days pay
9640,REV,6,NRSV,but do not damage the olive oil and the wine
9641,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature call out come
9642,REV,6,NRSV,i looked and there was a pale green horse its riders name was death and hades followed with him they were given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword famine and pestilence and by the wild animals of the earth
9643,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the word of god and for the testimony they had given
9644,REV,6,NRSV,they cried out with a loud voice sovereign lord holy and true how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth
9645,REV,6,NRSV,they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer until the number would be complete both of their fellow servants
9646,REV,6,NRSV,and of their brothers and sisters
9647,REV,6,NRSV,who were soon to be killed as they themselves had been killed
9648,REV,6,NRSV,when he opened the sixth seal i looked and there came a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood
9649,REV,6,NRSV,and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale
9650,REV,6,NRSV,the sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up and every mountain and island was removed from its place
9651,REV,6,NRSV,then the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the rich and the powerful and everyone slave and free hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains
9652,REV,6,NRSV,calling to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb
9653,REV,6,NRSV,for the great day of their wrath has come and who is able to stand
9654,REV,7,NRSV,after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth or sea or against any tree
9655,REV,7,NRSV,i saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun having the seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea
9656,REV,7,NRSV,saying do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have marked the servants
9657,REV,7,NRSV,of our god with a seal on their foreheads
9658,REV,7,NRSV,and i heard the number of those who were sealed one hundred fortyfour thousand sealed out of every tribe of the people of israel
9659,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of judah twelve thousand sealed
9660,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand
9661,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of gad twelve thousand
9662,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of asher twelve thousand
9663,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand
9664,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand
9665,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand
9666,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of levi twelve thousand
9667,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of issachar twelve thousand
9668,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand
9669,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand
9670,REV,7,NRSV,from the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand sealed
9671,REV,7,NRSV,after this i looked and there was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation from all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and before the lamb robed in white with palm branches in their hands
9672,REV,7,NRSV,they cried out in a loud voice saying
9673,REV,7,NRSV,salvation belongs to our god who is seated on the throne and to the lamb
9674,REV,7,NRSV,and all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped god
9675,REV,7,NRSV,singing
9676,REV,7,NRSV,amen blessing and glory and wisdom
9677,REV,7,NRSV,and thanksgiving and honor
9678,REV,7,NRSV,and power and might
9679,REV,7,NRSV,be to our god forever and ever amen
9680,REV,7,NRSV,then one of the elders addressed me saying who are these robed in white and where have they come from
9681,REV,7,NRSV,i said to him sir you are the one that knows then he said to me these are they who have come out of the great ordeal they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
9682,REV,7,NRSV,for this reason they are before the throne of god
9683,REV,7,NRSV,and worship him day and night within his temple
9684,REV,7,NRSV,and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them
9685,REV,7,NRSV,they will hunger no more and thirst no more
9686,REV,7,NRSV,the sun will not strike them
9687,REV,7,NRSV,nor any scorching heat
9688,REV,7,NRSV,for the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd
9689,REV,7,NRSV,and he will guide them to springs of the water of life
9690,REV,7,NRSV,and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes
9691,REV,8,NRSV,when the lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour
9692,REV,8,NRSV,and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and seven trumpets were given to them
9693,REV,8,NRSV,another angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar he was given a great quantity of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that is before the throne
9694,REV,8,NRSV,and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose before god from the hand of the angel
9695,REV,8,NRSV,then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth and there were peals of thunder rumblings flashes of lightning and an earthquake
9696,REV,8,NRSV,now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them
9697,REV,8,NRSV,the first angel blew his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and they were hurled to the earth and a third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up
9698,REV,8,NRSV,the second angel blew his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea
9699,REV,8,NRSV,a third of the sea became blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed
9700,REV,8,NRSV,the third angel blew his trumpet and a great star fell from heaven blazing like a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water
9701,REV,8,NRSV,the name of the star is wormwood a third of the waters became wormwood and many died from the water because it was made bitter
9702,REV,8,NRSV,the fourth angel blew his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of their light was darkened a third of the day was kept from shining and likewise the night
9703,REV,8,NRSV,then i looked and i heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew in midheaven woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow
9704,REV,9,NRSV,and the fifth angel blew his trumpet and i saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit
9705,REV,9,NRSV,he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft
9706,REV,9,NRSV,then from the smoke came locusts on the earth and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth
9707,REV,9,NRSV,they were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree but only those people who do not have the seal of god on their foreheads
9708,REV,9,NRSV,they were allowed to torture them for five months but not to kill them and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone
9709,REV,9,NRSV,and in those days people will seek death but will not find it they will long to die but death will flee from them
9710,REV,9,NRSV,in appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold their faces were like human faces
9711,REV,9,NRSV,their hair like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth
9712,REV,9,NRSV,they had scales like iron breastplates and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle
9713,REV,9,NRSV,they have tails like scorpions with stingers and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months
9714,REV,9,NRSV,they have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit his name in hebrew is abaddon
9715,REV,9,NRSV,and in greek he is called apollyon
9716,REV,9,NRSV,the first woe has passed there are still two woes to come
9717,REV,9,NRSV,then the sixth angel blew his trumpet and i heard a voice from the four
9718,REV,9,NRSV,horns of the golden altar before god
9719,REV,9,NRSV,saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates
9720,REV,9,NRSV,so the four angels were released who had been held ready for the hour the day the month and the year to kill a third of humankind
9721,REV,9,NRSV,the number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million i heard their number
9722,REV,9,NRSV,and this was how i saw the horses in my vision the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire
9723,REV,9,NRSV,and of sulfur the heads of the horses were like lions heads and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths
9724,REV,9,NRSV,by these three plagues a third of humankind was killed by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths
9725,REV,9,NRSV,for the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails their tails are like serpents having heads and with them they inflict harm
9726,REV,9,NRSV,the rest of humankind who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood which cannot see or hear or walk
9727,REV,9,NRSV,and they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts
9728,REV,10,NRSV,and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire
9729,REV,10,NRSV,he held a little scroll open in his hand setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land
9730,REV,10,NRSV,he gave a great shout like a lion roaring and when he shouted the seven thunders sounded
9731,REV,10,NRSV,and when the seven thunders had sounded i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down
9732,REV,10,NRSV,then the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and the land
9733,REV,10,NRSV,raised his right hand to heaven
9734,REV,10,NRSV,and swore by him who lives forever and ever
9735,REV,10,NRSV,who created heaven and what is in it the earth and what is in it and the sea and what is in it there will be no more delay
9736,REV,10,NRSV,but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet the mystery of god will be fulfilled as he announced to his servants
9737,REV,10,NRSV,the prophets
9738,REV,10,NRSV,then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land
9739,REV,10,NRSV,so i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll and he said to me take it and eat it will be bitter to your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth
9740,REV,10,NRSV,so i took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it it was sweet as honey in my mouth but when i had eaten it my stomach was made bitter
9741,REV,10,NRSV,then they said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings
9742,REV,11,NRSV,then i was given a measuring rod like a staff and i was told come and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship there
9743,REV,11,NRSV,but do not measure the court outside the temple leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months
9744,REV,11,NRSV,and i will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days wearing sackcloth
9745,REV,11,NRSV,these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth
9746,REV,11,NRSV,and if anyone wants to harm them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner
9747,REV,11,NRSV,they have authority to shut the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire
9748,REV,11,NRSV,when they have finished their testimony the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them
9749,REV,11,NRSV,and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically
9750,REV,11,NRSV,called sodom and egypt where also their lord was crucified
9751,REV,11,NRSV,for three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb
9752,REV,11,NRSV,and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth
9753,REV,11,NRSV,but after the three and a half days the breath
9754,REV,11,NRSV,of life from god entered them and they stood on their feet and those who saw them were terrified
9755,REV,11,NRSV,then they
9756,REV,11,NRSV,heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them come up here and they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them
9757,REV,11,NRSV,at that moment there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the god of heaven
9758,REV,11,NRSV,the second woe has passed the third woe is coming very soon
9759,REV,11,NRSV,then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying
9760,REV,11,NRSV,the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord
9761,REV,11,NRSV,and of his messiah
9762,REV,11,NRSV,and he will reign forever and ever
9763,REV,11,NRSV,then the twentyfour elders who sit on their thrones before god fell on their faces and worshiped god
9764,REV,11,NRSV,singing
9765,REV,11,NRSV,we give you thanks lord god almighty
9766,REV,11,NRSV,who are and who were
9767,REV,11,NRSV,for you have taken your great power
9768,REV,11,NRSV,and begun to reign
9769,REV,11,NRSV,the nations raged
9770,REV,11,NRSV,but your wrath has come
9771,REV,11,NRSV,and the time for judging the dead
9772,REV,11,NRSV,for rewarding your servants
9773,REV,11,NRSV,the prophets
9774,REV,11,NRSV,and saints and all who fear your name
9775,REV,11,NRSV,both small and great
9776,REV,11,NRSV,and for destroying those who destroy the earth
9777,REV,11,NRSV,then gods temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple and there were flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder an earthquake and heavy hail
9778,REV,12,NRSV,a great portent appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
9779,REV,12,NRSV,she was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs in the agony of giving birth
9780,REV,12,NRSV,then another portent appeared in heaven a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems on his heads
9781,REV,12,NRSV,his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born
9782,REV,12,NRSV,and she gave birth to a son a male child who is to rule
9783,REV,12,NRSV,all the nations with a rod of iron but her child was snatched away and taken to god and to his throne
9784,REV,12,NRSV,and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty days
9785,REV,12,NRSV,and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon and his angels fought back
9786,REV,12,NRSV,but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven
9787,REV,12,NRSV,the great dragon was thrown down that ancient serpent who is called the devil and satan the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him
9788,REV,12,NRSV,then i heard a loud voice in heaven proclaiming
9789,REV,12,NRSV,now have come the salvation and the power
9790,REV,12,NRSV,and the kingdom of our god
9791,REV,12,NRSV,and the authority of his messiah
9792,REV,12,NRSV,for the accuser of our comrades
9793,REV,12,NRSV,has been thrown down
9794,REV,12,NRSV,who accuses them day and night before our god
9795,REV,12,NRSV,but they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb
9796,REV,12,NRSV,and by the word of their testimony
9797,REV,12,NRSV,for they did not cling to life even in the face of death
9798,REV,12,NRSV,rejoice then you heavens
9799,REV,12,NRSV,and those who dwell in them
9800,REV,12,NRSV,but woe to the earth and the sea
9801,REV,12,NRSV,for the devil has come down to you
9802,REV,12,NRSV,with great wrath
9803,REV,12,NRSV,because he knows that his time is short
9804,REV,12,NRSV,so when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth he pursued
9805,REV,12,NRSV,the woman who had given birth to the male child
9806,REV,12,NRSV,but the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness to her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time
9807,REV,12,NRSV,then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a river after the woman to sweep her away with the flood
9808,REV,12,NRSV,but the earth came to the help of the woman it opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth
9809,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon was angry with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her children those who keep the commandments of god and hold the testimony of jesus
9810,REV,12,NRSV,then the dragon
9811,REV,12,NRSV,took his stand on the sand of the seashore
9812,REV,13,NRSV,and i saw a beast rising out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on its horns were ten diadems and on its heads were blasphemous names
9813,REV,13,NRSV,and the beast that i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears and its mouth was like a lions mouth and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority
9814,REV,13,NRSV,one of its heads seemed to have received a deathblow but its mortal wound
9815,REV,13,NRSV,had been healed in amazement the whole earth followed the beast
9816,REV,13,NRSV,they worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it
9817,REV,13,NRSV,the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for fortytwo months
9818,REV,13,NRSV,it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his dwelling that is those who dwell in heaven
9819,REV,13,NRSV,also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them
9820,REV,13,NRSV,it was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation
9821,REV,13,NRSV,and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that was slaughtered
9822,REV,13,NRSV,let anyone who has an ear listen
9823,REV,13,NRSV,if you are to be taken captive
9824,REV,13,NRSV,into captivity you go
9825,REV,13,NRSV,if you kill with the sword
9826,REV,13,NRSV,with the sword you must be killed
9827,REV,13,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints
9828,REV,13,NRSV,then i saw another beast that rose out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon
9829,REV,13,NRSV,it exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound
9830,REV,13,NRSV,had been healed
9831,REV,13,NRSV,it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all
9832,REV,13,NRSV,and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast it deceives the inhabitants of earth telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword
9833,REV,13,NRSV,and yet lived
9834,REV,13,NRSV,and it was allowed to give breath
9835,REV,13,NRSV,to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed
9836,REV,13,NRSV,also it causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or the forehead
9837,REV,13,NRSV,so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name
9838,REV,13,NRSV,this calls for wisdom let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a person its number is six hundred sixtysix
9839,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him were one hundred fortyfour thousand who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads
9840,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder the voice i heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps
9841,REV,14,NRSV,and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders no one could learn that song except the one hundred fortyfour thousand who have been redeemed from the earth
9842,REV,14,NRSV,it is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are virgins these follow the lamb wherever he goes they have been redeemed from humankind as first fruits for god and the lamb
9843,REV,14,NRSV,and in their mouth no lie was found they are blameless
9844,REV,14,NRSV,then i saw another angel flying in midheaven with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live
9845,REV,14,NRSV,on the earthto every nation and tribe and language and people
9846,REV,14,NRSV,he said in a loud voice fear god and give him glory for the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made heaven and earth the sea and the springs of water
9847,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a second followed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication
9848,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel a third followed them crying with a loud voice those who worship the beast and its image and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands
9849,REV,14,NRSV,they will also drink the wine of gods wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
9850,REV,14,NRSV,and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name
9851,REV,14,NRSV,here is a call for the endurance of the saints those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of
9852,REV,14,NRSV,jesus
9853,REV,14,NRSV,and i heard a voice from heaven saying write this blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord yes says the spirit they will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them
9854,REV,14,NRSV,then i looked and there was a white cloud and seated on the cloud was one like the son of man with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand
9855,REV,14,NRSV,another angel came out of the temple calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud use your sickle and reap for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe
9856,REV,14,NRSV,so the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped
9857,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel came out of the temple in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle
9858,REV,14,NRSV,then another angel came out from the altar the angel who has authority over fire and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for its grapes are ripe
9859,REV,14,NRSV,so the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of god
9860,REV,14,NRSV,and the wine press was trodden outside the city and blood flowed from the wine press as high as a horses bridle for a distance of about two hundred miles
9861,REV,15,NRSV,then i saw another portent in heaven great and amazing seven angels with seven plagues which are the last for with them the wrath of god is ended
9862,REV,15,NRSV,and i saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name standing beside the sea of glass with harps of god in their hands
9863,REV,15,NRSV,and they sing the song of moses the servant
9864,REV,15,NRSV,of god and the song of the lamb
9865,REV,15,NRSV,great and amazing are your deeds
9866,REV,15,NRSV,lord god the almighty
9867,REV,15,NRSV,just and true are your ways
9868,REV,15,NRSV,king of the nations
9869,REV,15,NRSV,lord who will not fear
9870,REV,15,NRSV,and glorify your name
9871,REV,15,NRSV,for you alone are holy
9872,REV,15,NRSV,all nations will come
9873,REV,15,NRSV,and worship before you
9874,REV,15,NRSV,for your judgments have been revealed
9875,REV,15,NRSV,after this i looked and the temple of the tent
9876,REV,15,NRSV,of witness in heaven was opened
9877,REV,15,NRSV,and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues robed in pure bright linen
9878,REV,15,NRSV,with golden sashes across their chests
9879,REV,15,NRSV,then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who lives forever and ever
9880,REV,15,NRSV,and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended
9881,REV,16,NRSV,then i heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of god
9882,REV,16,NRSV,so the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth and a foul and painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image
9883,REV,16,NRSV,the second angel poured his bowl into the sea and it became like the blood of a corpse and every living thing in the sea died
9884,REV,16,NRSV,the third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water and they became blood
9885,REV,16,NRSV,and i heard the angel of the waters say
9886,REV,16,NRSV,you are just o holy one who are and were
9887,REV,16,NRSV,for you have judged these things
9888,REV,16,NRSV,because they shed the blood of saints and prophets
9889,REV,16,NRSV,you have given them blood to drink
9890,REV,16,NRSV,it is what they deserve
9891,REV,16,NRSV,and i heard the altar respond
9892,REV,16,NRSV,yes o lord god the almighty
9893,REV,16,NRSV,your judgments are true and just
9894,REV,16,NRSV,the fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun and it was allowed to scorch them with fire
9895,REV,16,NRSV,they were scorched by the fierce heat but they cursed the name of god who had authority over these plagues and they did not repent and give him glory
9896,REV,16,NRSV,the fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast and its kingdom was plunged into darkness people gnawed their tongues in agony
9897,REV,16,NRSV,and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and sores and they did not repent of their deeds
9898,REV,16,NRSV,the sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east
9899,REV,16,NRSV,and i saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet
9900,REV,16,NRSV,these are demonic spirits performing signs who go abroad to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for battle on the great day of god the almighty
9901,REV,16,NRSV,see i am coming like a thief blessed is the one who stays awake and is clothed
9902,REV,16,NRSV,not going about naked and exposed to shame
9903,REV,16,NRSV,and they assembled them at the place that in hebrew is called harmagedon
9904,REV,16,NRSV,the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done
9905,REV,16,NRSV,and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a violent earthquake such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth so violent was that earthquake
9906,REV,16,NRSV,the great city was split into three parts and the cities of the nations fell god remembered great babylon and gave her the winecup of the fury of his wrath
9907,REV,16,NRSV,and every island fled away and no mountains were to be found
9908,REV,16,NRSV,and huge hailstones each weighing about a hundred pounds
9909,REV,16,NRSV,dropped from heaven on people until they cursed god for the plague of the hail so fearful was that plague
9910,REV,17,NRSV,then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me come i will show you the judgment of the great whore who is seated on many waters
9911,REV,17,NRSV,with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and with the wine of whose fornication the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk
9912,REV,17,NRSV,so he carried me away in the spirit
9913,REV,17,NRSV,into a wilderness and i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and it had seven heads and ten horns
9914,REV,17,NRSV,the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication
9915,REV,17,NRSV,and on her forehead was written a name a mystery babylon the great mother of whores and of earths abominations
9916,REV,17,NRSV,and i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to jesus
9917,REV,17,NRSV,when i saw her i was greatly amazed
9918,REV,17,NRSV,but the angel said to me why are you so amazed i will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her
9919,REV,17,NRSV,the beast that you saw was and is not and is about to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to destruction and the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be amazed when they see the beast because it was and is not and is to come
9920,REV,17,NRSV,this calls for a mind that has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated also they are seven kings
9921,REV,17,NRSV,of whom five have fallen one is living and the other has not yet come and when he comes he must remain only a little while
9922,REV,17,NRSV,as for the beast that was and is not it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven and it goes to destruction
9923,REV,17,NRSV,and the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour together with the beast
9924,REV,17,NRSV,these are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast
9925,REV,17,NRSV,they will make war on the lamb and the lamb will conquer them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those with him are called and chosen and faithful
9926,REV,17,NRSV,and he said to me the waters that you saw where the whore is seated are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages
9927,REV,17,NRSV,and the ten horns that you saw they and the beast will hate the whore they will make her desolate and naked they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire
9928,REV,17,NRSV,for god has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of god will be fulfilled
9929,REV,17,NRSV,the woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth
9930,REV,18,NRSV,after this i saw another angel coming down from heaven having great authority and the earth was made bright with his splendor
9931,REV,18,NRSV,he called out with a mighty voice
9932,REV,18,NRSV,fallen fallen is babylon the great
9933,REV,18,NRSV,it has become a dwelling place of demons
9934,REV,18,NRSV,a haunt of every foul spirit
9935,REV,18,NRSV,a haunt of every foul bird
9936,REV,18,NRSV,a haunt of every foul and hateful beast
9937,REV,18,NRSV,for all the nations have drunk
9938,REV,18,NRSV,of the wine of the wrath of her fornication
9939,REV,18,NRSV,and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her
9940,REV,18,NRSV,and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power
9941,REV,18,NRSV,of her luxury
9942,REV,18,NRSV,then i heard another voice from heaven saying
9943,REV,18,NRSV,come out of her my people
9944,REV,18,NRSV,so that you do not take part in her sins
9945,REV,18,NRSV,and so that you do not share
9946,REV,18,NRSV,in her plagues
9947,REV,18,NRSV,for her sins are heaped high as heaven
9948,REV,18,NRSV,and god has remembered her iniquities
9949,REV,18,NRSV,render to her as she herself has rendered
9950,REV,18,NRSV,and repay her double for her deeds
9951,REV,18,NRSV,mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed
9952,REV,18,NRSV,as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously
9953,REV,18,NRSV,so give her a like measure of torment and grief
9954,REV,18,NRSV,since in her heart she says
9955,REV,18,NRSV,i rule as a queen
9956,REV,18,NRSV,i am no widow
9957,REV,18,NRSV,and i will never see grief
9958,REV,18,NRSV,therefore her plagues will come in a single day
9959,REV,18,NRSV,pestilence and mourning and famine
9960,REV,18,NRSV,and she will be burned with fire
9961,REV,18,NRSV,for mighty is the lord god who judges her
9962,REV,18,NRSV,and the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning
9963,REV,18,NRSV,they will stand far off in fear of her torment and say
9964,REV,18,NRSV,alas alas the great city
9965,REV,18,NRSV,babylon the mighty city
9966,REV,18,NRSV,for in one hour your judgment has come
9967,REV,18,NRSV,and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one buys their cargo anymore
9968,REV,18,NRSV,cargo of gold silver jewels and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet all kinds of scented wood all articles of ivory all articles of costly wood bronze iron and marble
9969,REV,18,NRSV,cinnamon spice incense myrrh frankincense wine olive oil choice flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and chariots slavesand human lives
9970,REV,18,NRSV,the fruit for which your soul longed
9971,REV,18,NRSV,has gone from you
9972,REV,18,NRSV,and all your dainties and your splendor
9973,REV,18,NRSV,are lost to you
9974,REV,18,NRSV,never to be found again
9975,REV,18,NRSV,the merchants of these wares who gained wealth from her will stand far off in fear of her torment weeping and mourning aloud
9976,REV,18,NRSV,alas alas the great city
9977,REV,18,NRSV,clothed in fine linen
9978,REV,18,NRSV,in purple and scarlet
9979,REV,18,NRSV,adorned with gold
9980,REV,18,NRSV,with jewels and with pearls
9981,REV,18,NRSV,for in one hour all this wealth has been laid waste
9982,REV,18,NRSV,and all shipmasters and seafarers sailors and all whose trade is on the sea stood far off
9983,REV,18,NRSV,and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning
9984,REV,18,NRSV,what city was like the great city
9985,REV,18,NRSV,and they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned crying out
9986,REV,18,NRSV,alas alas the great city
9987,REV,18,NRSV,where all who had ships at sea
9988,REV,18,NRSV,grew rich by her wealth
9989,REV,18,NRSV,for in one hour she has been laid waste
9990,REV,18,NRSV,rejoice over her o heaven
9991,REV,18,NRSV,you saints and apostles and prophets
9992,REV,18,NRSV,for god has given judgment for you against her
9993,REV,18,NRSV,then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying
9994,REV,18,NRSV,with such violence babylon the great city
9995,REV,18,NRSV,will be thrown down
9996,REV,18,NRSV,and will be found no more
9997,REV,18,NRSV,and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters
9998,REV,18,NRSV,will be heard in you no more
9999,REV,18,NRSV,and an artisan of any trade
10000,REV,18,NRSV,will be found in you no more
10001,REV,18,NRSV,and the sound of the millstone
10002,REV,18,NRSV,will be heard in you no more
10003,REV,18,NRSV,and the light of a lamp
10004,REV,18,NRSV,will shine in you no more
10005,REV,18,NRSV,and the voice of bridegroom and bride
10006,REV,18,NRSV,will be heard in you no more
10007,REV,18,NRSV,for your merchants were the magnates of the earth
10008,REV,18,NRSV,and all nations were deceived by your sorcery
10009,REV,18,NRSV,and in you
10010,REV,18,NRSV,was found the blood of prophets and of saints
10011,REV,18,NRSV,and of all who have been slaughtered on earth
10012,REV,19,NRSV,after this i heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven saying
10013,REV,19,NRSV,hallelujah
10014,REV,19,NRSV,salvation and glory and power to our god
10015,REV,19,NRSV,for his judgments are true and just
10016,REV,19,NRSV,he has judged the great whore
10017,REV,19,NRSV,who corrupted the earth with her fornication
10018,REV,19,NRSV,and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants
10019,REV,19,NRSV,once more they said
10020,REV,19,NRSV,hallelujah
10021,REV,19,NRSV,the smoke goes up from her forever and ever
10022,REV,19,NRSV,and the twentyfour elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who is seated on the throne saying
10023,REV,19,NRSV,amen hallelujah
10024,REV,19,NRSV,and from the throne came a voice saying
10025,REV,19,NRSV,praise our god
10026,REV,19,NRSV,all you his servants
10027,REV,19,NRSV,and all who fear him
10028,REV,19,NRSV,small and great
10029,REV,19,NRSV,then i heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals crying out
10030,REV,19,NRSV,hallelujah
10031,REV,19,NRSV,for the lord our god
10032,REV,19,NRSV,the almighty reigns
10033,REV,19,NRSV,let us rejoice and exult
10034,REV,19,NRSV,and give him the glory
10035,REV,19,NRSV,for the marriage of the lamb has come
10036,REV,19,NRSV,and his bride has made herself ready
10037,REV,19,NRSV,to her it has been granted to be clothed
10038,REV,19,NRSV,with fine linen bright and pure
10039,REV,19,NRSV,for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints
10040,REV,19,NRSV,and the angel said
10041,REV,19,NRSV,to me write this blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said to me these are true words of god
10042,REV,19,NRSV,then i fell down at his feet to worship him but he said to me you must not do that i am a fellow servant
10043,REV,19,NRSV,with you and your comrades
10044,REV,19,NRSV,who hold the testimony of jesus
10045,REV,19,NRSV,worship god for the testimony of jesus
10046,REV,19,NRSV,is the spirit of prophecy
10047,REV,19,NRSV,then i saw heaven opened and there was a white horse its rider is called faithful and true and in righteousness he judges and makes war
10048,REV,19,NRSV,his eyes are like a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems and he has a name inscribed that no one knows but himself
10049,REV,19,NRSV,he is clothed in a robe dipped in
10050,REV,19,NRSV,blood and his name is called the word of god
10051,REV,19,NRSV,and the armies of heaven wearing fine linen white and pure were following him on white horses
10052,REV,19,NRSV,from his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations and he will rule
10053,REV,19,NRSV,them with a rod of iron he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of god the almighty
10054,REV,19,NRSV,on his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed king of kings and lord of lords
10055,REV,19,NRSV,then i saw an angel standing in the sun and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly in midheaven come gather for the great supper of god
10056,REV,19,NRSV,to eat the flesh of kings the flesh of captains the flesh of the mighty the flesh of horses and their ridersflesh of all both free and slave both small and great
10057,REV,19,NRSV,then i saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against the rider on the horse and against his army
10058,REV,19,NRSV,and the beast was captured and with it the false prophet who had performed in its presence the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur
10059,REV,19,NRSV,and the rest were killed by the sword of the rider on the horse the sword that came from his mouth and all the birds were gorged with their flesh
10060,REV,20,NRSV,then i saw an angel coming down from heaven holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain
