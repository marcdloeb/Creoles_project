intil the gude grun and brairdin brocht forth frute a hunnerfauld thir things sayin he cryt alood he wha has lugs to hear let him hear but his disciples war speirin at him what may this parable be and he said to you it is gien to win the knowledge o the mysteries o gods kingdom but to the lave in parables sae seein they seena and hearin they understaunna noo the parable is this the seed is the word o god and they by the fitroad are they wha hear than comes sautan and cleeks awa the word frae their heart least believin they soud be saved and thir on the rock are they wha whan they hear wi joy welcome the word but they hae nae rute wha believe for a wee and in time o trial fa away and thir that fell amang the thorns are they that hear and as they gang on their way are smoord wi cark and care and the gear and the joys o this life and bring nae frute to the ripenin but that i the gude grun are they wha in an honest and leal heart hear the word and grip it fast and tholin a bring their frute to perfeteness for nane luntin a crusie covers it ower wi a dish or pits it aneath a couch but sets it on a stun that they wha come in may see the licht for thar is nae secret but sal be

hear ye him and whan the voice had been heard jesus was thar his lane and they keepit it to their sels and tellt nae man i thae days whatna things they had seen and it cam aboot that on the neist day as they war come doon frae the mountain a great thrang o folk met him and look a man frae mang the folk cryt oot sayin maister i entreat ye look ye on my son for he is my aebairn and lo a spirit grips him to sudden he skreighs oot and it rives him and dingin him jimply wull leave him and i entreatit thy disciples to cast him oot and they coudna and answerin jesus said o fause and thrawart
