1362,MRK,7,SCO1904,and the pharisees and the scribes speir at him hoo ist thy disciples gangna conform to the tradition o the elders but eat their breid wi unpurifyt hauns
1363,MRK,7,SCO1904,but he said weel did esaiah prophesie o you dissemblers as it is putten doon this nation honor me wi their lips but their heart they haud faurawa frae me
1364,MRK,7,SCO1904,but they offer devotion to me in vain teachin as precepts the commandments o men

1366,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he said to them fu weel ye reject the commaun o god that ye may haud yer ain tradition
1367,MRK,7,SCO1904,for moses said honor yere faither and yere mither and wha sal revile faither and mither by death lat him dee
1368,MRK,7,SCO1904,but ye say gin a man sal say to his faither or his mither whatsoeer ye micht hae frae me is corban that is dedicate to god

1375,MRK,7,SCO1904,and whan he was come intil the hoose frae the thrang his disciples speirt at him anent the parable
1376,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he says to them are even you wantin discernment can ye no see that whatsoeer frae withoot that comes intil the man canna fyle him
1377,MRK,7,SCO1904,for it comesna ben intil his heart but only to his stammack and gaes intil the sewer purifyin a meat
1378,MRK,7,SCO1904,this he said moreover what comes forth oot o the man that fyles the man
1379,MRK,7,SCO1904,for frae within frae ben i the hearts o men ill designs come forth lecherie thefts murders
1380,MRK,7,SCO1904,adulteries covetins knaveries deceit wantonness envy evilspeakin loftiness foolishness
1381,MRK,7,SCO1904,a thir ill things proceed frae within and they fyle the man
1382,MRK,7,SCO1904,and frae thar he raise and gaed intil the borders o tyre and sidon and he entert intil a hoose and wad hae nae man ken but he coudna be keepit private

1386,MRK,7,SCO1904,but she answert and said to him een sae lord yet the wee dowgs aneath the table eat o the mools o the bairns
1387,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he said to her for that word gang yere ways the demon has gane forth oot o yere dochter
1388,MRK,7,SCO1904,and gaun awa to her hoose she faund the bairn lyin on the couch and the demon gane forth
1389,MRK,7,SCO1904,and again gaun forth oot o the pairts o tyre he cam throwe sidon to the loch o galilee up throwe the pairts o the ten cities
1390,MRK,7,SCO1904,and they bring to him ane that can hear nane and speak but a wee and they beg that he wad lay his haun on him
1391,MRK,7,SCO1904,and he led him aside frae the thrang and pat his fingers intil his lugs and touched his tongue wi spittle
1392,MRK,7,SCO1904,and lookin up to heeven he gied a sigh and said ephphatha that is be thou unbarred

1396,MRK,8,SCO1904,in thae days whan again there was a great thrang and they had naething to eat jesus cad his disciples and said to them

1399,MRK,8,SCO1904,and his disciples answert him in whatna gate coud we be able to fill thir men wi bannocks here in a wilderness
1400,MRK,8,SCO1904,and he speirt at them hoo mony bannocks hae ye and they said seeven
1401,MRK,8,SCO1904,and he commandit the thrang to lout doon on the grun and takin the seeven bannocks and giean thanks he brak and gied to his disciples to set afore them and they set afore the thrang
1402,MRK,8,SCO1904,and they had a wheen sma speldrins and he blesst and had them set them on as weel

1410,MRK,8,SCO1904,and he warned them tak tent beware o the barm o the pharisees and the barm o herod
1411,MRK,8,SCO1904,and they war coonsellin amang theirsels we hae brocht nae laives

2108,LUK,6,SCO1904,for a soun tree bringsna forth feckless frute nor dis a feckless tree bring forth gude frute

2110,LUK,6,SCO1904,the gude man oot o the gude gear o his ain heart brings oot what is gude and the ill man oot o the ill what is ill for oot o the owercome o his heart his mou speaks
2111,LUK,6,SCO1904,but for why say ye to me lord lord and divna what i say
2112,LUK,6,SCO1904,whasae comes to me and hears my words i wull schaw ye wham he is like
2113,LUK,6,SCO1904,he is like to a man biggin a hoose wha howkit deep and laid a fundation on a rock and a spate comin the torrent struck sair again that hoose and coudna ding it for it was biggit on a rock
2114,LUK,6,SCO1904,but he wha hears and disna is like to a man that biggit a hoose on the yird wantin a fundation agane whilk cam doon the spate and at ance it was dang in and the fa o that hoose was great
2115,LUK,7,SCO1904,noo eftir he had endit a his teachin i the hearin o the thrang he gaed intil capernaum
2116,LUK,7,SCO1904,and a centurions servinman wha was unco thocht o by him was ill and ready to dee
2117,LUK,7,SCO1904,but hearin aboot jesus he sent to him elders o the jews wha besocht him that he wad come and save his servinman
2118,LUK,7,SCO1904,and whan they cam to jesus they besocht him sair sayin he is wordie to wham ye wad grant this
2119,LUK,7,SCO1904,for he loes oor nation and has biggit us a kirk
2120,LUK,7,SCO1904,and jesus was gaun wi them by this time he no bein far frae the hoose the centurion sent freends to him sayin lord dinna fash yersel for i amna wordie ye soud come under my roof

2123,LUK,7,SCO1904,and whan jesus heard thae words he ferlied at him and turnin to the thrang that followt him said i say tye i haena fund sic leal faith na no in isral
2124,LUK,7,SCO1904,and they that were sent returnin to the hoose faund the servinlad weel
2125,LUK,7,SCO1904,and it cam to pass in order that he was gaun intil a citie cad nain and mony disciples gaed wi him and a great thrang
2126,LUK,7,SCO1904,noo whan he cam to the yett o the citie look thar was carryt oot ane deid the ae son o his mither and she was a weedow and a hantle o folk o the citie war wi her
2127,LUK,7,SCO1904,and whan the lord saw her he had unco pitie on her and says to her dinna greet
2128,LUK,7,SCO1904,and gaun forrit he touched the bier and the bearers stude still and he said laddie i say to thee rise
2129,LUK,7,SCO1904,and he that was deid sat up and begude to speak and he gied him ower to his mither
2130,LUK,7,SCO1904,and a gliff fell on them a and they magnifyt god cryin a great prophet has raise up amang us and god has visitit his folk
2131,LUK,7,SCO1904,and this word aboot him gaed oot intil the hail o judea and a throwe the pairts roond aboot
2132,LUK,7,SCO1904,and the disciples o john tellt him a thir things
2133,LUK,7,SCO1904,and cain to him twa certain anes o his disciples
2134,LUK,7,SCO1904,john sent them to the lord sayin are ye the ane that soud come or are we to look for anither ane
2135,LUK,7,SCO1904,and comin to him the men said john baptist has sent us to thee sayin are ye the ane that soud come or are we to look for anither ane
2136,LUK,7,SCO1904,at that oor he healed mony o their ills and plagues and foul spirits and on mony blin he bestowed sicht
2137,LUK,7,SCO1904,and jesus answerin said to them gang yere ways and cairry word to john what ye saw and heard hoo the blin win their sicht the lameters gang aboot lepers are made clean the deif hear the deid are raised and the needy hae the joyfu message preached to them
2138,LUK,7,SCO1904,and weel may he be wha finds nae cause o stumblin in me
2139,LUK,7,SCO1904,and the messengers o john gaun awa he begude to speak to a the thrang anent john what gaed ye oot intil the waste to see a reed winshaken
2140,LUK,7,SCO1904,but what wast ye gaed oot to see a man clad in saft attire but look they wha are fund in grand attire and fend delicately are in royal palaces
2141,LUK,7,SCO1904,but what gaed ye oot tae see a prophet aye say i tye and muckle mair nor a prophet
2142,LUK,7,SCO1904,this is he o wham it is puttendoon lo i send oot my messenger afore yere face wha sal mak yer fitroad gangable afore ye
2143,LUK,7,SCO1904,for i say tye amang a that are born o weemen there isna a greater prophet than john the baptist yet he wha is the less in gods kingdom is greater nor he
2144,LUK,7,SCO1904,and a the folk whan they heard and the taxmen laudit god bein bapteezt in johns bapteezin
2145,LUK,7,SCO1904,but the pharisees and the writers pat aside the coonsel o god again their sels no bein bapteezt o him
2146,LUK,7,SCO1904,unto what than sal i compare the men o this generation and until what are they like
2147,LUK,7,SCO1904,they are like bairns sittin i the merkitplace and cryin ane to anither and sayin we piped to ye and ye dancedna we crooned a dirge to ye and ye gratna
2148,LUK,7,SCO1904,for john the baptist is come naither eatin breid nor drinkin wine and ye say he has a demon
2149,LUK,7,SCO1904,the son o man is come eatin and drinkin and ye say see a man o gluttony and a winetippler a freend o taxmen and the illdeedie
2150,LUK,7,SCO1904,and yet wisdom is justifeet o her bairns
2151,LUK,7,SCO1904,and a certain ane o the pharisees wad hae him come and eat wi him and gaun intil the hoose o the pharisee he sat doon to meat
2152,LUK,7,SCO1904,and see a wumman o the citie wha was an illdooer whan she kent that he was sittin at meat i the pharisees hoose she gat her an alabaster cruse o perfume
2153,LUK,7,SCO1904,and staunin ahint him at his feet she begude to weet his feet wi her tears and wiped the tears aff wi her hair and was kissin his feet and crystit them wi the perfume
2154,LUK,7,SCO1904,but the pharisee wha had bidden him seein it spak till his sel this ane gin he war a prophet wad hae taen tent wha and o whatna sort this wumman is that touches him that she is a bad ane
2155,LUK,7,SCO1904,and jesus answerin says to him simon i hae a thing to say tye and he says maister say on
2156,LUK,7,SCO1904,thar was a certain creditor wha had twa debtors the ane was awn fyvehunner sillerpennies and the tither fifty
2157,LUK,7,SCO1904,and whan they had nocht to pay wi he forgae them baith whilk o them noo wull loe him maist
2158,LUK,7,SCO1904,answerin quo simon i wad think he to wham he forgae the maist and he says to them ye hae judged richt
2159,LUK,7,SCO1904,and turnin him to the wumman he says to simon see ye this wumman i cam intil yere hoose ye gied me nae watir for my feet but she wat my feet wi her tears and wiped them aff wi her hair
2160,LUK,7,SCO1904,nae kiss giedyeme but she sin i cam in hasna left aff to kiss my feet
2161,LUK,7,SCO1904,wi nae ulyie did ye anoint my heid but she wi perfume crystit my feet
2162,LUK,7,SCO1904,sae say i tye her mony sins hae been forgien for she loed muckle but to wham little is forgien he loes little
2163,LUK,7,SCO1904,and he said till her yere sins are forgien
2164,LUK,7,SCO1904,and they sittin at meat wi him begude to say to their sels wha is this that is een forgien sins
2165,LUK,7,SCO1904,but he said to the wumman yere faith has saved ye gang in peace
2166,LUK,8,SCO1904,and it cam aboot that in due coorse he gaed throwe a cities and villages preachin and bringin the gudetidins o the kingdom o god and the twal war wi him
2167,LUK,8,SCO1904,and certain weemen wha had been healed o foul spirits and illnesses mary cad the magdalene
2168,LUK,8,SCO1904,and joan wife o chuza herods steward and susanna and mony mair wha war giean oot to them o their ain plenishin
2169,LUK,8,SCO1904,and whan a great thrang cam thegither and they o the cities journeyd till him he spak throwe a parable
2170,LUK,8,SCO1904,a sawer gaed oot to saw his seed and as he sawed some fell aside the fitroad and was trampit doon and the burdies o the air devoort it
2171,LUK,8,SCO1904,and ither fell on the rock and as sune as it brairdit it dwined awa for it wanted moisture
2172,LUK,8,SCO1904,and ither fell amang the thorns and growin up wit the thorns smoord it
2173,LUK,8,SCO1904,and ither some fell intil the gude grun and brairdin brocht forth frute a hunnerfauld thir things sayin he cryt alood he wha has lugs to hear let him hear
2174,LUK,8,SCO1904,but his disciples war speirin at him what may this parable be
2175,LUK,8,SCO1904,and he said to you it is gien to win the knowledge o the mysteries o gods kingdom but to the lave in parables sae seein they seena and hearin they understaunna
2176,LUK,8,SCO1904,noo the parable is this the seed is the word o god
2177,LUK,8,SCO1904,and they by the fitroad are they wha hear than comes sautan and cleeks awa the word frae their heart least believin they soud be saved
2178,LUK,8,SCO1904,and thir on the rock are they wha whan they hear wi joy welcome the word but they hae nae rute wha believe for a wee and in time o trial fa away

3061,JHN,2,SCO1904,than upspak the jews to him what ferlies hae ye to schaw us gin ye put oot yere haun to siclike wark
3062,JHN,2,SCO1904,jesus said till them mak an end o this temple and in thrie days ill restore it
3063,JHN,2,SCO1904,than cryt the jews sax and forty year gaed by afore this temple was a biggit and are ye gaun to bigg it in thrie days
3064,JHN,2,SCO1904,but it was the holie temple o his ain body he spak o
3065,JHN,2,SCO1904,and sae belyve when he was risen frae the deid the disciples cad to mind that he had said this to them and they lippened the word and a that jesus said
3066,JHN,2,SCO1904,and whan he was at the pasche in jerusalem as the feast gaed on mony begude to believe on his name whan they saw the ferlies dune aneath his haun
3067,JHN,2,SCO1904,but jesus didna lippen and gie his sel ower to them for he kent men
3068,JHN,2,SCO1904,and needitna that ony soud tell him aboot a man for he kent a that was in man
3069,JHN,3,SCO1904,thar was ane o the pharisees by name nicodemus and in authoritie amang the jews
3070,JHN,3,SCO1904,and he cam i the mirk o the nicht to jesus and quo he maister we a ken ye are a teacher frae god for nane could do sic wunnerworks as ye do gin god warna wi him
3071,JHN,3,SCO1904,jesus said to him truly say i tye gin a man bena born again his een sal never see gods kingdom
3072,JHN,3,SCO1904,quo nicodemus but hoos a man to be born in eild maun he return till his mithers womb and be born ower again
3073,JHN,3,SCO1904,but jesus spak truly truly say i tye gin a man bena watirborn and spiritborn hese no come intil gods kingdom
3074,JHN,3,SCO1904,and aye that whilk is born o the flesh is itsel flesh and that whilk is born o the spirit is spirit
3075,JHN,3,SCO1904,mak nae ferlie o my words ye maun be born again
3076,JHN,3,SCO1904,the wind blaws whaur it wull and ye hear the sough ot but canna ken whaur it comes frae nor whaur it gangs tae sae is it wi ane born o the spirit
3077,JHN,3,SCO1904,nicodemus says to him hoo can siccan a thing be
3078,JHN,3,SCO1904,quo jesus to him can ye be a maister o isral and kenna thir things
3079,JHN,3,SCO1904,truly truly say i tye
3080,JHN,3,SCO1904,we speak what we ken and bear witness o oor ain een and ye winna hear us
3081,JHN,3,SCO1904,gin i hae tauld ye things o the yirth and ye winna hae them wull ye lippen my word anent things o heeven
3082,JHN,3,SCO1904,and nae man has eer gane up aboon but he that cam doon frae aboon the son o man wha bides aboon
3083,JHN,3,SCO1904,and like as moses i the wilderness heized up the serpent sae maun the son o man be liftit heigh
3084,JHN,3,SCO1904,that a wha lippen till him soudna dee but hae life for aye
3085,JHN,3,SCO1904,for god sae loved the warld as to gie his son the onlybegotten ane that ilka ane wha lippens till him sudna dee but hae life for aye
3086,JHN,3,SCO1904,for god sentna his son intil the warld to bring condemnation ont but that raither the warld micht be saved by him
3087,JHN,3,SCO1904,and ane that lippens him isna hauden guilty but ane wha winna lippen him is judged guilty een no for he hasna lippened to the son o god the onlybegotten ane
3088,JHN,3,SCO1904,and here is the sentence he drees that licht beams on the warld and men loe the mirk and no the licht for that their deeds are wrang
3089,JHN,3,SCO1904,for ilka ane that follows ill hates the licht and comes na tillt jalousin that his ill deeds wull be seen
3090,JHN,3,SCO1904,but the man wha has the truth seeks the licht that a his deeds may be plainly seen that they are dune i the pooer o god
3091,JHN,3,SCO1904,eftir thae things jesus and the disciples cam intil judea and he bade wi them bapteezin
3092,JHN,3,SCO1904,and john his sel was in enon narby salim bapteezin for thar was rowth o watir tharaboot and the folk cam to be bapteezt
3093,JHN,3,SCO1904,for john wasna yet cuisten intil prison
3094,JHN,3,SCO1904,and noo thar cam a quaisten atween johns disciples and a jew anent purification
3095,JHN,3,SCO1904,and till john they cam sayin maister the ane that was ayont jordan wi ye the ane ye bure witness till dye ken hes bapteezin and a the folk come till him
3096,JHN,3,SCO1904,john says to them ane can hae naething gien him gin it be na frae heeven
3097,JHN,3,SCO1904,ye mind yersels that i said i am no the messiah but ane sent afore him
3098,JHN,3,SCO1904,the ane that has the bride he is the bridegroom but the bridegrooms gude freend staunin by and hearin his word joys i the voice o the bridegroom this is my joy fulfilled
3099,JHN,3,SCO1904,he maun wax but i maun wane
3100,JHN,3,SCO1904,he that comes frae aboon is aboon a folk he wha is o the yirth is yirthlike and speaks o the yirth but he wha is frae aboon is aboon a
3101,JHN,3,SCO1904,and he speaks o the sicht o his ain een and thar isna a man to tak him at his word
3102,JHN,3,SCO1904,but ony ane that taks his word he has set his seal to the truth o god and made it his ain
3103,JHN,3,SCO1904,for the ane sent frae god speaks gods word for he has sent the spirit ayont a measure
3104,JHN,3,SCO1904,the faither loes his son and gies a things intil his hauns
3105,JHN,3,SCO1904,the man wha lippens on the son has life for aye and he wha winna believe the son sal see life nevir but the ban o god on him sal bide
3106,JHN,4,SCO1904,noo whan the lord kent the pharisees had word that he gaithert in and bapteezt mair folk than john did
3107,JHN,4,SCO1904,but it was the disciples and no jesus sel wha bapteezt
3108,JHN,4,SCO1904,he quat the jews kintraside and gaed awa again intil galilee
3109,JHN,4,SCO1904,and he behoved to gang athort samaria
3110,JHN,4,SCO1904,and he lichtit on a samaria citie cad sychar narhaun the bit grun jaucob gied to joseph
3111,JHN,4,SCO1904,and jaucobs waal
3112,JHN,4,SCO1904,was tharat and jesus forfouchten wi the way cuist his sel doon on the waal and it was aboot the dennertime
3113,JHN,4,SCO1904,than thar cam a samariawumman forrit to draw watir quo jesus lat me have a sowp o watir
3114,JHN,4,SCO1904,his disciples had a gane to the citie for meat
3115,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo the samariawumman hoo ist that ye bein a jew are seekin drink frae me a samariawumman for the jews hae nae trokin nor neeborliness wi the samariafolk
3116,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo jesus gin ye kent gods gift and wha it soud be that said gie me a sowp o watir ye wad hae socht frae him the leevin watir and gottent too
3117,JHN,4,SCO1904,said the wumman to him sir ye hae naething to lat doon the waal and the waals unco deep whaur fin ye the leevin watir
3118,JHN,4,SCO1904,ye canna be greater nor oor forebear jaucob wha gied us the waal and slockened his ain drouth wit and the drouth o his bairns and his beasts
3119,JHN,4,SCO1904,jesus said to her wha may drink this watir wull be drouthie syne
3120,JHN,4,SCO1904,but wha drinks o the watir i gie him sal be drouthie nevirmair for the watir i gie him sal be in him an unseen waal springin up intil life eternal
3121,JHN,4,SCO1904,the wumman cryt oot sir lat me hae this watir no to be drouthie and neer to fash to come to the waal again
3122,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo jesus gang awa and ca yere gudeman and come again belyve
3123,JHN,4,SCO1904,but the wumman said to him i haena a gudeman quo jesus ye hae dune richt to say ye haena a gudeman
3124,JHN,4,SCO1904,for ye hae had fyve and the ane ye hae enoo is no yere ain gudeman ye spak truth thar
3125,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo the wumman sir i jalouse ye maun be a prophet
3126,JHN,4,SCO1904,oor forebears worshipped i this vera mountain but yere folk say jerusalems the place whaur folk soud worship
3127,JHN,4,SCO1904,jesus pat in wumman lippen to me the oors at haun whan naither

3130,JHN,4,SCO1904,thar
3131,JHN,4,SCO1904,sal they worship the faither
3132,JHN,4,SCO1904,ye kenna what ye ser but we ken what we worship and salvation comes frae amang the jews
3133,JHN,4,SCO1904,but the oor is at haun and een noo it comes whan gods ain worshippers sal worship the faither in the truth and wi the spirit for the faither wad hae siclike to seek him
3134,JHN,4,SCO1904,god is a spirit and wha worship him maun een do sae i the spirit and wi the truth
3135,JHN,4,SCO1904,the wumman says i ken messiahs comin that folk ca the christ whan he comes hell tell us a
3136,JHN,4,SCO1904,jesus spak i thats noo speakin tye am
3137,JHN,4,SCO1904,the christ
3138,JHN,4,SCO1904,on the back o this cam the disciples and ferlied that he soud be speakin wi the wumman but nane o them speirt what are ye seekin nor hoo ist that ye talk wi the wumman
3139,JHN,4,SCO1904,than the wumman leavin her watirstoup gaed awa to the citie and cryt oot to the men
3140,JHN,4,SCO1904,co way and see a man that tellt me a that evir i did is he no the messiah
3141,JHN,4,SCO1904,then they gaed oot o the citie to come till him
3142,JHN,4,SCO1904,but atween times his disciples war askaskin him maister wull ye no eat
3143,JHN,4,SCO1904,but quo he to them i hae meat that ye kenna
3144,JHN,4,SCO1904,and sae they speirt ane o anither think ye ony ane brocht him ocht to eat
3145,JHN,4,SCO1904,quo jesus its meat to me to do his wull that sent me and finish his wark
3146,JHN,4,SCO1904,div ye no say fowr months and than the hairst but unsteek yere een and see the fields theyre whitenin till the hairst een noo

3149,JHN,4,SCO1904,i bade ye to a hairst whauron ye hadna toiled ither men toiled and ye are entered on their reward
3150,JHN,4,SCO1904,and mony o the samariafolk lippened on him for the wummans sake wha aye threepit he tellt me a that evir i did
3151,JHN,4,SCO1904,sae whan they cam till him they besocht him to bide wi them and he stoppit twathrie days thar
3152,JHN,4,SCO1904,and a hantle mair believed whan they heard his ain word
3153,JHN,4,SCO1904,and quo they to the wumman noo we believe no for yere report for oor ain lugs hae heard him and noo we ken that he is the anointit ane the warlds saviour
3154,JHN,4,SCO1904,and twa days eftir he gaed forth again intil some o the pairts o galilee
3155,JHN,4,SCO1904,for jesus his sel testifyt that a prophet had nae repute in his ain kintraside
3156,JHN,4,SCO1904,syne he cam intil the pairts o galilee and the folk thar acceptit him for they had seen a that he did at the feast in jerusalem for they as weel gaed up till the feast
3157,JHN,4,SCO1904,and ance mair he cam up till galileecana whaur he made the watir wine and there was a certain hie officer whase son was ill at capernaum

3165,JHN,4,SCO1904,this is the second wunerwark jesus did bein come oot o judea intil galilee
3166,JHN,5,SCO1904,eftir thir things thar cam a feast o the jews and jesus gaed up till jerusalem
3167,JHN,5,SCO1904,noo in jerusalem by the sheepport is a pool cad i the hebrew bethesda and beside it fyve porticoes

3192,JHN,5,SCO1904,for een as the faither has life within his sel sae has he giftit to the son to hae life within his sel
3193,JHN,5,SCO1904,and has gien to him pooer to gie judgment as weel for that he is the son o man

4984,ROM,2,SCO1904,to thae on the ither haun wha contend and followna the truth but follow ill anger and wrath
4985,ROM,2,SCO1904,dool and pain on ilka mans saul wha works oot ocht that is ill baith to the jew first and eke to the greek
4986,ROM,2,SCO1904,but glorie and honor and peace to ilka ane wha dis that whilk is gude baith to the jews first and eke to the greek
4987,ROM,2,SCO1904,for thar is nae walinoot o faces wi god
4988,ROM,2,SCO1904,for as mony as hae sinned wantin the law sal eke perish wantin the law and as mony as hae sinned aneath the law sal be condemned aneath the law
4989,ROM,2,SCO1904,for it isna thae that hear the law that staun richt wi god but thae wha do the law sal be appruvd
4990,ROM,2,SCO1904,for whan fremd folk thae wha hae nae law do by natur the warks o the law thir wantin the law are to thirsels a law
4991,ROM,2,SCO1904,wha in vera deed gie prufe o the laws wark whilk is graven on their hearts their conscience giean testimonie in their thochts by excusin or else wytin them
4992,ROM,2,SCO1904,in the day whan god sal judge a the secrets o men throwe jesus christ een accordin to my joyfumessage
4993,ROM,2,SCO1904,but if ye cain yersel a jew staun on law and boast in god
4994,ROM,2,SCO1904,and ken his wull and appruve the best things and hae yere lear i the law
4995,ROM,2,SCO1904,and are perswadit that ye are yersel a leader o blin anes a licht to a i the mirk
4996,ROM,2,SCO1904,a guide for ignorant anes a teacher o bairns haein the shapin o lear and truth in the law
4997,ROM,2,SCO1904,ye than that tell anither why daeyena tell yersel ye that are sayin ane soudna steal dae ye steal

4999,ROM,2,SCO1904,ye that hae yere boast i the law dae ye brek the law and dishonor god
5000,ROM,2,SCO1904,for the name o god on yere accoont is dishonored amang the nations een as it has been puttendoon
5001,ROM,2,SCO1904,for on the aehaun circumceesion is a gain gin ye are keepin the law but on the ither haun gin ye be a breker o the law than yere circumceesion has come to be uncircumceesion
5002,ROM,2,SCO1904,gin aiblins then the uncircumceesed keep the holie biddens o the law winna the uncircumceesion be coontit as circumceesion
5003,ROM,2,SCO1904,and the uncircumceesion o natur gin it cairries oot the law sal condemn you wha wi the letter and circumceesion brek throwe the law
5004,ROM,2,SCO1904,for he isna the jew wha is but
5005,ROM,2,SCO1904,ane ootwardly nor is circumceesion whilk is seen i the flesh the circumceesion
5006,ROM,2,SCO1904,but he is the jew wha is ane within and true circumceesion is the circumceesion o the heart in spirit no in name whase acceptance isna o men but o god
5007,ROM,3,SCO1904,what way than is the jew heigher or what gets he oot o his circumceesion
5008,ROM,3,SCO1904,muckle a ways first this that they war gien the word o god
5009,ROM,3,SCO1904,for what gin some o them had doots sal their doots mak in vain lippenin to god
5010,ROM,3,SCO1904,never but lat god be true and ilka man a leear een as it is putten doon to the end thy words soud be uphauden and thou soud prevail whan thou contends
5011,ROM,3,SCO1904,but gin oor wrang maks gods truth shine what sal we say is god wrang wha punishes i am speakin as a man
5012,ROM,3,SCO1904,far frae it or hoo soud god judge the warld
5013,ROM,3,SCO1904,but gin gods truth appeared greater to his glorie by reason o my leean am i ony mair as a sinner to be condemned
5014,ROM,3,SCO1904,and why no juist as some slander us and report us as sayin lat us do ill that gude may come whase condemnation is richt
5015,ROM,3,SCO1904,weel what than are we beildin oorsels no the least for we hae already chairged baith jews and greeks o bein aneath sin
5016,ROM,3,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon thar is nane holie na no ane
5017,ROM,3,SCO1904,thar is nane wyss thar is nane seekin oot god
5018,ROM,3,SCO1904,they are a gane agley they are athegither feckless thar is nane schawin love no sae muckle as ane
5019,ROM,3,SCO1904,their hauss is like an open sheugh wi their tongues they hae used doobleness the venom o the asp is aneath their lips
5020,ROM,3,SCO1904,whase mou is fu o bannin and bitternesss
5021,ROM,3,SCO1904,glegg are their feet to spill blude
5022,ROM,3,SCO1904,destroyin and sorrowin are i their waygaun
5023,ROM,3,SCO1904,and a waygaun o peace hae they nevir kent
5024,ROM,3,SCO1904,nae fear o god is afore their een
5025,ROM,3,SCO1904,noo we ken that whatsoeer the law says it says it to thae that are aneath the law sae that ilka mou may be stoppit and the hail warld may come aneath the judgments o god
5026,ROM,3,SCO1904,inasmuckle as by warks o law sal nae flesh be made richtous in his sicht for throwe the law is the unveilin o sin
5027,ROM,3,SCO1904,but noo athegither sindry frae the law a richtousness o god has been set forth bein uphauden by the law and the prophets
5028,ROM,3,SCO1904,een a richtousness o god throwe faith in jesus christ comin to a wha hae faith for a are ane
5029,ROM,3,SCO1904,for a hae sinned and a fail o the glorie o god
5030,ROM,3,SCO1904,bein held richtous freely throwe his ain favor by the redeemin o christ jesus
5031,ROM,3,SCO1904,wham god sut forth as oor coverinower by faith in his blude for the settin forth o his richtousness to the passinby o oor auld sins
5032,ROM,3,SCO1904,to schaw the gudeness o god in his tholin at this time to the end he micht be richtous his sel while declarin richtous the man wha believes in jesus
5033,ROM,3,SCO1904,whaur comes in gloryin than it is putten awa on whatna principle o warks nay but throwe the principle o faith
5034,ROM,3,SCO1904,we are reckonin than that a man is held richtous by faith sindry frae the warks o the law
5035,ROM,3,SCO1904,or is god the god o jews only no o the nations as weel aye eke o the nations
5036,ROM,3,SCO1904,gin at least he be the god wha wull justify the circumceesion for their faith and the uncircumceesion by like faith
5037,ROM,3,SCO1904,are we than makin the law naething no sae on the contrar we are makin siccar the law
5038,ROM,4,SCO1904,whatna than sal we say that abram oor faither i the flesh has gotten
5039,ROM,4,SCO1904,for gin abram by his warks was acceptit as richtous he had fundation for gloryin yet no afore god
5040,ROM,4,SCO1904,for what is putten doon i the buik abram lippened god and it was set doon as richtousness
5041,ROM,4,SCO1904,but to him wha works the reward isna coontit by way o favor but by way o debt
5042,ROM,4,SCO1904,while to him wha worksna but lippens him wha justifies the ungodly the faith o him is coontit as richtousness
5043,ROM,4,SCO1904,een as dauvid schaws the weelbein o the man to wham god coonts richtousness sindry frae warks
5044,ROM,4,SCO1904,happy they whase illdeedinesses are forgien and whase sins are happit ower
5045,ROM,4,SCO1904,happy is the man whase sin the lord disna haud again him
5046,ROM,4,SCO1904,comes than this blessin on the circumceesion or on the uncircumceesion as weel for we are sayin that faith was coontit to abram as richtousness
5047,ROM,4,SCO1904,hoo than was it coontit whan in circumceesion or in uncircumceesion no in circumceesion but in uncircumceesion
5048,ROM,4,SCO1904,and he was gien the sign o circumceesion a seal o the faithrichtousness he had in his
5049,ROM,4,SCO1904,uncircumceesion sae that he micht be the great heid o a wha hae faith while in their uncircumceesion that richtousness soud be coontit to them
5050,ROM,4,SCO1904,and the great heid o circumceesion to them wha not only hae circumceesion but wha follow the steps o oor faither abram in his uncircumceesion
5051,ROM,4,SCO1904,for it wasna throwe the law that the promise was gien to abram or to his seed anent bein the heir o the warld but throwe the richtousness o faith
5052,ROM,4,SCO1904,for gin they wha are o law war heirs faith has failed and the promise has come to nocht
5053,ROM,4,SCO1904,for the law schaws wrath but whaur thar is nae law thar is nae brekin ot
5054,ROM,4,SCO1904,sae it is o faith that it may be by favor in order that the promise may be siccar till a the seed no to that o the law only but eke to that o the abramfaith wha is the great heid o us a
5055,ROM,4,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon the great heid o mony nations hae i made thee afore god wham he believed een him wha raises the deid and cas things that arena een as gin they war
5056,ROM,4,SCO1904,wha whan hope was gane on hope held fast that he micht become faither o mony nations een as it was spoken sae sal be thy seed
5057,ROM,4,SCO1904,and mainteenin strang his faith he lookitna on his ain body as bein deid bein een aboot a hunneryearauld nor sarahs womb as deid
5058,ROM,4,SCO1904,but lookin on the promise o god he becam strang in faith and swithertna wi unbelief giean glorie to god
5059,ROM,4,SCO1904,and siccar i the belief that what he had promised he was strang to perform
5060,ROM,4,SCO1904,and sae it was coontit to him for richtousness
5061,ROM,4,SCO1904,but it wasna for him alane that this was sae coontit to him
5062,ROM,4,SCO1904,but eke for oor sakes to wham it was to be coontit to us wha pit oor faith in him wha raised jesus oor lord frae the deid
5063,ROM,4,SCO1904,wha was delivert up for oor sins and was raised again for oor justifyin
5064,ROM,5,SCO1904,bein than coontit richtous by faith lat us hae peace in god by oor lord jesus christ
5065,ROM,5,SCO1904,by wham is the introducin we hae had by oor faith intil this favor in whilk we staun and lat us rejoice i the hope o gods glorie
5066,ROM,5,SCO1904,and no this alane but een rejoice in oor troubles kennin that troubles work oot langtholin
5067,ROM,5,SCO1904,and langtholin testin and testin hope
5068,ROM,5,SCO1904,and hope maksna ashamed for that gods love has been shed abreid in oor hearts throwe the holie spirit gien to us
5069,ROM,5,SCO1904,for we yet bein feckless christ in due season deet for the ungodlie
5070,ROM,5,SCO1904,far jimply wad ony ane dee for an upricht man yet aiblins for a holie man ane micht een daur death
5071,ROM,5,SCO1904,but god commends his ain love to us in that een while we war yet in sin christ deet for us
5072,ROM,5,SCO1904,muckle mair than bein noo coontit richtous throwe his blude we sal be savt frae the wrath throwe him
5073,ROM,5,SCO1904,for gif bein faes we war reconcilt to god throwe his sons death hoo muckle mair bein noo reconcilt sal we be savt in his life
5074,ROM,5,SCO1904,and no only sae but rejoicin in god throwe oor lord jesus christ throwe wham at this present we receive the reconciliation
5075,ROM,5,SCO1904,for this reason juist as sin cam intil the warld throwe ae man and throwe sin death and sae to a men death cam for a sinned
5076,ROM,5,SCO1904,for to the law sin was i the warld but sin isna coontit up gin thar war nae law
5077,ROM,5,SCO1904,but death had pooer frae adam doon to moses een ower thae wha hadna sinned
5078,ROM,5,SCO1904,like to the sin o adam wha is a likeness o the comin ane
5079,ROM,5,SCO1904,but no as the faut was the gift o the favor for gin by the faut o ane mony deet mair was the favor o god and the free gift the favor o the ae man jesus christ was mair sufficin for the mony
5080,ROM,5,SCO1904,and no as throwe ane that sinned is the free gift for the judgment was to condemnation on accoont o ae faut whauras the lovinfavor is by mony fauts to justification
5081,ROM,5,SCO1904,for gin throwe the faut o ane death had pooer throwe that ane muckle mair they wha receive the unco plenitude o the favor and hae gien to them the free gift o richtousness sal hae pooer in life throwe ane jesus christ
5082,ROM,5,SCO1904,and sae as throwe the ae faut condemnation cam on a men sae throwe ae richtousness establisht the free gift comes to a men
5083,ROM,5,SCO1904,for een as throwe the disobedience o ae man the mony war coontit as sinners sae throwe the obedience o ane sal the mony be coontit richtous
5084,ROM,5,SCO1904,but law cam in that the offence micht be seen to exceed but whaur offences exceedit the tenderlove muckle mair exceedit
5085,ROM,5,SCO1904,that een as sin had pooer in death sae tenderlove soud hae pooer throwe richtousness to eternal life throwe jesus christ our lord
5086,ROM,6,SCO1904,what than are we to say are we to gang on in sin that mair tenderlove may be seen
5087,ROM,6,SCO1904,awa wi it hoo sal we wha deet to sin be leevin ony langr int
5088,ROM,6,SCO1904,kenyena that a we wha war bapteezt intil jesus christ war bapteezt intil his death
5089,ROM,6,SCO1904,we wi him war buryt than in oor bapteezin intil his death sae that een as christ was raised up frae mang the deid by the glorious pooer o the faither sae we in the new life micht walk
5090,ROM,6,SCO1904,for gin we hae been ane wi him i the image o his death nae doot sae sal we be i the image o his risinagain
5091,ROM,6,SCO1904,tak tent o this that oor auld man was wi him crucifyt sae that the body o sin micht perish that we soud ser sin nae mair
5092,ROM,6,SCO1904,for he that has deet is quat o sin
5093,ROM,6,SCO1904,noo gin we deet wi christ we threep that we sal een leeve wi him
5094,ROM,6,SCO1904,kennin that christ bein raised up frae the deid dees nae mair death has nae pooer ower him
5095,ROM,6,SCO1904,for the death that he deet he deet to sin
5096,ROM,6,SCO1904,ance for a but noo that he leeves he leeves to god
5097,ROM,6,SCO1904,and sae you yersels coont yersels as deid to sin but leevin to god in christ jesus
5098,ROM,6,SCO1904,dinna lat sin than hae pooer i yere deein body to gar ye mind its craikin
5099,ROM,6,SCO1904,nor gie ower yere pooers as instruments o wickedness to sin but gie ower yersels to god as gin leevin frae amang the deid and yere pooers as instruments o holiness to god
5100,ROM,6,SCO1904,for sin sal nae mair hae pooer ower ye for ye arena aneath the law but aneath freefavor
5101,ROM,6,SCO1904,and what than are we to sin for that we arena aneath the law but aneath freefavor far frae that
5102,ROM,6,SCO1904,div ye no ken that to the ane ye are giean yersels ower to obey as servants servants dae ye become to wham ye gie obedience whether aiblins it be o sin to death or obedience to holiness
5103,ROM,6,SCO1904,but thanks to god that haein been sins servants ye gied obedience oot o the heart to yon form o lear intil whilk ye war shapit
5104,ROM,6,SCO1904,and bein set free frae sin ye war made into servants to holiness
5105,ROM,6,SCO1904,i speak but as a man for the wauffness o yer flesh for een as ye gied ower yere pooers as servants to vileness and lawlessness for lawlessness sae noo gie ower yere pooers as servants to holiness for yere perfection
5106,ROM,6,SCO1904,for whan ye war sins servants ye had naither airt nor pairt in holiness
5107,ROM,6,SCO1904,what frute had ye than i yon things ye are noo ashamed o for the end o sic is death
5108,ROM,6,SCO1904,but noo bein set free frae sin and made servants to god ye hae frute to sanctification and at the langlast eternal life
5109,ROM,6,SCO1904,for the fee o sin is death but gods gree is eternal life in jesus christ oor lord
5110,ROM,7,SCO1904,kenyena brethren for to sic as are leal to the law am i speakin that the law has pooer ower a man for siccan a time as the lenth o his life
5111,ROM,7,SCO1904,for the wumman mairryt to a husband is bund by law as lang as he leeves but gin aiblins the husband dee she has fu libertie frae the rule o her husband
5112,ROM,7,SCO1904,and sae her husband leevin gin she become anither mans she wad be cad adulteress but gin aiblins the husband dee she is free frae the rule sae as to be nae adulteress een tho she become anither mans
5113,ROM,7,SCO1904,sae than my brethren ye too war brocht to death throwe the body o christ to the end ye micht become anithers his wha was raised frae the deid that we soud bring forth frute to god
5114,ROM,7,SCO1904,for whan we war in the flesh thae passions o sin excited by the law wrocht in oor pooers to bring forth frute to death
5115,ROM,7,SCO1904,but noo we are dischairged frae the law bein deid as to that by whilk we war hauden siccar sae that we micht gie service in a new spirit and no in the auld formality
5116,ROM,7,SCO1904,what than are we to say that the law is sinfu far frae it on the contrar i had neer taen tent o sin gin it warna by the law for i hadna ony thocht o covetin gin the law hadna said ye sanna covet
5117,ROM,7,SCO1904,but sin makin an occasion wrocht in me throwe the commandment a mainner o covetousness for sindry frae the law sin was deid
5118,ROM,7,SCO1904,i mysel was leevin ance sindry frae the law but the commandment cam and sin lap to life and i deet
5119,ROM,7,SCO1904,and the commaun that whilk was to be for life i faund to be for me death
5120,ROM,7,SCO1904,for sin makin occasion o the commaun clean deceivt me and by it slew me
5121,ROM,7,SCO1904,sae that on the ae haun the law is perfete and the commandment holie and just and gude
5122,ROM,7,SCO1904,weel than did the gude become death to me far frae it on the ither haun it was sin that it soud kythe as sin throwe that whilk was gude workin oot death in me that by the commandment sin soud be seen to be unco sinfu
5123,ROM,7,SCO1904,for we ken that the law is spiritual but i am but a creatur o flesh sellt as to a maister sin
5124,ROM,7,SCO1904,for that whilk i am workin oot i appruvena for what i wissna that i pursue but what i hate that dae i
5125,ROM,7,SCO1904,gin than i dae what i wadna i own that the law is richt
5126,ROM,7,SCO1904,and noo it isna i wha am workin it oot but it is the sin that dwalls in me
5127,ROM,7,SCO1904,for i ken thar dwallsna in me that is in my flesh ae gude thing for the desirin lies nar to me but the workinoot o gude disna
5128,ROM,7,SCO1904,for it isna the gude i wiss for i dae but raither the ill i wadna do i practeese
5129,ROM,7,SCO1904,but gin i dae that whilk i wadna it is nae mair i wha am workin it oot but the sin dwallin in me
5130,ROM,7,SCO1904,and sae i fin thar is a principle
5131,ROM,7,SCO1904,that whan i wad dae gude the ill lies nar me
5132,ROM,7,SCO1904,for in my benmaist heart i joy in the law o god
5133,ROM,7,SCO1904,but i see anither principle in my bodily pooers fechtin again the principle o my mind and takin me prisoner by the principle o sin that is in my bodily pooers
5134,ROM,7,SCO1904,a waesome man am i wha sal rescue me oot o the body o this death
5135,ROM,7,SCO1904,noo god be thankit and sae i mysel wi my mind am in service to the law o god while wi the flesh i ser the principle o sin
5136,ROM,8,SCO1904,sae than thar is nae condemnation for thae that are in christ jesus
5137,ROM,8,SCO1904,for the principle o the spirit o life in christ jesus delivert me frae the principle o sin and death
5138,ROM,8,SCO1904,for what coudna be by the law in that it was feckless throwe oor flesh god condemned sin i the flesh in sendin his ain son i the image o oor flesh and because o sin
5139,ROM,8,SCO1904,that the holy ends o the law micht be seen in us wha walk conform to the spirit and no conform to the flesh
5140,ROM,8,SCO1904,for they wha leeve conform to the flesh wad raither hae the things o the flesh but they followin the spirit wad hae the things o the spirit
5141,ROM,8,SCO1904,sae what the flesh prefers is but death but what the spirit prefers is indeed life and peace
5142,ROM,8,SCO1904,for what the flesh prefers is at enmity wi god seein it disna gie itsel ower to gods law nor in fact can it sae dae
5143,ROM,8,SCO1904,and they wha hae their bein i the flesh canna pleasur god
5144,ROM,8,SCO1904,but ye haena yere bein i the flesh but i the spirit gin gods spirit is bidin in ye but gin ony ane hasna christs spirit he isna o his
5145,ROM,8,SCO1904,but gin christ is in ye the body is deid on accoont o sin but the spirit is leevin on accoont o holiness
5146,ROM,8,SCO1904,and gin the spirit wha raised up jesus frae amang the deid dwalls in ye he that raised up christ jesus frae amang the deid sal een gie life to yere deein bodies on accoont o his indwallin spirit in ye
5147,ROM,8,SCO1904,sae than brethren debtors are we no to the flesh conform to the flesh to leeve
5148,ROM,8,SCO1904,for gin conform to the flesh ye are leevin ye are sure to be deein but gin i the spirit ye are slayin the deeds o the body ye sal leeve
5149,ROM,8,SCO1904,for as mony as are
5150,ROM,8,SCO1904,airtit by gods spirit they are gods bairns
5151,ROM,8,SCO1904,for ye hadna putten in ye a spirit o slavery bringin ye back intil dreid but ye had putten intil ye a spirit o adoption in whilk we cryt oot abba faither
5152,ROM,8,SCO1904,the spirit himsel is joint witness wi oor spirit that we are bairns o god
5153,ROM,8,SCO1904,but gin bairns than heirs as weel gods heirs and jointheirs wi christ gin at least we jointly suffer that we may be jointly glorifyt
5154,ROM,8,SCO1904,for i coont that what we dree i this present is no wordie to be mentioned alang wi the glorie to come whilk is to be made kent throwe us
5155,ROM,8,SCO1904,for the fainlookitforrit o the creation is waitin for the revealin o gods bairns
5156,ROM,8,SCO1904,for to vanity was creation made subject no o its ain wull but by him wha made it subject
5157,ROM,8,SCO1904,in hope that the creation itsel soud be delivert frae the slavery o corruptness intil the liberty o the glorie o the bairns o god
5158,ROM,8,SCO1904,for we ken that a creation is maenin thegither and travailin thegither in bearinpangs till noo
5159,ROM,8,SCO1904,and no only sae but een we wha hae the firstfrute o the spirit een we oorsels within oorsels are maenin fainwaitin for adoption the redeemin o oor body
5160,ROM,8,SCO1904,for in hope we are savt but hope beheld isna hope for what ane sees why dis he hope for
5161,ROM,8,SCO1904,but gin what we seena we hope for than patiently we wait fain to hae it
5162,ROM,8,SCO1904,and in that vera way the spirit is giean us help in oor weakness for een what we soud be prayin for i the way we soud we kenna but the spirit himsel helps oor intercessions wi fainness o desire no to be uttert
5163,ROM,8,SCO1904,and he wha redds oot the heart kens what the spirit appruves for it is conform to god he pleads on behauf o the saunts
5164,ROM,8,SCO1904,but we div ken that to them wha love god a things work thegither for gude to thae wha are bidden anes conform to his purpose
5165,ROM,8,SCO1904,for wham he afore appruved he afore appointit conform to the likeness o his son that he micht be firstborn o mony brethren

5167,ROM,8,SCO1904,than what sal we say to thir things gin god be on oor side wha is again us
5168,ROM,8,SCO1904,he wha hainedna his ain son but gied him up for us a sal he no wi the gift o him gie us a things in his lovin favor
5169,ROM,8,SCO1904,wha sal wyte gods chosen anes god wha declares them richtous

5171,ROM,8,SCO1904,wha sal sinder us frae christs love sal trouble or dool or persecution or famine or nakitness or skaith or sword
5172,ROM,8,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon for thy sake are we gien ower to death the hail day lang we are coontit as sheep for the slauchter
5173,ROM,8,SCO1904,but in a thir things we are victorious and mair nor victorious by him wha loved us
5174,ROM,8,SCO1904,for i am perswadit that no life and no death nor angels nor heigh pooers
5175,ROM,8,SCO1904,nor heigh things nor laigh things nor ony ither creatit thing sal hae pooer to sinder us frae gods love whilk is in christ jesus oor lord
5176,ROM,9,SCO1904,the truth i say in christ i amna speakin fause my conscience bein witnessin alang wi mysel in the spirit
5177,ROM,9,SCO1904,that thar is muckle dool to me and constant sorrow i my heart
5178,ROM,9,SCO1904,for i mysel could hae wisst mysel
5179,ROM,9,SCO1904,devotit by christ for my brethrens sake my kin eftir the flesh
5180,ROM,9,SCO1904,wha truly are israelites whase are the adoption and glorie and covenant and law and services and promises
5181,ROM,9,SCO1904,whase are the patriarchs and o wham accordin to the flesh is the christ he wha is heigher than a god blessed for aye
5182,ROM,9,SCO1904,but no in sic mainner as tho the promises o god had failed for no a wha are o isral are truly isral
5183,ROM,9,SCO1904,nor yet gin they be a seed o abram are they a bairns but in isaac sal thar be coontit thee a seed
5184,ROM,9,SCO1904,thus no the bairns o the flesh are bairns o god but the bairns o the promise are coontit as the seed
5185,ROM,9,SCO1904,for this word is ane o promise at this time sal i come and thar sal be to sarah a son
5186,ROM,9,SCO1904,and no only sae but whan rebecca had conceivt by ane een by oor faither isaac
5187,ROM,9,SCO1904,for they no bein yet born nor had dune gude or bad that the purpose o god conform to choice soud remain no o warks but o him wha invitit
5188,ROM,9,SCO1904,it was said to her the elder sal ser the younger
5189,ROM,9,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon jaucob i loed esau i appruvdna
5190,ROM,9,SCO1904,what than sal we say is ony wrangdoin wi god far frae it
5191,ROM,9,SCO1904,for to moses he says i wull hae mercie on whamsoeer i can hae compassion
5192,ROM,9,SCO1904,sae than it is naither o him that wad hae it nor o him that rins fort but o god wha gies mercie
5193,ROM,9,SCO1904,for the scriptur says to pharaoh for this vera thing i raist thee up that i micht schaw in thee my pooer sae as my name soud be kent in a the yirth
5194,ROM,9,SCO1904,and sae he
5195,ROM,9,SCO1904,has mercie on wham he pleases and wham he wull he gars harden
5196,ROM,9,SCO1904,ye may say to me than hoo than dis he wyte for wha can staun again his wull
5197,ROM,9,SCO1904,na o man wha are ye to be answerin god again sal the thing made say to him wha made it why did thou mak me sae
5198,ROM,9,SCO1904,or hasna the potter a richt ower the clay oot o the same dadd to mak ae pot to honor but anither to a want o honor
5199,ROM,9,SCO1904,what tho god desirin to schaw his anger and to mak kent his pooer tholed wi unco patience the veschels o wrath that had become fit for destruction
5200,ROM,9,SCO1904,and that he micht mak kent his rich glorie on veschels o mercie he had afore prepart for glorie
5201,ROM,9,SCO1904,wham he had bidden een us no only frae amang jews but frae amang the nations as weel
5202,ROM,9,SCO1904,een as he says by hosea i wull ca her that wasna my folk my folk and her that wasna weelbelovd my weelbeloved
5203,ROM,9,SCO1904,and it sal be i the place whaur it was said ye arena my folk een thar sal they be cad bairns o the leevin god
5204,ROM,9,SCO1904,and esaiah too cries oot aboot isral een gin the number o israls bairns be as the sand o the sea a wheen left sal be saved
5205,ROM,9,SCO1904,for a perfete and close reckonin wull the lord mak on the yirth
5206,ROM,9,SCO1904,een as esaiah said afore gin the lord o hosts hadna left us a seed we wad hae been as sodom and wad hae been like to gomorrah
5207,ROM,9,SCO1904,what than are we to say this that the nations thae wha warna cairryin on richtousness nanetheless laid haud o a richtousness a richtousness a the same that it was by faith
5208,ROM,9,SCO1904,whilst isral tho cairryin on a rule o richtousness didna win their way to that rule
5209,ROM,9,SCO1904,and why juist this that they war cairryin it on no by faith but as it war by warks they stumblt at that stane o stumblin
5210,ROM,9,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon behauld i set in zion a stane o stumblin and a rock o offendin and he wha lippens thartill sal no be putten to shame
5211,ROM,10,SCO1904,brethren the fain desire o my heart and its prayer to god on their behauf is for their salvation
5212,ROM,10,SCO1904,for i gie witness to them that thay hae a zeal for god but no conform to wisdom
5213,ROM,10,SCO1904,for no takin to them gods richtousness and aye seekin to upbigg their ain richtousness they didna gie in to the richtousness o god
5214,ROM,10,SCO1904,for christ is what the law ettles
5215,ROM,10,SCO1904,at i the way o richtousness to ilka ane wha has faith
5216,ROM,10,SCO1904,for moses has putten doon anent the richtousness whilk is by the law the man wha dis them sal leeve by them
5217,ROM,10,SCO1904,whauras the richtousness o faith speaks like this ye maunna say i yere heart wha sal speel up intil heeven that is for to fesh christ doon
5218,ROM,10,SCO1904,or wha sal lowt doon intil the abyss that is for to raise up christ frae amang the deid
5219,ROM,10,SCO1904,but what says it that whilk is spoken o is narhaund ye in yere mooth and in yere heart that is the thing o the faith spoken o whilk thing we mak kent
5220,ROM,10,SCO1904,that gin ye confess wi yere mou that jesus is lord and hae faith i yere heart that god raised him frae amang the deid ye sal be saved
5221,ROM,10,SCO1904,for in the heart ane has faith for richtousness and the confession o anes mou to salvation
5222,ROM,10,SCO1904,for sae says the scriptur nane that trust in him sal be putten to shame
5223,ROM,10,SCO1904,for thar is nae differ atween jews and greeks for the same lord o a is bountifu to a that cry to him
5224,ROM,10,SCO1904,for ilka ane a and every wha may ca on the name o the lord sal be saved
5225,ROM,10,SCO1904,hoo than soud they ca on ane on wham they haena lippened and hoo sal they lippen ane they haena heardtell o and hoo wull they hear ginna some ane publishes
5226,ROM,10,SCO1904,and hoo sal they publish gin they warna sent oot een as it is putten doon hoo bonnie are the feet o thae bringin us a joyfumessage o gude things
5227,ROM,10,SCO1904,but they didna a meekly hear the joyfumessage for esaiah says lord wha lippens what we proclaim
5228,ROM,10,SCO1904,and sae faith comes oot o what is heard and hearin comes by the word that is anent christ
5229,ROM,10,SCO1904,but say i did they no hear aye indeed intil a the yirth gaed their voice and to the ends o the inhabititwarld what they spak
5230,ROM,10,SCO1904,again say i didna isral come to ken first quo moses i wull mak ye to be jealous ower a naenation and anent a glaikit nation wull i gar ye be angry
5231,ROM,10,SCO1904,but esaiah is ventursome and quo he i was fund o thae wha sochtmena i cam to be kent o thae wha speirtna eftir me
5232,ROM,10,SCO1904,but anent isral he says the hail day lang raxt i oot my hauns to a dour and thrawartspeakin folk
5233,ROM,11,SCO1904,i speir than has god cuisen awa his folk far frae it i mysel am an isralite o abrams seed o benjamins tribe
5234,ROM,11,SCO1904,god disna cast awa his folk he had afore appruvd wat ye na anent elijah what the scriptur says as he pled wi god again isral
5235,ROM,11,SCO1904,lord thy prophets hae they slain and thy altars hae they dung doon and i am left allenar and they seek for my life
5236,ROM,11,SCO1904,but what says the answer to him i hae keepit for mysel seeven thoosand men wha haena loutit a knee to baal
5237,ROM,11,SCO1904,sae than een at this present thar is a wee wheen left by way o a favorin choice
5238,ROM,11,SCO1904,but gin it be by favor it is nae mair o warks else the favor isna favor
5239,ROM,11,SCO1904,weel what that whilk isral socht eftir the same they forgathertna wi but the chosen anes forgathert wit whauras the lave war bleart and saw na
5240,ROM,11,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon god gae them a spirit that was sleeperie een that they seena wi and lugs they hearna wi till this vera day
5241,ROM,11,SCO1904,and dauvid says be their buird a snare and a girn and a stumbling and an illreturn to them
5242,ROM,11,SCO1904,be their een bleart that they mayna see and their back be aye loutit doon
5243,ROM,11,SCO1904,but i say stumblt they to the end they micht fa far frae it but throwe the illdaen o them salvation cam to the nations to steer them up to be jealous
5244,ROM,11,SCO1904,and noo gin their illdaen was like muckle gear to the warld and their loss like muckle gear to the nations hoo muckle mair their abundance
5245,ROM,11,SCO1904,but to you am i sayin this you o the nations inasmuckle as i am an apostle to the nations my office i mak muckle o
5246,ROM,11,SCO1904,gin by ony means i may steer up to be jealous my ain flesh and save some frae mang them
5247,ROM,11,SCO1904,for gin the castinawa o them was a warlds bringinin what sal the acceptin o them be but like life frae the deid
5248,ROM,11,SCO1904,and gin the first frute was holie the book ot maun be holie as weel and gin the rute was holie een sae the branches
5249,ROM,11,SCO1904,and gin some o the branches war taen awa while ye bein a wild olive war graftit in amang them and was made wi them to share o the rute o the fatness o the olive
5250,ROM,11,SCO1904,haudna yere heid aboon the branches but gin ye boast ken that ye bearna the rute but the rute you
5251,ROM,11,SCO1904,ye may say the branches war taen awa that i micht be graftit in
5252,ROM,11,SCO1904,weel throwe their want o faith they war broken and ye by yere faith are staunin lookna at lofty things but hae fear
5253,ROM,11,SCO1904,for gin god sparedna the nateral branches tak tent that he sparena you
5254,ROM,11,SCO1904,gie tent than to gods kindness and rigor upon thae that fell rigor but upon you gods kindness gin aiblins ye bide aye in the kindness else een ye sal be cuttit oot
5255,ROM,11,SCO1904,and een they except aiblins they still bide in their lack o faith sal be graftit in for god can graft them in again
5256,ROM,11,SCO1904,for gin ye war cuttitoot frae the nateral wildolive and ayont natur war graftit intil a gude olive hoo muckle mair sal thir the nateral branches be graftit intil their ain olive tree
5257,ROM,11,SCO1904,for i wadna hae ye no to ken this mystery brethren least ye be ower wyss in yere ain een that a bleartness to a degree has come on isral till the abundance o the nations sal come in
5258,ROM,11,SCO1904,and sae a isral sal be saved een as it is putten doon the deliverer sal come oot o zion he wull pit awa the ungodliness o jaucob
5259,ROM,11,SCO1904,and this is my covenant wi them i the day that i tak awa their sins
5260,ROM,11,SCO1904,anent the joyfumessage they are contrar tye but as to the choosn they are weel looed for the faithers sake
5261,ROM,11,SCO1904,god never rues his biddin or his gifts
5262,ROM,11,SCO1904,for een as ye war at ae time dour toward god but at this time hae gotten mercie by their dourness
5263,ROM,11,SCO1904,sae thir war dour that by yere mercie they too may win mercie
5264,ROM,11,SCO1904,for god has coontit them a dour that he soud hae mercie on them a
5265,ROM,11,SCO1904,o deepness o gods riches and wisdom and knowledge hoo unfathomable his judgments and his ways unsearchable
5266,ROM,11,SCO1904,for wha kent the lords mind or wha becam his coonsellor

5403,1CO,1,SCO1904,for it has been signifyt to me anent ye my brethren by thae o chloe that strifes are amang ye
5404,1CO,1,SCO1904,but this say i that ilk ane o ye says i am o paul and i am o apollos and i o peter and i o christ
5405,1CO,1,SCO1904,has christ been sindert was paul crucifyt in yere behauf or intil pauls name war ye bapteezt
5406,1CO,1,SCO1904,i gie thanks to god that nane o ye i bapteezt gin it warna crispus and gaius

5410,1CO,1,SCO1904,for the message o the cross is but havers to thae wha perish hoobeit to thae wha are rescued een to us it is the pooer o god
5411,1CO,1,SCO1904,for it is putten doon i destroy the wisdom o the wyss anes and set aside the discernment o the discernin anes
5412,1CO,1,SCO1904,whaur is a wyss ane whaur a writer whaur a disputer o this warld hasna god made the wisdom o the warld witlessness
5413,1CO,1,SCO1904,for seein that i the wisdom o the warld the warld kentna god throwe its wisdom it was gods gude pleasur throwe the witlessness o preachin to save them that hae faith
5414,1CO,1,SCO1904,for baith jews for ferlies are speirin and greeks for wisdom are seekin
5415,1CO,1,SCO1904,whauras we proclaim a messiah wha has been crucifyt to the jews indeed a stumblinclog but to the greeks folly
5416,1CO,1,SCO1904,nanetheless to the bidden anes theirsels baith jews and greeks a messiah the pooer o god and the wisdom o god
5417,1CO,1,SCO1904,for the folly o god is wysser nor men and the weakness o god michtier nor men
5418,1CO,1,SCO1904,for look at yere bidden brethren that no mony wyse accordin to the flesh no mony o pooer no mony heigh anes war chosen
5419,1CO,1,SCO1904,on the contrar god chose the witless things o the warld that he soud shame thae that are wyss and the weak things o the warld god waled to shame the things that are michty
5420,1CO,1,SCO1904,and the laigh things o the warld and the gecktat things god waled things no existin that existin things micht be brocht to nocht
5421,1CO,1,SCO1904,sae as nae flesh soud boast in gods presence
5422,1CO,1,SCO1904,but o him are ye in christ jesus wha has made wisdom frae god to us and richtousness and santification and redemption
5423,1CO,1,SCO1904,sae as it is puttendoon he that boasts lat him boast i the lord
5424,1CO,2,SCO1904,and i whan i cam to ye brethren camna i the way o speech or wisdom that excelled bringin to ye gods testimonie
5425,1CO,2,SCO1904,for i set doon my fit to ken naething amang ye but jesus christ and him as ane that had been crucifyt
5426,1CO,2,SCO1904,and i cam in fecklessness and shrinking and wi muckle fear to be wi ye
5427,1CO,2,SCO1904,and my speech and my message warna wi wheedlin words o the wyss but in demonstration o spirit and pooer
5428,1CO,2,SCO1904,sae that yere faith needna staun in mens wisdom but in gods pooer
5429,1CO,2,SCO1904,wisdom nanetheless we speak amang experienced anes wisdom hoobeit no o this warld nor o the great men o this warld wha are to be a puttenby
5430,1CO,2,SCO1904,but we speak gods wisdom in a riddle the knowledge that had been keepit hidlins whilk god designed aforehaun afore a time for oor glorie
5431,1CO,2,SCO1904,that no ane o the great anes o this warld has come to ken for had they come to ken they wadna i that case hae crucifyt the lord o glorie
5432,1CO,2,SCO1904,but een as it is putten doon whatna things the ee
5433,1CO,2,SCO1904,sawna and the ear heardna and mans heart conceivtna sae mony things has god prepared for thae that loe him
5434,1CO,2,SCO1904,to us nanetheless has god revealt them by the spirit for the spirit kens a things een the deep things o god
5435,1CO,2,SCO1904,for wha o men kens mans things but mans spirit that is in him sae nane kens the things o god but gods spirit
5436,1CO,2,SCO1904,but we gat no the warlds spirit but the spirit that is o god sae as we soud ken the things god gies to us by his favor
5437,1CO,2,SCO1904,whilk things eke we speak no in mantaught words o lear but in words spirittaught to spiritual men spiritual things exponin
5438,1CO,2,SCO1904,but a man o flesh taksna in the things o gods spirit for they are daftness to him and he canna get to ken them for that they are to be spiritually redd oot
5439,1CO,2,SCO1904,but the spiritual man speirs oot a things but he his sel is speirt oot by nane
5440,1CO,2,SCO1904,for wha cam to ken the lords mind that he micht gie him lear but we hae christs mind
5441,1CO,3,SCO1904,and i brethren could only speak to ye as men o flesh as bairns in christ and no as to spiritual men
5442,1CO,3,SCO1904,wi milk i fed ye and no wi meat for ye warna yet able fort nay een yet ye arena able
5443,1CO,3,SCO1904,for ye are yet fleshly for whaur thar are amang ye jealousy and strife areyena fleshly and gaunon as men
5444,1CO,3,SCO1904,for whan ane says i in sooth am o paul but anither i am o apollos are ye no fleshly men
5445,1CO,3,SCO1904,wha than is apollos and wha is paul juist servants throwe wham ye believt een as the maister gied to ilk ane
5446,1CO,3,SCO1904,i plantit apollos watirt but god maks to growe
5447,1CO,3,SCO1904,sae than naither he that plants is onything nor he that watirs but god that maks to growe
5448,1CO,3,SCO1904,and he that plants and he that watirs are baith ane hoobeit ilk ane sal hae his ain reward een as his labour sal be
5449,1CO,3,SCO1904,for we are gods fellowworkers and ye are gods mailin gods biggin
5450,1CO,3,SCO1904,een as the favor o god was gien me as a wyss bigginmaister i lay a fundation and anither biggs ont but lat ilk ane tak tent hoo he biggs tharon
5451,1CO,3,SCO1904,for ocht ither fundation nane can lay but that whilk is laid that is jesus christ
5452,1CO,3,SCO1904,but gin ony ane is upbiggin on the fundation wi gowd siller precious gems wud gerss stibble

5457,1CO,3,SCO1904,kenyena that ye are a temple o god and gods spirit is dwallin in ye
5458,1CO,3,SCO1904,gin ony man destroy gods temple him wull god
5459,1CO,3,SCO1904,destroy for the temple o god is holie whilk in sooth are ye
5460,1CO,3,SCO1904,lat nae ane delude his sel gin ony ane thinks he is wyss amang ye i this warld lat him become witless in order that he may become wyss
5461,1CO,3,SCO1904,for the wisdom o this warld is daftness wi god for it is puttendoon he snares the wyss wi their ain pawkiness
5462,1CO,3,SCO1904,and ance mair the lord taks tent o the reasonins o the wyss that they are havers
5463,1CO,3,SCO1904,sae lat nane boast o men for a things are yere ain
5464,1CO,3,SCO1904,gin aiblins it be paul or apollos or peter or the warld or life or death or things wi us or things to be a are yere ain
5465,1CO,3,SCO1904,but ye are christs but christ is gods
5466,1CO,4,SCO1904,sae lat a man pit us doon as actin for christ as awmoners o gods secret things
5467,1CO,4,SCO1904,and here too it is necessar that awmoners be fund honest
5468,1CO,4,SCO1904,but wi me it is a sma thing that i soud be judged by you or on
5469,1CO,4,SCO1904,mans day aye i amna een judgin mysel
5470,1CO,4,SCO1904,for i ken nocht to wyte mysel wi but this disna mak me richtous but he wha judges me is the lord
5471,1CO,4,SCO1904,and sae judge nocht owersune till the time the lord comes wha wull baith mak plain the hidlin things o the mirkness and wull schaw the thochts o the hearts and than ilk anes commendin sal come frae god
5472,1CO,4,SCO1904,but thir things brethren i hae sae to speak taen to mysel and apollos for yere sakes sae as in us ye micht learn the lear no to gang ayont what is puttendoon that ye soudna be swallin yersels up ilk ane again anither
5473,1CO,4,SCO1904,for wha maks a differ atween ye and what hae ye that ye didna receive noo gin ye received it why soud ye swall up yersel as gin ye didna receive it
5474,1CO,4,SCO1904,een noo hae ye become stawd een noo hae ye become rich allenarlie and sindry frae us ye hae gotten to be kings and i wad ye war kings that een we micht reign alang wye
5475,1CO,4,SCO1904,for sae it seems to me god has set forth us the apostles hinmaist as gien ower to the deid for a spectacle are we made to the warld to angels and to men
5476,1CO,4,SCO1904,we are made fules for the name o christ but ye are wyss in christ we are feckless but ye are strang ye are honored but we dishonored
5477,1CO,4,SCO1904,een to this oor we hae hunger and drooth and nakitness are clourd and cuistenoot
5478,1CO,4,SCO1904,we toil workin wi oor ain hauns whan miscad we bless whan persecutit we thole it
5479,1CO,4,SCO1904,whan defamed we entreat we are made as the middenheap o the warld the dightins and orts o a things een to this day
5480,1CO,4,SCO1904,no to shame ye dae i say thir things on the contrar i admonish ye as my weelloed bairns
5481,1CO,4,SCO1904,for it may be that ye hae ten thoosand teachers in christ yet surely no mony faithers for in christ jesus i becam yere faither i the joyfumessage
5482,1CO,4,SCO1904,i entreat ye than that ye be as i am
5483,1CO,4,SCO1904,for this reason i send to ye timothy wha is my bairn belovd and faithfu i the lord wha wull gar ye to ca to mind my ways whilk are in christ een as i teach in a places in ilka kirk

5487,1CO,4,SCO1904,whatna o them wad ye hae soud i come tye wi a rod or in love and the spirit o meekness
5488,1CO,5,SCO1904,it is the common clash that thar is uncleanness amang ye and sic uncleanness as is no een to be heard o amang the nations that ane soud hae his faithers wife

5523,1CO,7,SCO1904,but anent what ye wrate to me it is gude for a man no to be bund to a wumman
5524,1CO,7,SCO1904,yet because o uncleanness lat ilk man hae his ain wife and ilk wumman her ain man
5525,1CO,7,SCO1904,lat the husband render to the wife what is due and in siclike mainner the wife as weel to the husband
5526,1CO,7,SCO1904,the wife hasna authoritie ower her ain body but the husband and in siclike mainner the husband hasna authoritie ower his ain body but the wife
5527,1CO,7,SCO1904,defraudyena ane the ither unless aiblins it may be for a wee by consent that ye may hae mair time for prayer and forgather again lest sautin tempt ye wi incontinence
5528,1CO,7,SCO1904,this hoobeit i am saying by permission and no o commandment
5529,1CO,7,SCO1904,i coud wuss a man to be like mysel but ilka ane has his ain gift frae god ane this and anither that
5530,1CO,7,SCO1904,nanetheless say i to the unmarryt and to weedows weel for them gin aiblins they bide een as i am
5531,1CO,7,SCO1904,but gin they haena continency lat them mairry for better ist to mairry than to be ower fain
5532,1CO,7,SCO1904,to the mairryt hoobeit i gie chairge yet no i but the lord that a wife gangna awa frae her husband
5533,1CO,7,SCO1904,but gin aiblins she een be sindert lat her bide unmairryt or else be reconcilt to her husband and latna a husband pit awa a wife
5534,1CO,7,SCO1904,and to the lave say i no the lord gin a brither hae a wife and she believesna and gin she hersel is weelpleased to dwell wi him lat him no send her awa
5535,1CO,7,SCO1904,and a wife wha has a husband that believesna gin he his sel is weelpleased to dwall wi her lat her no lea her husband
5536,1CO,7,SCO1904,for the misbelievin husband is sanctifyt in the wife and the misbelievin wife is sanctifyt in the husband itherways as the case is yere
5537,1CO,7,SCO1904,bairns war unclean but noo are they holie
5538,1CO,7,SCO1904,hoobeit gin the misbelievin husband is unyoking his sel lat him be unyokin his sel the brither or the sister hasna come into bondage in sic like but god has enjoined upon us peace
5539,1CO,7,SCO1904,for hoo ken ye o wife but ye may save yere husband or hoo ken ye o husband but you may save yere wife
5540,1CO,7,SCO1904,but whether sae ilk ane as the lord has portioned oot to him ilk ane as god has fund him and cad him sae lat him be walkin and sae enjoin i in a the kirks
5541,1CO,7,SCO1904,haein been circumceesed whan ane was cad lat him no be uncircumceesed in uncircumceesion was ony ane cad lat him no become circumceesed
5542,1CO,7,SCO1904,circumcession is naething and uncircumceesion is naething but the keepin o gods commandments is athing
5543,1CO,7,SCO1904,ilk ane in the mainner o life in whilk he was cad sae abide
5544,1CO,7,SCO1904,a thirlman war ye whan cad lat it no fash ye but gin ye hae choice to be free tak it
5545,1CO,7,SCO1904,for he that in the lord was cad whan a thirlman is emancipate i the lord in siclike he wha was cad as a free man is a bondman in the lord
5546,1CO,7,SCO1904,ye war coft wi a price becomena servants o men
5547,1CO,7,SCO1904,lat ilk ane in that state in whilk he was cad abide wi god
5548,1CO,7,SCO1904,but anent thae that are maidens i hae nae commauns o the lord but i gie ye my mind as ane that has had mercie frae the lord to be true and leal
5549,1CO,7,SCO1904,this than i wad say is seemlie i the case by stress of existin things that it is weel for a man sae to be
5550,1CO,7,SCO1904,hae ye become bund to a wife seekna to be lowsed are ye lowsed frae a wife seekna a wife
5551,1CO,7,SCO1904,but gin ye een mairry ye haena sinned and gin a maiden mairry she hasna sinned nanetheless sic wull hae tossinsaboot i the flesh but i spare ye
5552,1CO,7,SCO1904,but een this say i brethren the time is wearin dune lat them wi wives be as gin they had nane
5553,1CO,7,SCO1904,and them greetin as gin they gratna and them rejoicin as gin they rejoicedna and them buyin as gin they obteendna
5554,1CO,7,SCO1904,and them usin the warld as no bundup int for the form o this warld is passin awa
5555,1CO,7,SCO1904,moreover i wad ye war free frae carkin care the man no mairryt is tentie aboot the lords things hoo he may pleasur the lord
5556,1CO,7,SCO1904,whauras the man mairryt is tentie aboot his wifes maitters hoo he may pleasur his wife and sae is dividit
5557,1CO,7,SCO1904,and thar is a differ atween a wife and a maiden she that is no mairryt is tentie aboot the lords things sae as she may be holie in body and spirit whauras she that is mairryt is tentie anent the warlds things hoo she may pleasur her husband
5558,1CO,7,SCO1904,this speak i wi an ee to yere ain gude no that i wad cast a snare ower ye but wi an ee to what is seemly and that ye may wait on the lord untrammlt
5559,1CO,7,SCO1904,but gin ony man thinks he disna weel by his maiden gin she pass the flooer o her age and need be lat him do as he wad he isna committin sin lat them wed
5560,1CO,7,SCO1904,nanetheless he that stauns siccar in his heart no bein under necessity but has pooer as anent his ain wull and has made it up in his ain heart to keep his maiden dis weel
5561,1CO,7,SCO1904,sae baith he wha gies in mairriage his ain maiden dochter dis weel and he wha disna gie in mairriage dis een better
5562,1CO,7,SCO1904,a wife is bund as lang as her husband leeves but gin aiblins her husband is faun asleep she is free to mairry wham she wull only in the lord
5563,1CO,7,SCO1904,but happier gin she thus abide in my judgment and mair i think i hae the spirit o god
5564,1CO,8,SCO1904,noo anent eidolsacrifeeces we ken that we a hae knowledge knowledge swalls up but love upbiggs
5565,1CO,8,SCO1904,gif ony man thinks he kens a thing he hasna yet gotten to ken onything as he soud ken
5566,1CO,8,SCO1904,but gif ony man loes god the same man is appruvt o god
5567,1CO,8,SCO1904,anent eidolsacrifeeces we ken weel that an eidol is naething i the warld and that thar is nae god but ane
5568,1CO,8,SCO1904,for een gin thar be saecad gods gin they be in heeven or yirth een as thar are gods mony and lords mony
5569,1CO,8,SCO1904,but to us thar is ae god the faither by wham are a things and we for him and ae lord jesus christ throwe wham are a things and we throwe him
5570,1CO,8,SCO1904,hoobeit that lear is no in a but some trokin
5571,1CO,8,SCO1904,wi the eidol een till noo wi the eidol as a sacrifeece eat and their conscience bein unco waff is defiled
5572,1CO,8,SCO1904,but meat willna gar us win ben to god naither gin aiblins we eatna div we fa short nor aiblins gin we eat div we excel
5573,1CO,8,SCO1904,but tak ye tent that by nae means this freedom is made a stumbling clog for the weak
5574,1CO,8,SCO1904,for gin aiblins ane soud see you wha has knowledge sittin in an eidols temple at meat wullna his weak conscience be made bauld to eat the eidolsacrifeeces
5575,1CO,8,SCO1904,sae than the weak ane the brither christ deet for is brocht to ruin by yere knowledge
5576,1CO,8,SCO1904,but in sae sinnin again the brethren and clouring their conscience whilk is weak ye are sinnin again christ
5577,1CO,8,SCO1904,sae in ony case ava whaur meat is a snare to my brither ise in naewise eat flesh for evermair that i makna my brither to stoiter

5592,1CO,9,SCO1904,een sae has the lord ordeened that they that declare the gudeword sal hae their breid o the gudeword

5610,1CO,10,SCO1904,hoobeit wi mony o them was god illpleased and he dang them ower i the wilderness
5611,1CO,10,SCO1904,noo in thir things they becam lessons to us that we soudna glaum at ill things as eke they glaumd
5612,1CO,10,SCO1904,nor worship eidols as some o them juist as it is putten doon the folk sut doon to eat and drink and raise up to mak sport
5613,1CO,10,SCO1904,naither lat us do uncleanness as some o them did uncleanness and fell in ae day thrieandtwenty thoosand

5620,1CO,10,SCO1904,whaurfor my loved anes flee frae eidolworship
5621,1CO,10,SCO1904,as to discernin men i speak judge ye what i am sayin
5622,1CO,10,SCO1904,the cup o blessin we bless istna the sharin o the blude o christ the laif that we brek istna the sharin o the body o christ
5623,1CO,10,SCO1904,seein that we tho mony are a ae laif ae body for we a o the ae laif partak
5624,1CO,10,SCO1904,look again at isral accordin to the flesh arena they wha eat the sacrifeeces sharin wi the altar
5625,1CO,10,SCO1904,yet am i sayin that an eidolsacrifeece is onything or that an eidol is onything
5626,1CO,10,SCO1904,on the contrar what things the nations sacrifeece to the demons do they sacrifeece and no to god and i wadna hae ye to become marrows wi demons
5627,1CO,10,SCO1904,ye canna be drinkin the lords cup and demons cup ye canna be sharers o the lords table and demons table
5628,1CO,10,SCO1904,wad ye provoke the lord to jealousie are we sterker than he
5629,1CO,10,SCO1904,a things are alloot but a things arena for profit a things are alloot but a things strengthenna
5630,1CO,10,SCO1904,lat nae ane be seekin allenarlie eftir his ain things but that whilk is his neebors
5631,1CO,10,SCO1904,whatsaeer is sellt i the merkits eat speirinnane on behauf o conscience
5632,1CO,10,SCO1904,for the hail yirth is the lords and a its ootcome

5634,1CO,10,SCO1904,but gin aiblins ane say tye this is a holie sacrifeece eatna for the sake o him wha said sae and for conscience sake
5635,1CO,10,SCO1904,conscience say i no yere ain but the ithers for hoo soud my liberty be evened by anither mans conscience
5636,1CO,10,SCO1904,gin i gratefully am partakin why am i to be spoken again anent that whilk i am giean thanks ower
5637,1CO,10,SCO1904,sae gin ye be eatin or drinkin or doin ocht be doin a to the glorie o god
5638,1CO,10,SCO1904,be ye free frae offence baith to jews and to greeks and to the kirk o god
5639,1CO,10,SCO1904,accordin as i too am pleasin a men no lookin for my ain gain but the gain o the mony that they may be savt
5640,1CO,11,SCO1904,be ye like me een as i follow christ
5641,1CO,11,SCO1904,i gie ye praise that in a things ye hae mind o me and een as i gied to ye the precepts ye are haudin them siccar
5642,1CO,11,SCO1904,but i wad hae ye ken that the heid o ilka man is christ and the heid o a wumman is the man and the heid o christ is god
5643,1CO,11,SCO1904,ony man prayin or preachin haein ocht on his head pits his heid under shame
5644,1CO,11,SCO1904,but a wumman prayin or preachin wi her heid unveilt pits her heid to shame for it is as gin she had been shaven
5645,1CO,11,SCO1904,for gin a wumman disna cover hersel lat her hair eke be shorn but gin it be shamefu in a wumman to be shorn or shaven lat her be covert
5646,1CO,11,SCO1904,for a man soudna cover his heid inasmuckle as he is gods image and glorie but the wumman is mans glorie
5647,1CO,11,SCO1904,for the man is no o the wumman but the wumman o the man
5648,1CO,11,SCO1904,for naither was man made for the sake o the wumman but wumman for the sake o the man
5649,1CO,11,SCO1904,for sae soud the wumman wear this permission on her heid conscious o the angels
5650,1CO,11,SCO1904,hoobeit naither is the man wantin the wumman nor the wumman wantin the man in the lord
5651,1CO,11,SCO1904,for een as the wumman is o the man sae is the man throwe the wumman but a things are o god
5652,1CO,11,SCO1904,think for yere ain sels ist seemly for a wumman uncovert to be prayin to god
5653,1CO,11,SCO1904,disna een natur tell ye that a man gin aiblins he has lang hair it is a discredit to him
5654,1CO,11,SCO1904,whauras a wumman gin aiblins she hae lang hair it is a glorie to her for the lang hair has been gien to her for a coverin
5655,1CO,11,SCO1904,gin hoobeit ony ane thinks to be contrar nae sic custom as this hae we nor yet the kirks o god
5656,1CO,11,SCO1904,but i gie ye this chairge no to praise ye ava for that ye arena comin thegither for the better but for the waur
5657,1CO,11,SCO1904,for to begin tho ye div indeed come thegither i the kirk i am tellt that factions amang ye are springing up and i somewhat believe it
5658,1CO,11,SCO1904,for pairties amang ye thar maun be that they that are acceptit amang ye may be schawn
5659,1CO,11,SCO1904,and sae though ye come thegither intil ae place it isna to eat the lords supper
5660,1CO,11,SCO1904,for ilk ane has his ain supper afore eatin and sae ane is hungry and anither is steght
5661,1CO,11,SCO1904,what haeyena hooses to eat and drink in or div ye belittle gods kirk and shame thae that hae nocht what am i to say tye am i to compliment ye i complimentyena
5662,1CO,11,SCO1904,for i had frae the lord what i een tellt to you that the lord jesus that nicht in whilk he was betrayt took a laif
5663,1CO,11,SCO1904,and giean thanks brak it and said this is my body that is gien for you this do in memory o me
5664,1CO,11,SCO1904,and in like mainner the cup too eftir the takin o supper sayin this cup is the new covenant in my blude this div ye een as aft as ye may drink ot for the remembrance o me
5665,1CO,11,SCO1904,for sae aften as ye may be eatin this laif and drinkin this cup ye are setting forth the death o the lord till whatna time he may come
5666,1CO,11,SCO1904,sae whasoeer may be eatin the laif or drinkin the cup o the lord in an unwordie way sal be hauden for the body and the bluid o the lord
5667,1CO,11,SCO1904,but lat a man pit his sel to the test and in sic mainner lat him eat o the laif and drink o the cup
5668,1CO,11,SCO1904,for he that is eatin and drinkin is eatin and drinkin condemnation to himsel gin he bena
5669,1CO,11,SCO1904,consecratin the body
5670,1CO,11,SCO1904,and sae thar are amang ye a hantle weak and pinin and a gude wheen fain asleep
5671,1CO,11,SCO1904,gin hoobeit we had been consecrating oorsels we wadna i that case hae been comin aneath condemnation
5672,1CO,11,SCO1904,but bein brocht aneath judgment by the lord we are chastent that we soudna be condemned wi the warld
5673,1CO,11,SCO1904,and sae ye my brethren whan ye come thegither to eat wait ye ane for anither
5674,1CO,11,SCO1904,gin ony man hunger lat him eat at hame least ye but come thegither for condemnation and for the lave ot whan i come i wull set a in order
5675,1CO,12,SCO1904,noo anent the spiritual brethren i wadna hae ye i the mirk
5676,1CO,12,SCO1904,ye weel ken that whan ye war gentiles ye war led to their dumb eidols hoosoeer ye micht be airtit
5677,1CO,12,SCO1904,and sae i gie ye to ken that nane speakin wi gods spirit maks oot jesus to be
5678,1CO,12,SCO1904,accurst and that nae ane can mak oot jesus to be lord but wi the holie spirit
5679,1CO,12,SCO1904,but braidliescattert gifts thar are yet the ae spirit
5680,1CO,12,SCO1904,and braidliescattert service yet the ae lord
5681,1CO,12,SCO1904,and braidscatterin o inward wark thar is and aye the ae god wha works inwardly a things in a men
5682,1CO,12,SCO1904,but to ilk ane is gien this schawinforth o the spirit to work whateer is best
5683,1CO,12,SCO1904,for to ane is gien indeed throwe the spirit a word o inner wisdom to anither the word o ootward knowledge by the same spirit
5684,1CO,12,SCO1904,to anither faith by the ae spirit but to anither gifts for healin by the same spirit
5685,1CO,12,SCO1904,to anither ane wunnerwarks and pooers to anither speakin for god to anither discernin o spirits to anither mony tongues but to anither interpretin o tongues
5686,1CO,12,SCO1904,but a thir dae that ae and the selfsame spirit work inwardly giean oot to ilk ane allenarlie een as he wull
5687,1CO,12,SCO1904,for een as the body is ane and has a hantle o members but a the members o the body mony as they may be are ae body sae een in christ
5688,1CO,12,SCO1904,for in ae spirit are we a in ae body bapteezt aither jews or greeks aither bond or free and war made to a drink o ae spirit
5689,1CO,12,SCO1904,for the body isna ae member but mony
5690,1CO,12,SCO1904,gin aiblins the fit soud say for that i amna the haun i amna o the body ist than no o the body
5691,1CO,12,SCO1904,and gin aiblins the lug soud say for that i amna an ee i amna o the body ist than no o the body
5692,1CO,12,SCO1904,gin the hail o the body war ee whaur the hearin or gin the hail hearin whaur the smellin
5693,1CO,12,SCO1904,but noo god plantit the members ilk o them i the body juist as he pleased
5694,1CO,12,SCO1904,gin hoobeit a had been ae member whaur the body
5695,1CO,12,SCO1904,whauras noo a hantle o members yet indeed but ae body

5742,1CO,14,SCO1904,sae that tongues are for a testimonie no to thae that hae faith but to thae wantin faith but prophecie isna for thae that are wantin faith but for they wha hae faith
5743,1CO,14,SCO1904,for gin the hail kirk come thegither for the ae thing and a be speakin wi tongues and thar come in men ungiftit or wantin faith wull they no report ye are wud

5751,1CO,14,SCO1904,but gin aiblins to anither a revelation is made as he is sittin lat the first be quate
5752,1CO,14,SCO1904,for ane by ane ye can a prophesy that a may learn and a hae consolation
5753,1CO,14,SCO1904,and the spirits o the prophets are ruled by the prophets
5754,1CO,14,SCO1904,for god isna a god o tulzies but o peace as in a the kirks o the saunts
5755,1CO,14,SCO1904,as for the wives lat them be quate i the kirks for it isna allood them to be speakin but lat them be in submission een as says the law
5756,1CO,14,SCO1904,but gin they wad fain learn onything lat them speir at their ain husbands at hame for it isna seemly for a wife to be speakin i the kirk

5765,1CO,15,SCO1904,and that he was buryt and that he has been raised on the third day as said the scripturs
5766,1CO,15,SCO1904,and that he schawed his sel to peter eftir to the twal
5767,1CO,15,SCO1904,eftir that he schawed his sel to mair nor fyve hunder brethren at ance the feck o them remainin till noo but a wheen are faun asleep

5787,1CO,15,SCO1904,the last fae that is dune awa wi is death
5788,1CO,15,SCO1904,for a things are to be putten aneath his feet but whaur ane says a things hae been putten aneath it is plain that thar is an exception o the ane wha pat a things aneath him
5789,1CO,15,SCO1904,but whan a things are putten aneath him than sal the son his sel become subject to the ane wha made a things subject to him that the godheid may be a in a

5878,2CO,2,SCO1904,unco sorrow sic a ane soud be swallowt up
5879,2CO,2,SCO1904,and sae i entreat ye to mak siccar your love to him
5880,2CO,2,SCO1904,for een to this end i wrate sae as i soud hae prufe o you gin in a things ye war obedient
5881,2CO,2,SCO1904,noo to ane ye forgie ocht i too for een i what i hae forgien whaur i forgie ocht for your sakes i forgie it afore christ
5882,2CO,2,SCO1904,sae as we bena ootmatched wi sautan for we arena ignorant o his deceits
5883,2CO,2,SCO1904,forby whan i cam to troas for christs joyfumessage and a door was unsteekit to me in the lord
5884,2CO,2,SCO1904,i had nae comfort in my saul at no finding my brither titus but biddin them godspeed i gaed oot intil macedonia
5885,2CO,2,SCO1904,but to god be praise wha at a seasons gars us triumph in christ and maks the sweet savor o his knowledge kent in ilka place throwe us
5886,2CO,2,SCO1904,that we are a sweet savor o christ to god in thae that are saved and in thae that are tint
5887,2CO,2,SCO1904,in thir soothly a savor oot o death deathlike but in thae a savor oot o life lifelike and for thir things wha is aiqual
5888,2CO,2,SCO1904,for we arena as a hantle are corruptin the word o god but in a aefauldness as o god in the sicht o god we speak o christ
5889,2CO,3,SCO1904,are we to begin again to roose oorsels or hae we need as a wheen ithers o letters o commendation to ye or frae ye
5890,2CO,3,SCO1904,yere ain sels are oor letter written in oor hearts kent and read o a men
5891,2CO,3,SCO1904,schawin yersels that ye are a message o christ delivert by us inscrivit no wi ink but wi spirit o the leevin god no in tablets o stane but in tablets in hearts o flesh
5892,2CO,3,SCO1904,and siccan certaintie as this hae we throwe christ toward god
5893,2CO,3,SCO1904,no as we war o oor ainsels able sae as to reckon onything o oorsels but oor ability is o god
5894,2CO,3,SCO1904,wha een made us able to be messengers o a new covenant no o letter but o spirit for the letter slays but the spirit maks leevin
5895,2CO,3,SCO1904,but gin the message o death inscrivit in stane cam amid glorie sae that the children o isral warna fu able to look intil moses face for the glorie o his face whilk glorie was to come till an end
5896,2CO,3,SCO1904,hoo soudna raither the message o the spirit be in glorie
5897,2CO,3,SCO1904,for gin the message o condemnation was in glorie muckle mair the message o richtousness is fu o glorie
5898,2CO,3,SCO1904,for in sooth that whilk was made glorious had nae glorie in comparison on accoont o the
5899,2CO,3,SCO1904,greater glorie
5900,2CO,3,SCO1904,for gif that whilk was to pass awa cam wi glorie muckle mair that whilk is to bide has glorie
5901,2CO,3,SCO1904,haein than siccan a hope we use unco plainness o speech
5902,2CO,3,SCO1904,and no like moses wha pat a veil ower his face sae that the children o isral soudna fulook to the end o that whilk was passin awa
5903,2CO,3,SCO1904,but their minds war drumlie for een to this vera day the same veil remains at the readin o the auld covenant no taen awa for to be taen awa in christ
5904,2CO,3,SCO1904,but to this day whaneer moses is read a veil ower their hearts is lyin
5905,2CO,3,SCO1904,hoobeit whansoeer a heart may turn toward the lord the veil is to be liftit aff
5906,2CO,3,SCO1904,noo the lord is the spirit and whaureer the lords spirit is thar is liberty
5907,2CO,3,SCO1904,but we a wi unveilt face receivin and reflectin the glorie o the lord are cheenged intil the selfsame image frae glorie on to glorie as frae the lord the spirit
5908,2CO,4,SCO1904,and sae haein this message een as we had mercie gien us we didna gie a up
5909,2CO,4,SCO1904,but we disowned the secret things o shame and gangna in deceit nor in a twafauld way dealin wi the word o god but by the schawin o the truth seekin favor o ilk mans conscience i the sicht o god
5910,2CO,4,SCO1904,but gin aiblins oor joyfumessage has onyway come till ye veilt to them wha war perishin it cam to be veilt
5911,2CO,4,SCO1904,in wham the god o this warld made drumlie their perceptions least they soud discern the brichtness o christs joyfumessage o glorie wha is the image o god
5912,2CO,4,SCO1904,for we proclaimna oor ain sels but christ jesus as lord and oorsels as yere servitors for jesus sake
5913,2CO,4,SCO1904,for god wha said oot o the mirk lat licht shine has lichtitup oor hearts to gie the licht o the knowledge o god i the face o christ
5914,2CO,4,SCO1904,but we hae this treasur in veschels o clay that the owermasterin o the pooer may be o god and no o us
5915,2CO,4,SCO1904,on ilka side pressed sair but no helpless switherin but no lackin escape
5916,2CO,4,SCO1904,pursued but no abandoned dung doon but no made an end o
5917,2CO,4,SCO1904,aye bearin aboot i the body the puttentodeid o jesus that sae een the life o jesus micht be schawn in oor body
5918,2CO,4,SCO1904,for evermair we the leevin are delivert up tae death for jesus sake that jesus life micht be schawn in oor mortal flesh
5919,2CO,4,SCO1904,sae that death is wrocht in us inwardly but life in you
5920,2CO,4,SCO1904,hoobeit we hae the same spirit o faith conform to what is puttendoon i had faith tharfor spak i sae we hae faith and tharfor spak
5921,2CO,4,SCO1904,lippenin that he wha raised up the lord jesus wull also wi jesus raise us and wull present us wi you
5922,2CO,4,SCO1904,for a things are for yere sakes sae that wi grace aboundin throwe the mony it may mak the praise to abound the mair to the glorie o god
5923,2CO,4,SCO1904,tharfor we arena faintheartit but een tho oor ootward man dwines awa yet oor inward man is ilka day renewin
5924,2CO,4,SCO1904,for the wee bit passin sorrow that we hae is workin oot for us aye mair and mair a mair excellent and eternal wecht o glorie
5925,2CO,4,SCO1904,sae lang as we lookna for things seen but for things unseen for the seen things are but for a time but the things no seen are for aye
5926,2CO,5,SCO1904,for we ken that gin aiblins oor yirdly sheilin be taen doon we hae a biggin o god a dwallin no made wi hauns eternal i the heevens
5927,2CO,5,SCO1904,for truly in this behauf we maen unco fain to hae spread ower us oor hoose whilk is o heeven
5928,2CO,5,SCO1904,gin sae that bein covert we sanna be fund nakit
5929,2CO,5,SCO1904,and vera truly we that are i the sheilin dae maen bein hauden doon yet we arena fain to be uncovert but raither to cover oorsels ower that what is mortal micht be swallowt up in immortality
5930,2CO,5,SCO1904,noo he wha wrocht us oot for this vera thing is god wha een gied to us the firstfrutes o the spirit
5931,2CO,5,SCO1904,haein gude heart at a times kennin that whiles bidin i the body we are awa frae the lord
5932,2CO,5,SCO1904,for we are gaun on by faith and no by oor ain een
5933,2CO,5,SCO1904,we hae gude heart nanetheless and are pleased raither to gang frae oot the body and to come ben to the lord
5934,2CO,5,SCO1904,and sae we are unco fain be we at hame or awa frae hame to pleasur him
5935,2CO,5,SCO1904,for we maun a be made seen at the bar o christ that ilk ane may hae conform to the things dune i the body een as he has dune be they gude or ill
5936,2CO,5,SCO1904,kennin than the dreid o the lord we perswad men but to god we are weelkent and i wad hope that een in yere consciences we hae been made weelkent
5937,2CO,5,SCO1904,we dinna commend oorsels again to ye but gie ye opportunity to commend us that ye may hae something for thae wha boast o their ootward things and no in heart
5938,2CO,5,SCO1904,for een gin we war daft it was for god or are douce and grave it is for you
5939,2CO,5,SCO1904,for christs love rinks us in for we sae judge that gin ane deet for a than in consequence a deet
5940,2CO,5,SCO1904,and he deet for a that the leevin soud leeve nae langer to their sels but for him wha on their behauf deet and raise again
5941,2CO,5,SCO1904,sae that we frae this oot ken nae man conform to the flesh een gin we hae conform to the flesh kent the messiah yet noo frae this oot in siclike ken we him nae mair
5942,2CO,5,SCO1904,sae than gif ony man is in christ thar is a new creation auld things hae gane by lo a things are made new
5943,2CO,5,SCO1904,but they are a o god wha reconcilt us to himsel throwe christ and gied to us the message o reconciliation
5944,2CO,5,SCO1904,hoo that god in christ was reconcilin the world to his ain sel no coontin up to them their sins and did pit in us the message o the reconciliation
5945,2CO,5,SCO1904,for christ than are we envoys as gin god war entreatin throwe us we beseech for christ be ye reconcilt to god
5946,2CO,5,SCO1904,him that kent nae sin has he made for us to be as
5947,2CO,5,SCO1904,sin that ye micht come to be a richtousness o god
5948,2CO,6,SCO1904,workin thegither wi him we entreat ye no to receive the tenderlove o god in vain
5949,2CO,6,SCO1904,for he says at a favorable time i heard ye and in a day o salvation i befreendit ye tak tent noo a favorable time lo noo a day o salvation
5950,2CO,6,SCO1904,giean nae occasion o stumblin in onything that oor ministration bena wytit

5964,2CO,6,SCO1904,or whatna aneness has a temple o god wi eidols for ye are a temple o god wha is a leevin god een as god said i wull dwall in them and gang in them and wull be their god and they sal be my folk
5965,2CO,6,SCO1904,whaurfor come ye oot o their mids and be ye allenar says the lord and touchna the unclean thing
5966,2CO,6,SCO1904,and i wull tak ye in and be a faither to ye and ye sal be to me for sons and dochters says the lord almichty
5967,2CO,7,SCO1904,haein than thir promises belovd anes lat us mak oorsels free frae uncleanness o flesh and saul makin holiness perfete i the fear o god
5968,2CO,7,SCO1904,gie us a place in yere hearts we wrangd nane we corruptit nane we defraudit nane
5969,2CO,7,SCO1904,i amna sayin this to wyte ye for as i hae said afore ye are in oor hearts to leeve and dee wi you
5970,2CO,7,SCO1904,an unco freedom o speech hae i tye unco boastin hae i o ye i am fu o comfort i am unco filled wi joy in a oor troubles
5971,2CO,7,SCO1904,for een whan we cam intil macedonia oor flesh had nae rest but in a ways war we in a tulzie ootwardlie fechts inwardlie switherins
5972,2CO,7,SCO1904,but he wha comforts the humble anes comfortit us een god by the comin o titus
5973,2CO,7,SCO1904,and no allenar by his comin but by the comfort whaurby he was comfortit on yere accoont whan tellin us o yere fain desire yere lamentation yere zeal for me sae that i rejoiced the mair
5974,2CO,7,SCO1904,for gin een i made ye wae wi the letter i amna regrettin tho i did regret for i see that yon letter made ye wae een gin it was but an oor
5975,2CO,7,SCO1904,but noo i am blythe no that ye war made wae but that ye war made wae to repentance for ye war made wae accordin to god that ye micht hae damage frae us in naething
5976,2CO,7,SCO1904,for dool accordin to god works repentance to salvation no to be regrettit but the dool o the warldskind works oot death
5977,2CO,7,SCO1904,for behauld this vera thing the makin wae accordin to god what unco tentiness it wrocht in ye what judgin o yer sels what sair indignation what fear what fain desire what zeal what repayin in a things ye hae schawn yersels to be pure in this maitter
5978,2CO,7,SCO1904,and sae een gin i wrate tye it wasna for his sake that did the wrang nor for his sake wha dreed the wrang but that oor care on yere behauf micht be made kent tye in gods sicht
5979,2CO,7,SCO1904,and on this accoont we hae been comfortit but mair we did rejoice uncolie i the joy o titus that his heart was refresht by ye a
5980,2CO,7,SCO1904,sae gin i hae boastit onywise o you to him i wasna made to be shamed but as we tellt ye a things truly sae oor boastin afore titus was seen to be true
5981,2CO,7,SCO1904,and his tenderlove is a the mair toward ye whan he cas to mind the obedience o ye a and hoo wi fear and trimlin ye received him
5982,2CO,7,SCO1904,i joy than that in a things i can lippen ye
5983,2CO,8,SCO1904,forby we mak kent tye brethren the favor o god schawn to the kirks o macedonia
5984,2CO,8,SCO1904,that in a great trial o sorrow the rowth o their joy aboundit intil a rich liberality
5985,2CO,8,SCO1904,that accordin to their pooer aye een ayont their pooer o their ain accord
5986,2CO,8,SCO1904,they prayed us wi entreaty as to takin pairt in the giean to the saunts
5987,2CO,8,SCO1904,and far
5988,2CO,8,SCO1904,ayont oor hopes giean their ain sels first to the lord and to us by gods wull
5989,2CO,8,SCO1904,sae that we exhortit titus that as he had made a beginnin he soud also perfete in you this favor as weel
5990,2CO,8,SCO1904,and sae as in a things ye abound in faith and speech and knowledge and diligence and in love to us ye micht abound too in this grace
5991,2CO,8,SCO1904,no by way o commaun div i speak but for pittin the quality o yere love to the test on accoont o ithers readiness
5992,2CO,8,SCO1904,for ye understaun the love o oor lord jesus christ in that he made his sel puir for yere sakes tho he was rich that ye throwe his poortith micht be made rich
5993,2CO,8,SCO1904,and in this i gie ye my mind for this is weel for you wha indeed begude a year syne no only to do but also to wull
5994,2CO,8,SCO1904,and noo perfete the doin ot that een accordin to the readiness to wull thar may be the cairryin oot o what ye hae
5995,2CO,8,SCO1904,for gin the readiness to wull is set forth accordin to what a man has it is appruvt and no accordin to what he has no
5996,2CO,8,SCO1904,for i dinna say that ithers soud hae ease and ye be burdened
5997,2CO,8,SCO1904,but by an aiqualsharin yere rowth enoo soud be for their want that their rowth soud een come to be for yere want that thar may be aiquality
5998,2CO,8,SCO1904,een as it is putten doon he that gaithert the mair had nane ower muckle and he that gaithert the less lackedna
5999,2CO,8,SCO1904,but god be praised wha pat the same anxiety in the mind o titus anent ye
6000,2CO,8,SCO1904,for tho he acceptit the exhortation yet bein his sel unco diligent he gaed till ye o his ain wull
6001,2CO,8,SCO1904,and we joined wi him the brither whase praise in the word is throwe a the kirks
6002,2CO,8,SCO1904,and no only sae but wha was deputit by the kirks to travel wi us in this behauf whilk is serd by us to the lords glorie and to schaw oor zeal
6003,2CO,8,SCO1904,haein it sae that nae ane soud wyte us in this bounty we are awmoners o
6004,2CO,8,SCO1904,providin honorable things baith in the sicht o the lord and afore men
6005,2CO,8,SCO1904,and we hae jointly sent wi them oor brither wham we hae testit in mony things at a times and fund diligent but noo muckle mair sae wi the unco confidence he has toward ye
6006,2CO,8,SCO1904,whether is it onything aboot titus a pairtner o mine and a fellowworker wi you or aboot oor brethren they are apostles to the kirks and the glorie o christ
6007,2CO,8,SCO1904,ye did schaw tharfor afore the kirks the exhibition o yere love and oor boastin on yere behauf tae them
6008,2CO,9,SCO1904,for anent the service for the saunts it is needless for me to write to ye
6009,2CO,9,SCO1904,for i ken yere readiness o mind for whilk i roose ye afore them o macedonia that greece was ready a year syne and yere zeal has steered up the lave
6010,2CO,9,SCO1904,but i hae sent the brethren least oor boast on yere behauf soud be in vain in this respect that as i said ye micht be prepart
6011,2CO,9,SCO1904,least gif aiblins macedonians cam wi me and faund ye no ready we that we mayna be sayin ye soud be putten to shame i this confidence
6012,2CO,9,SCO1904,sae i thocht it necessar to exhort the brethren that they soud gang forrit till ye and mak up aforehaun yere promised liberality sae as it micht be ready as a gift gien and no a thing extortit
6013,2CO,9,SCO1904,but as tae this he wha saws sparely sal een reap sparely and wha saws wi blessins sal een reap wi blessins
6014,2CO,9,SCO1904,ilk ane sae een as he had it in his heart no o sweirness nor o necessity for god loes a cheerfu giver
6015,2CO,9,SCO1904,but god has pooer to mak a favor to abound wi unco rowth toward ye sae that in a things and at a times haein a sort o plenty o yere ain ye may abound mair and mair in a gude warks
6016,2CO,9,SCO1904,as it is putten doon he disponed abreid he gied to the puir his richtousness bides for aye
6017,2CO,9,SCO1904,noo he wha gies seed to the sawer and breid for eatin sal supply and mak lairge yere seed sawn and mak to flourish the ootcome o yere richtousness
6018,2CO,9,SCO1904,in a things bein made rich to a liberality whilk is workin oot praise to god
6019,2CO,9,SCO1904,for the cairryinoot o this public service isna only makin up for the lack o the saunts but is
6020,2CO,9,SCO1904,frutefu o mony praises to god
6021,2CO,9,SCO1904,for that mony throwe this workinoot o this service are magnifyin god for the obedience o yere confession to the word o christ and for the aefauldness o yere gifts for them and for a
6022,2CO,9,SCO1904,they their sels wi prayers on yere behauf are unco fain for the wonderfu favor o god to ye
6023,2CO,9,SCO1904,praise be to god for his unmeasurable bounty
6024,2CO,10,SCO1904,noo i paul mysel entreat ye by the meekness and canniness o christ wha ootwardly to the een am lowly amang ye but as awa am bauld toward ye
6025,2CO,10,SCO1904,i entreat hoobeit that bein present i mayna be bauld wi the bauldness i wad hae again a wheen wha look on us as gin we gaed accordin to the flesh
6026,2CO,10,SCO1904,for tho we are walkin i the flesh we arena battlin conform to the flesh
6027,2CO,10,SCO1904,for the wapins o oor warfare arena fleshly but strang wi god for dingin doon stranghaulds
6028,2CO,10,SCO1904,puin doon lofty thochts and ilka heigh thing that wad heize up itsel contrar to the knowledge o god and takin captive ilka motive intil subjection to christ
6029,2CO,10,SCO1904,and haudin oorsels ready to avenge a disobedience whansaeer yere obedience may be seen
6030,2CO,10,SCO1904,are ye lookin at things accordin to their appearance gin ony man thinks he is christs lat him think thus again till his sel that een as he is christs sae are we christs
6031,2CO,10,SCO1904,for gif indeed muckle mair i soud boast a wee o oor poor whilk the lord gae for upbiggin and no for dingin ye doon i sanna be putten to shame
6032,2CO,10,SCO1904,that i maunna seem as gin aiblins i wad gliff ye wi a letter
6033,2CO,10,SCO1904,for his letters says ane are vera true wechty and o pooer but his bodily presence is waff and his
6034,2CO,10,SCO1904,discoorse o nae account
6035,2CO,10,SCO1904,but lat siccan a ane ken that o whatna sort we are in oor letters whan we are awa sae sal we be whan present in oor wark
6036,2CO,10,SCO1904,for we arena bauld to even oorsels wi some wha speak weel o their sels but they measurin their sels amang their sels and evenin their sels wi their sels are wantin in gude understaunin
6037,2CO,10,SCO1904,we hoobeit no as regairds unmeasurt things wull boast oor sels but by the rule god has measurt to us to extend een to the lenth o you
6038,2CO,10,SCO1904,for it isna as gin we raxtna the lenth o you or war raxin oor sels unduly for een the lenth o you war we aforehaun wi the gudeword o christ
6039,2CO,10,SCO1904,no as boastin o unmeasurt things in ither mens labors but haudin a hope by yere strang faith o bein enlairged accordin to oor measur for mair abundance
6040,2CO,10,SCO1904,intil the districts ayont ye to cairry the gudeword and no by ony ithers rule o things made ready to boast
6041,2CO,10,SCO1904,but wha may boast lat him boast i the lord
6042,2CO,10,SCO1904,for it isna the ane that speaks weel o his sel the lord is pleased wi but the ane the lord speaks weel o
6043,2CO,11,SCO1904,i wad that ye coud thole me in a wee fulishness indeed ye are tholin me
6044,2CO,11,SCO1904,for i am jealous ower ye wi the jealousy o god for i espoused ye to ae husband that i micht gie ye ower as a pure maiden to christ
6045,2CO,11,SCO1904,but i fear least in onywise een as the serpent beguiled eve wi his craft sae yere minds soud be airtit awa frae the aefauldness and purity that are for christ
6046,2CO,11,SCO1904,for gin ane comin brings ye anither jesus wham we brochtna or ye receive anither spirit wham ye haena received or anither gudeword that ye haena welcomed ye micht weel
6047,2CO,11,SCO1904,thole him
6048,2CO,11,SCO1904,for i reckon to hae come nane short o the maist preeminent apostles
6049,2CO,11,SCO1904,but gin i war
6050,2CO,11,SCO1904,plain in my speech yet no wantin in lear but in a ways we made it kent in a things to you

6117,GAL,1,SCO1904,the peace and gude favor o god the faither tye and oor lord jesus christ
6118,GAL,1,SCO1904,wha gied his sel for oor sins that he micht deliver us oot o this present warld whilk is an ill ane conform to the wull o oor god and faither
6119,GAL,1,SCO1904,to wham be glorie for evir and evir amen
6120,GAL,1,SCO1904,i ferlie that thus sae sune ye are changin frae him wha perswadit ye intil christs love intil some ither gudeword
6121,GAL,1,SCO1904,whilk indeed isna
6122,GAL,1,SCO1904,anither gudeword but that are some wha are fashin ye and wad damage the gudeword o christ
6123,GAL,1,SCO1904,but een aiblins it soud be we or an angel frae heeven wha soud bring ye anither gudeword differin frae what we gied tye lat him be accurst
6124,GAL,1,SCO1904,as said we syne sae say i noo again gin ony ane gies ye a gudeword differin frae what ye gat lat him be accurst
6125,GAL,1,SCO1904,for at this time div i perswad men or dis god or div i seek to please men if aye i am pleasin men christs servant amina
6126,GAL,1,SCO1904,for i mak kent tye brethren as to the gudework whilk was tellt by me that it isna conform to men
6127,GAL,1,SCO1904,for naither did i frae man obteen it nor was i learned it by man but throwe a revealin o jesus christ
6128,GAL,1,SCO1904,for ye heard as anent my mainner o life at ae time in judaism that in an unco way i persecutit the kirk o god and laid it waste
6129,GAL,1,SCO1904,and was gaun on in judaism ayont my marrows amang my ain folk bein unco zealous for the traditions o my forebears
6130,GAL,1,SCO1904,but wham it pleased god wha took me sindry frae my mithers womb and invitit me by his grace
6131,GAL,1,SCO1904,to reveal his son in me that i soud deliver the gudeword regairdin him amang the heathen at ance i coonselltna wi flesh and blude
6132,GAL,1,SCO1904,nor gaed i up to jerusalem to them that war apostles afore me but i gaed awa intil arabia and cam back again to damascus
6133,GAL,1,SCO1904,than thrie years eftir i gaed up to jerusalem to get acquant wi peter and bade wi him fyfteen days
6134,GAL,1,SCO1904,but o the lave o the apostles saw i nane but james the brither o the lord
6135,GAL,1,SCO1904,noo as to whatna things i am tellin ye tent ye in presence o god i amna speakin fause
6136,GAL,1,SCO1904,and syne i gaed intil the kintra o syria and cilicia
6137,GAL,1,SCO1904,forby i wasna kent by face to the kirks o judea whilk are in christ
6138,GAL,1,SCO1904,only they war hearin he wha was persecutin us at ae time is noo preachin the joyfumessage o the faith that ance he laid waste
6139,GAL,1,SCO1904,and they magnifyt god in me
6140,GAL,2,SCO1904,than in the coorse o fowrteen year i gaed up again to jerusalem wi barnabas takin titus as weel
6141,GAL,2,SCO1904,and i gaed up by revelation and laid afore them the gudeword whilk i preach amang the nations to their sels privately hoobeit wi thae o distinction
6142,GAL,2,SCO1904,least by ony means i soud run or had been rinnin in vain
6143,GAL,2,SCO1904,and no een titus wha was wi me tho he was a greek was compelled to be circumceesed
6144,GAL,2,SCO1904,and this was on accoont o fause brethren secretly brocht in wha cam in but to spy oot oor liberty whilk we hae in christ jesus that sae they soud bring us intil bondage
6145,GAL,2,SCO1904,to wham no een for an oor gied we place by siccan a submission that the truth o the gudeword micht still bide wi you
6146,GAL,2,SCO1904,but frae thae held to be in repute whatsoeer they war at ae time is naething to me god accepts nae mans face thae o repute addit naething to me
6147,GAL,2,SCO1904,but on the contrar seein i was entrustit wi the gudeword to the uncircumceesion een as peter was to the circumceesion
6148,GAL,2,SCO1904,for he that wrocht in peter for an apostleship o the circumceesion wrocht een in me for the heathen
6149,GAL,2,SCO1904,and seein the favor whilk was gien to me james and peter and john wha war reputit pillars gied to me and barnabas a richt haun o britherhood that we soud gang to the heathen and they to the circumceesion
6150,GAL,2,SCO1904,only that we soud be mindfu o the puir as to whilk i was een fu o zeal this vera thing to do
6151,GAL,2,SCO1904,but whan peter cam to antioch i stude up again him to his face for that he was to be wytit
6152,GAL,2,SCO1904,for afore certain anes cam frae james he did eat wi the gentiles but whan they cam he held back and keepit his sel allenar in fear o thae o the circumceesion
6153,GAL,2,SCO1904,and the lave war usin this doobleness wi him sae that een barnabas was cairryt awa wi their deceit
6154,GAL,2,SCO1904,but whan i saw they warna gangin upricht i the truth i the gudeword quo i to peter afore them a gin ye bein a jew to begin wi leeve in a gentile way and no in a jewish mainner hoo div ye gar gentiles to be judaizin
6155,GAL,2,SCO1904,we jews by natur and no sinners frae amang gentiles
6156,GAL,2,SCO1904,kennin that a man isna justifyt by warks o law but only throwe faith in christ jesus een we pit oor faith in christ jesus that we soud be justifyt by faith in christ and no by warks o law for by warks o law sal nae flesh be justifyt
6157,GAL,2,SCO1904,gin hoobeit tho seekin for justification in christ een we oorsels are fund sinners is christ than a bringerin o sin far frae it
6158,GAL,2,SCO1904,for gin i bigg up again whatna things i pu doon i schaw mysel to be guilty
6159,GAL,2,SCO1904,for i throwe law deet to the law that i soud leeve to god
6160,GAL,2,SCO1904,i hae become crucifyt wi christ nay i leeve allenar nae langer but christ is leevin in me and the life i noo hae i the flesh i leeve i the faith o the son o god wha loed me and gied his sel up on my behauf
6161,GAL,2,SCO1904,i amna settin aside the grace o god for gin throwe law is richtousness christ maun hae deet in vain
6162,GAL,3,SCO1904,o glaikit galations wha cuist glamour ower ye afore whase vera een jesus christ was clearly schawn as a crucifyt ane
6163,GAL,3,SCO1904,i wad but ken this frae ye wast by the warks o the law that ye hae gotten the spirit or by the hearin o faith
6164,GAL,3,SCO1904,are ye sae glaikit eftir makin a beginnin i the spirit are ye noo gaun to be perfitit i the flesh
6165,GAL,3,SCO1904,tholed ye sic things for nocht gin it yet be for nocht
6166,GAL,3,SCO1904,he than that supplyt to ye the spirit and wrocht ferlies amang ye did he it by warks o the law or by hearin o faith
6167,GAL,3,SCO1904,een as abram lippened god and it was reckoned to him as richtousness
6168,GAL,3,SCO1904,ken than that they o faith een they are bairns o abram
6169,GAL,3,SCO1904,and the scriptur lookin forrit to god justifyin the heathen throwe faith announced aforehaun the gudeword to abram they sal be blest in thee een a the nations
6170,GAL,3,SCO1904,sae than they o faith are haein a blessin alang wi faithfu abram
6171,GAL,3,SCO1904,for as mony as are o lawwarks are neath a curse for it is putten doon accurst is ilka ane wha gangsna on in a things i the buik o the law to do them
6172,GAL,3,SCO1904,but that in law nae ane is hauden richtous wi god is plain for the richtous ane sal leeve by faith
6173,GAL,3,SCO1904,but the law isna by faith on the contrar he wha dis them sal leeve in them
6174,GAL,3,SCO1904,christ redeemed us oot o the curse o the law bein made a curse on oor behauf for it is putten doon accurst is ilka ane hingin on a tree
6175,GAL,3,SCO1904,sae that to the nations the blessin o abram micht come in jesus christ that we soud hae the promise o the spirit by faith
6176,GAL,3,SCO1904,brethren humanly am i speakin yet a human covenant nae ane sets by or adds to
6177,GAL,3,SCO1904,noo to abram war the promises spoken and to his seed it disna say and to seeds as o mony but as o ane and to thy seed whilk is christ
6178,GAL,3,SCO1904,but say i a covenant een afore made siccar by god the law whilk eftir fowr hunner and thretty years cam in disna pit by that it soud mak the promise feckless
6179,GAL,3,SCO1904,for gin aiblins the inheritance is by law it is nae langer by promise but to abram by promise had god bestown it
6180,GAL,3,SCO1904,why than the law for the cause o sin it was addit till siccan a time as the seed to wham it was promised soud come whilk law was gien in chairge by messengers at the haun o a mediator
6181,GAL,3,SCO1904,but the mediator isna o ane but god is
6182,GAL,3,SCO1904,ane
6183,GAL,3,SCO1904,was the law than contrar to the promises o god far frae it for gin a law war gien that had pooer to gie life truly than by law soud hae been richtousness
6184,GAL,3,SCO1904,but the scriptur steekit up a things as aneath sin that the promise by faith in jesus christ soud be gien to thae that hae faith
6185,GAL,3,SCO1904,but afore faith cam we war keepit siccar neath the law shut in to the faith aboot to be made kent
6186,GAL,3,SCO1904,sae that the law has been oor bairnkeeper to tak us to christ that we soud throwe faith be declart richtous
6187,GAL,3,SCO1904,but faith haein come we are nae mair aneath a bairnkeeper
6188,GAL,3,SCO1904,for ye are a sons o god throwe the faith in jesus christ
6189,GAL,3,SCO1904,for ye as mony as war bapteezt into christ hae putten on christ
6190,GAL,3,SCO1904,thar isna to be said jew nor greek thar isna to be said bond nor free thar isna to be said male nor female for a ye thegither are ane in christ jesus
6191,GAL,3,SCO1904,and gin ye are christs than are ye abrams seed and heirs een as said the promise
6192,GAL,4,SCO1904,but i say sae long as the heir is a bairn he differsna frae a servant een tho aiblins he be the laird o a
6193,GAL,4,SCO1904,but is aneath bairnkeepers and overseers till the time set by the faither
6194,GAL,4,SCO1904,sae we too whan we war bairns war keepit in bonds to the
6195,GAL,4,SCO1904,hornbuik o the warld
6196,GAL,4,SCO1904,but whan the fu time cam god sent oot his son wha cam o a wumman wha cam aneath the law
6197,GAL,4,SCO1904,that he micht redeem thae aneath the law sae that we coud receive the adoption o bairns
6198,GAL,4,SCO1904,and mair for that ye are sons god sent oot his sons spirit into oor hearts cryin oot abba faither
6199,GAL,4,SCO1904,sae ye are nae mair a servant but a bairn and gin a bairn than an heir throwe god
6200,GAL,4,SCO1904,but than in sooth no kennin god ye war in bondage neath thae that war by natur nae gods
6201,GAL,4,SCO1904,whauras noo eftir that ye hae owned god or raither been owned o him hoo ist that ye are gaun back again to the feckless and beggarlie beginnins to whilk ye wad fain ower again be in bondage
6202,GAL,4,SCO1904,ye preceesely observe days and months and years
6203,GAL,4,SCO1904,i am feart for ye least by ony means i hae toiled for ye in vain
6204,GAL,4,SCO1904,become ye as i for that i too becam as yersels brethren i entreat ye in naething did ye wrang me
6205,GAL,4,SCO1904,but ye ken hoo that by reason o a weakness i the flesh i preached to ye the gudeword at the first
6206,GAL,4,SCO1904,and the temptation ye saw i my flesh ye despisedna nor scunnert at it but took me to yere hearts as an angel o god as christ jesus
6207,GAL,4,SCO1904,whaur than is that happiness o yours for i witness tye that gin it had been possible yere ain een wad ye hae pykit oot and gien to me
6208,GAL,4,SCO1904,sae noo hae i gotten to be yere fae for that i deal leal wi ye
6209,GAL,4,SCO1904,they zealouslie seek ye but no in a gude way aye they wad
6210,GAL,4,SCO1904,steek ye oot that ye may seek eftir them
6211,GAL,4,SCO1904,but it is gude for a gude thing to be socht eftir wi zeal at a times and no only whan i am wi ye
6212,GAL,4,SCO1904,my bairns o wham again i am in birthpangs till siccan a time as christ be formed in you
6213,GAL,4,SCO1904,aye i coud wiss to be wi ye enoo and to change my speech for i am in a swither aboot ye
6214,GAL,4,SCO1904,but tell me ye that wad fain be neath the law div ye no hear the law
6215,GAL,4,SCO1904,for it is puttendoon abram had twa sons ane by a bondmaid and ane by a free wumman
6216,GAL,4,SCO1904,but the ane by the bondmaid hoobeit was born eftir the mainner o the flesh whauras the ane by the free wumman throwe a promise
6217,GAL,4,SCO1904,whilk things in sooth are a parable for thir weemen are twa covenants ane frae mount sinai bringin forth to bondage whilk in sooth is hagar
6218,GAL,4,SCO1904,for hagar is mount sinai in arabia and is like to jerusalem that noo is and is in bondage wi her bairns
6219,GAL,4,SCO1904,but the jerusalem aboon is free wha indeed is mither to us a
6220,GAL,4,SCO1904,for it is puttendoon rejoice ye barren that burena brek oot intil shouts ye that warna in birthpangs for mair are the bairns o the desolat than o her that has the husband
6221,GAL,4,SCO1904,but we brethren eftir the mainner o isaac are bairns o the promise
6222,GAL,4,SCO1904,but just as than the ane born eftir the flesh persecutit the ane born eftir the spirit een sae is it enoo
6223,GAL,4,SCO1904,but what says the scriptur pit ye oot the bondmaid and her son for in naegate sal the bairn o the bondmaid inherit alang wi the bairn o the free
6224,GAL,4,SCO1904,sae brethren we arena the bondmaids bairns but the free wummans
6225,GAL,5,SCO1904,wi freedom christ maks us free staun ye steive than and bena hauden fast wi ony yoke o bondage
6226,GAL,5,SCO1904,tak tent i paul say tye that gin ye receive circumceesion christ wull profit ye nocht
6227,GAL,5,SCO1904,but i witness to ilka man again that receives circumceesion that he is a bund debtor to the hail law
6228,GAL,5,SCO1904,ye are set aside frae christ ye wha wad be justifyt i the law ye are faun awa frae his favor
6229,GAL,5,SCO1904,for we throwe the spirit are fain waitin for the hope o richtousness
6230,GAL,5,SCO1904,for in christ jesus naither circumceesion coonts for ocht nor uncircumceesion but faith wrocht inwardly by love
6231,GAL,5,SCO1904,ye gaed weel wha taiglt ye that ye soudna comply wi the truth
6232,GAL,5,SCO1904,this compliance wasna o him wha cad ye

6234,GAL,5,SCO1904,i am perswadit o ye i the lord that ye winna be thrawart but he that fashes ye sal dree his weird whaeer he may aiblins be
6235,GAL,5,SCO1904,but i brethren gin i be preachin circumceesion why am i sae persecutit for than had the bogle o the cross been dune awa
6236,GAL,5,SCO1904,i wad they een wad cut aff their sels that fash ye
6237,GAL,5,SCO1904,for ye war cad in freedom brethren but turnna yere freedom intil an indulgence to the flesh but raither by yere love ser ye ane anither
6238,GAL,5,SCO1904,for the hail law is bund up in ae word this ye sal loe yere neebor as yersel
6239,GAL,5,SCO1904,but gin ye gansh at and devoor ane anither tak tent that ye bena destroyt ane o anither
6240,GAL,5,SCO1904,on the ither haun i say walk ye i the spirit and the wull o the flesh ye sanna fulfil
6241,GAL,5,SCO1904,for the flesh has desires contrar to the spirit and the spirit contrar to the flesh for thir again ane anither are set that ye
6242,GAL,5,SCO1904,mayna do the things ye wad itherwise do
6243,GAL,5,SCO1904,but gin than ye are led by the spirit ye arena under the law
6244,GAL,5,SCO1904,but plain to be seen are the warks o the flesh whilk are adultery lechery wantonness
6245,GAL,5,SCO1904,idolatry divination hatred fainoot jealousy wrath factions pairties
6246,GAL,5,SCO1904,envyins bludeshed druckenness revellins and siclike things as to whilk i tell ye plainly een as i hae tellt ye afore that they wha practeese sic things as thir sanna inherit gods kingdom
6247,GAL,5,SCO1904,but the frute o the spirit is love happiness peace langtholin canniness gudeness lealness
6248,GAL,5,SCO1904,meekness selfguidin again sic things as thir thar is nae law
6249,GAL,5,SCO1904,but they wha are o christ jesus hae crucifyt the flesh wi its desires and hankerins
6250,GAL,5,SCO1904,gin we leeve by the spirit by the spirit lat us een be airtit
6251,GAL,5,SCO1904,lat us no be seekin for vain glorie challengin ane anither envyin ane anither
6252,GAL,6,SCO1904,brethren gin aiblins a man be betrayt intil a faut ye wha are spiritual recover sic a ane i the spirit o canniness lookin to yersel least ye yersel be tempit
6253,GAL,6,SCO1904,uphaud ye ane anithers burdens sae sal ye perform the law o christ
6254,GAL,6,SCO1904,for gin a man thinks he is something whan he is naething he is but deceivin his sel in his ain mind
6255,GAL,6,SCO1904,but lat ilka man test his ain wark and than sal he hae pleasur in himsel allenarlie and no in what anither thinks
6256,GAL,6,SCO1904,for ilka man sal cairry his ain backburden
6257,GAL,6,SCO1904,nanetheless lat him that is instructit i the word hae
6258,GAL,6,SCO1904,fellowship wi him that instructs in a gude things
6259,GAL,6,SCO1904,dinna deceive yer sels god isna to be mocked for what a man saws the same sall he shear
6260,GAL,6,SCO1904,for he that saws till his ain flesh oot o the flesh sal hae corruption but he wha saws to the spirit oot o the spirit sal hae lifeforaye
6261,GAL,6,SCO1904,but in doin what is weel lat us no be cuistendoon for in due time we sal reap gin we gienaup
6262,GAL,6,SCO1904,sae than een as we hae openins lat us work what is gude toward a men special toward the hoosehauld o the faith
6263,GAL,6,SCO1904,see wi sic muckle letters i wrate tye wi my ain haun
6264,GAL,6,SCO1904,as monie as wad mak a bonnie schaw i the flesh they wad gar ye be circumceesed only that they soudna dree persecution for the cross o christ
6265,GAL,6,SCO1904,for no een they wha hae become circumceesed are their sels observin the law but they wad hae ye circumceesed that they micht boast theirsels in your flesh
6266,GAL,6,SCO1904,but wi me lat it be far frae boastin gin it bena in the cross o oor lord jesus christ throwe wham the warld to me is crucifyt and i to the warld
6267,GAL,6,SCO1904,for in christ jesus naither circumceesion is onything nor uncircumceesion but a new creation

7073,HEB,1,SCO1904,but at sic a time again as he soud send the firstbegotten into the warld he says and lat a the angels worship him
7074,HEB,1,SCO1904,and o the angels he says wha maks his angels be winds and his servitors flauchts o fire
7075,HEB,1,SCO1904,but anent the son thy thron o god is to a ages and the sceptre o thy kingdom is a sceptre o richtousness
7076,HEB,1,SCO1904,thou hast loed richtousness and scunnerd at ill and for this god has anointit thee wi the oyle o gladness aboon thy marrows
7077,HEB,1,SCO1904,and thou lord at the foreend did set the fundation o the yirth and the heevens are the warks o thy hauns

7080,HEB,1,SCO1904,but to whilk ane o the angels has he said at ony time sit thou at my richt haun till i mak thy faes the fitbrod o thy feet
7081,HEB,1,SCO1904,arena they a waitin spirits sent oot to wait on thae that sal inherit salvation
7082,HEB,2,SCO1904,and for the sake o a this we soud ettle sair to haud fast the things that war heard least at ony time we soud slype awa
7083,HEB,2,SCO1904,for gif the word spoken throwe angels was stieve and ilka ganginagley and disobedience gat its true recompense o reward
7084,HEB,2,SCO1904,hoo sal we scape gif we gie the gangby to sae great a salvation whilk in truth begude to be spoken throwe the lord by they wha heard and to us was made siccar

7090,HEB,2,SCO1904,thou did pit a things subject aneath his feet for in makin a things subject to him naething was left oot that wasna made subject to him whauras noo we seena yet a things to him made subject
7091,HEB,2,SCO1904,but the ane wha was made for a wee laigher nor the angels div we behauld een jesus crooned wi glorie and honor throwe the pangs o death that by the tenderlove o god he might pree o death for a men
7092,HEB,2,SCO1904,for it behoovd him for whase sake are a things and throwe wham are a things in leading mony sons to glorie that the chieftain o their salvation soud by sufferins be made perfete
7093,HEB,2,SCO1904,for baith he wha maks holie and they wha are made holie are a o ane for whilk cause he isna backward to ca them brethren
7094,HEB,2,SCO1904,sayin i wull mak kent thy name to my brethren amang a the thrang wull i sing praise to thee

7098,HEB,2,SCO1904,and micht deliver thir as mony as frae fear o death war a their life under bondage
7099,HEB,2,SCO1904,for no truly is he takin haud o angels but he lays haud o abrams seed
7100,HEB,2,SCO1904,and sae in a things he bude be made like his brethren that he micht be a mercifu and leal heighpriest in the things o god to mak a reconciliation for folks sins
7101,HEB,2,SCO1904,for seein he dreed his sel and was tempit he kens weel to rescue them that are in temptation
7102,HEB,3,SCO1904,sae holie brethren the biddenanes o a heevenlie biddin look weel at the apostle and heighpriest o oor profession jesus
7103,HEB,3,SCO1904,wha was leal to him wha made him priest as was moses in a his hoose
7104,HEB,3,SCO1904,for he is coontit wordie o mair glorie nor moses by as muckle as he wha biggs the hoose has mair glorie nor the hoose
7105,HEB,3,SCO1904,for ilka hoose is made by some ane but he wha made a things is god
7106,HEB,3,SCO1904,and indeed moses was leal in a his hoose as a steward for a witness o the things that war to be spoken
7107,HEB,3,SCO1904,but christ as a son ower his ain hoose whase hoose are we gin aiblins we haud siccar the freedom o the promise and the glorie o the hope to the end

7109,HEB,3,SCO1904,hardenyena yere hearts as in the bitter thrawartness on the day o temptation i the desert
7110,HEB,3,SCO1904,whan yere forbears tempit me wi a test and saw my warks forty year
7111,HEB,3,SCO1904,sae was i sair vexed wi this generation and said aye gang they agley i their heart and they divna ken my ways
7112,HEB,3,SCO1904,sae did i sweer i my wrath they sal enterna intil my rest
7113,HEB,3,SCO1904,tak ye tent brethren least at ony time thar soud be in ony o ye a dour heart o unbelief in fainawa frae the leevin god
7114,HEB,3,SCO1904,but exhort anetheither day by day een as lang as it is cad the day least ony o ye be hardened throwe the glamor o sin
7115,HEB,3,SCO1904,for gin we haud siccar tae the hinner end the beginnin o oor faith we hae come to be pairtners wi christ
7116,HEB,3,SCO1904,while it is said the day gin ye wull hear his voice hardenyena yere hearts as in the bitter thrawartness
7117,HEB,3,SCO1904,for wha wast tho they heard caused the bitterness na didna a thae wha cam oot o egypt by moses
7118,HEB,3,SCO1904,but wham was he sair vexed wi for forty year wast no wi thae that sinned wha fell i the desert
7119,HEB,3,SCO1904,and to wham swure he that they soudna enter intil his
7120,HEB,3,SCO1904,rest but to thae wha war thrawn and dour
7121,HEB,3,SCO1904,and we see they warna able to enter in for unbelief
7122,HEB,4,SCO1904,lat us than hae fear least at ony time tho thar be a promise left o enterin intil his rest ony frae mang ye soud come short ot
7123,HEB,4,SCO1904,for to us has the joyfumessage been gien een as to them but the word o their hearin did them nae gude they no makin their sels ane in faith wi thae that hearkent
7124,HEB,4,SCO1904,for we that hae had faith div enter intil the
7125,HEB,4,SCO1904,rest conform to what he has said as i did sweer i my wrath they sanna enter intil my rest tho the warks war a endit frae the fundation o the yirth
7126,HEB,4,SCO1904,for he has said in a place anent the seeventh day thus and god restit on the seeventh day frae a his warks
7127,HEB,4,SCO1904,and in this place again gif they sal enter intil my rest
7128,HEB,4,SCO1904,sae seein it is left ower for some to enter intilt and they wha afore had the joyfumessage delivert to them entertna in on accoont o thrawartness
7129,HEB,4,SCO1904,he still marks oot a certain day sayin by dauvid een eftir sae lang a time as that juist like as it had been said afore the day gin aiblins ye hear his voice makna hard yere hearts
7130,HEB,4,SCO1904,for gin joshua had gien rest to them he wadna i that case hae been speakin eftir thae things o anither day
7131,HEB,4,SCO1904,sae thar is bein left ower a sabbathkeepin for a the folk o god
7132,HEB,4,SCO1904,for he that entert intil his rest he eke has restit frae a his warks as god did frae his
7133,HEB,4,SCO1904,lat us than gie a tent to enter intil that rest least ony ane fas i the same example o thrawartness
7134,HEB,4,SCO1904,for gods word is leevin and michty keener nor a twaedged sword thringin throwe to the pairtin o saul and spirit o joints and marrow and gleg at discernin the airtins and ettlins o the heart
7135,HEB,4,SCO1904,and thar isna a creatit thing that can be hidden frae his sicht but a things are nakit and laid bare to the een o him wham we hae to do wi
7136,HEB,4,SCO1904,haein than a great heighpriest wha has gane up throwe the heevens jesus the son o god lat us haud siccar oor confession
7137,HEB,4,SCO1904,for we haena a heighpriest that hasna a britherfeelin wi oor weaknesses but ane wha was tempit in a the likeness o oorsels yet wantin sin
7138,HEB,4,SCO1904,lat us than draw nar wi freedom o speech to the thron o tenderlove that we may obteen mercie and find favor to help us in oor need
7139,HEB,5,SCO1904,for ilka heighpriest taen frae among men is appointit for things o god that he may offer baith gifts and sacrifeeces for sins
7140,HEB,5,SCO1904,as ane wha can marrow weel in his heart wi thae that are ignorant and gane aside sin he his sel is rinkit roon wi weakness
7141,HEB,5,SCO1904,and on this accoont he bude for his sel sae for the folk to be offerin for sins
7142,HEB,5,SCO1904,and nae man taks to him this honor but is cad by god een as aaron was
7143,HEB,5,SCO1904,and sae een christ magnifytna himsel to be made a heighpriest but raither it was he that spak to him sayin my son art thou this day hae i begotten thee
7144,HEB,5,SCO1904,een as in anither place he says thou a priest for aye i the order o melchizedek
7145,HEB,5,SCO1904,wha i the days o his flesh eftir offerin up prayers and entreaties to him wha was strang to save him frae death wi sair ootcries and tears and had been
7146,HEB,5,SCO1904,heard for his godly fear
7147,HEB,5,SCO1904,een tho he was a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he tholed
7148,HEB,5,SCO1904,and bein perfetit becam to a thae obeyin him the fundation o an endless salvation
7149,HEB,5,SCO1904,haein been addressed by god himsel as heighpriest i the order o melchizedek
7150,HEB,5,SCO1904,anent wham we hae muckle to say and are sair beset hoo to say it seein ye are become feckless in hearin
7151,HEB,5,SCO1904,for een whan ye soud hae come to be teachers i the lapse o time ye hae need ance mair that ane be teachin you the vera elements o the first principles o the oracles o god and are gotten to be sic as hae need o milk and no o mans meat
7152,HEB,5,SCO1904,for ilka ane takin milk wants skill i the word o richtousness for he is a wean
7153,HEB,5,SCO1904,but tae sic as are mangrown pertains mans meat to thae wha throwe proper use hae their pooers exerceest to discern baith gude and ill
7154,HEB,6,SCO1904,tharfor lat us lea thir beginnins o the things o christ and gang on toward fu growth no layin ower again the fundation o turning frae deid warks and o faith toward god
7155,HEB,6,SCO1904,o the teachin anent bapteezins and o layinon o hauns and o the risin fraethedeid and o eternal judgment
7156,HEB,6,SCO1904,and this wull we do gin at least god permit
7157,HEB,6,SCO1904,for it isna possible as to thae wha ance had licht and had preed the freegift o heeven and had been made to partak o the holie spirit
7158,HEB,6,SCO1904,and had preed the sweet word o god and the pooers o the warld to come
7159,HEB,6,SCO1904,and then fain awa ance mair to newform them until repentance seein they are crucifyin ower again to their sels the son o god and makin a public shame o him
7160,HEB,6,SCO1904,for the grund that sooks in the aftfain rain and brings forth what they wad fain hae wha till it receives blessin frae god
7161,HEB,6,SCO1904,but gin it bear thorns and briers it is no esteemed and is narhaun bein curst whase end is to be brunt
7162,HEB,6,SCO1904,but we are perswadit better things o you beloved een things o salvation tho we div sae speak
7163,HEB,6,SCO1904,for god is no illdeedie to be forgettin yere wark and love that ye schawed forth for his name in serin the saunts and still serin
7164,HEB,6,SCO1904,but we hae mickle desire that ilk ane o ye schaw forth the same perseverin to the fu confidence o hope een tae the end
7165,HEB,6,SCO1904,that ye bena slack but followin on eftir thae wha by faith and longtholin fell heirs to the promises
7166,HEB,6,SCO1904,for whan god made promise to abram seein thar war nane greater to sweer by he swure by his sel
7167,HEB,6,SCO1904,sayin certes in blessin wull i bless thee and in multiplyin wull i multiply thee
7168,HEB,6,SCO1904,and sae tholin patiently he gat the promise
7169,HEB,6,SCO1904,for men sweer by ane greater and wi them an aith is the end o a disputin
7170,HEB,6,SCO1904,and sae god bein muckle mair willin to schaw forth to the heirs o the promise the siccarness o his coonsel cam in wi an aith
7171,HEB,6,SCO1904,for by
7172,HEB,6,SCO1904,twa unchangeable things in whilk it wasna possible for god to be fause a stieve consolation we soud hae wha fled to grip the hope set afore us
7173,HEB,6,SCO1904,whilk hope we hae as an anchor o the saul baith siccar and sure and comin ben within the veil
7174,HEB,6,SCO1904,whaur jesus as forerinner for us has entert wha was made a heighpriest for aye i the order o melchizedek
7175,HEB,7,SCO1904,for this melchizedek king o salem priest o god maist heigh that forgathert wi abram as he cam back frae the slauchtir o the kings and blesst him
7176,HEB,7,SCO1904,till wham gied abram een a tenth o a he bein first by translation king o richtousness and than as weel king o salem whilk is king o peace
7177,HEB,7,SCO1904,wantin faither wantin mither withoot pedigree haein naither beginnin o days nor end o life but made to be like the son o god bides a priest withoot interruption
7178,HEB,7,SCO1904,and noo think hoo great this man is till wham abram gied a tenth oot o the best spoil een abram the patriarch
7179,HEB,7,SCO1904,and they truly frae amang levis sons wha are gien the priesthood hae instructions to tak tithes o the folk conform to the law that is o their brethren een tho they hae come oot o the loins o abram
7180,HEB,7,SCO1904,but he wha winsna his pedigree frae them gat tithes frae abram and blesst him wha had the promises
7181,HEB,7,SCO1904,but aboon a disputin the heigher aye blesses the laigher
7182,HEB,7,SCO1904,and here truly men wha dee tak tithes but thar ane taks them wha obteens witness that he leeves
7183,HEB,7,SCO1904,and sae to speak een levi wha taks tithes pays tithes throwe abram
7184,HEB,7,SCO1904,for yet i the loins o his faither was he whan melchizedek forgathert wi him
7185,HEB,7,SCO1904,noo truly than gin thar war a perfetin throwe the levitical priesthood for neath it the folk had the law gien them whatna need wus thar for a different priest to be raised up conform to the order o melchizedek and no be named as conform to the order of aaron
7186,HEB,7,SCO1904,for seein thar is a change o priesthood thar maun een as weel be a change o law
7187,HEB,7,SCO1904,for he o wham thir things are said has pairt wi a different tribe frae whilk nae man has gien attendance at the altar
7188,HEB,7,SCO1904,for the truth is siccar that oot o judah sprang oor lord anent whilk tribe moses spak naething aboot priests
7189,HEB,7,SCO1904,and still muckle mair is it evident that conform to the likeness o melchizedek is to be raised up a different priest
7190,HEB,7,SCO1904,wha has been made a priest no conform to the rule o a commandment dealin wi flesh but conform to the pooer o a life for aye
7191,HEB,7,SCO1904,for it is witnessed thou art a priest for aye o the order o melchizedek
7192,HEB,7,SCO1904,for truly a settinaside o a foregaun commandment comes aboot on account o its weakness and want o profit
7193,HEB,7,SCO1904,for the law brocht naething to perfection but thar is the cominin o a better hope throwe whilk we draw nar to god
7194,HEB,7,SCO1904,and inasmuckle as it wasna wantin an aithtakin
7195,HEB,7,SCO1904,for thae priests war made wantin an aith whauras he wi an aithtakin by him that said to him the lord swure and gangsna back thou art a priest for aye o the order o melchizedek
7196,HEB,7,SCO1904,by sae muckle as this has jesus come to be
7197,HEB,7,SCO1904,cation o a heigher covenant
7198,HEB,7,SCO1904,and truly in lairger numbers hae they been made priests for that on accoont o death they coudna bide
7199,HEB,7,SCO1904,but he in that he bides for aye everconstant hauds the priesthood
7200,HEB,7,SCO1904,sae is he able to sauf to a extremitie thae that come throwe him to god leevin aye to intercede in their behauf
7201,HEB,7,SCO1904,for siccan a heighpriest as this for us was aye meet wha was holie innocent uncorrupt sindry frae sinners and made to be aboon the heevens
7202,HEB,7,SCO1904,wha has nae need day by day to be offerin up sacrifeeces like thae heighpriests for his ain sins and than for thae o the folk for this he did ance for a whan his ain sel he offert
7203,HEB,7,SCO1904,for the law appointit men heighpriests haein weakness but the word o the aithtakin whilk was eftir the law appoints the son wha is consecrate for evermair
7204,HEB,8,SCO1904,but as bringing to a point what we hae said siccan a heighpriest hae we as this wha is set on the richt haun o the thron o the majestie i the heevens
7205,HEB,8,SCO1904,o the holie place and o the true tabernacle whilk the lord pitched and no a man
7206,HEB,8,SCO1904,for ilka heighpriest is ordeened for the offerin o baith gifts and sacrifeeces and it was necessar for this ane too that he soud hae that whilk he micht offer
7207,HEB,8,SCO1904,gin than the lord had been on yirth he hadna been a priest ava sin thar are thae offering the gifts conform to the law
7208,HEB,8,SCO1904,wha een as a glint and shadow o heevenlie things are doin service een as moses had word whan aboot to finish the tabernacle for tak tent says he that ye mak a things conform to the paittern schawn to ye i the mount
7209,HEB,8,SCO1904,but noo has he obteened a mair noble ministry by as muckle as he is the mediator o a
7210,HEB,8,SCO1904,heigher covenant whilk is established on heigher promises
7211,HEB,8,SCO1904,for gin the first had been perfete nae need wad thar hae been for a second
7212,HEB,8,SCO1904,for as wytin them he says tak tent the days come says the lord that i wull mak wi the hoose o isral and the hoose o judah a new covenant
7213,HEB,8,SCO1904,no conform to the covenant i made wi their forbears i the day i took them by the haun to lead them oot o the land o egypt for it was that they badena i my covenant and i disregairdit them says the lord
7214,HEB,8,SCO1904,but this is the covenant i wull covenant wi israls hoose eftir thae days says the lord i wull pit my laws i their minds and write them on their hearts and i wull be to them for a god and they sal be for me a folk
7215,HEB,8,SCO1904,and nae need ilk ane to teach his marrow or ilk ane his brither sayin ken ye the lord for a they sal ken me frae the smaest to the greatest o them
7216,HEB,8,SCO1904,for i wull be mercifu to their unrichtousness and o their sins will i be mindfu nae mair
7217,HEB,8,SCO1904,by this word a new covenant he made the first ane auld but what is made past use and auld is passin awa
7218,HEB,9,SCO1904,and eke the first covenant had its ordinances o divine service and a sanctuary o this present warld
7219,HEB,9,SCO1904,for a tabernacle was plenisht the first in whilk war baith the lampstead and the table and the settinforth o the breid whilk is cad the holie
7220,HEB,9,SCO1904,but eftir the second veil the tabernacle cad the holie o holies
7221,HEB,9,SCO1904,haein a gowden censer and the ark o the covenant owerlaid wi gowd in whilk was a gowden pat haudin the manna and aarons wand that bloomed and the tables o the covenant
7222,HEB,9,SCO1904,but ower aboon it the cherubim o glorie owershadin the mercyseat anent whilk things it isna necessar enoo to speak specially
7223,HEB,9,SCO1904,noo when thir things war sae ordeened intil the first tabernacle gaed aye continually the priests makin the services
7224,HEB,9,SCO1904,but intil the second the heighpriest alane ance ilka year and no wantin blude whilk he offers for his sel and for the blinness o the folk
7225,HEB,9,SCO1904,the holie spirit sae makin it seen that the gate to the holiest hadna yet been made plain whiles the first tabernacle was staunin
7226,HEB,9,SCO1904,whilk indeed was a likeness for the time noo come conform to whilk was offert baith gifts and offerans that canna as to the conscience mak him perfete wha offers the service
7227,HEB,9,SCO1904,bein but eatin and drinkin and a hantle o purifications appointit to a time o mair licht
7228,HEB,9,SCO1904,but whan christ drew nar a heighpriest o comin gude things throwe the better and mair perfete tabernacle no made wi hauns that is no o this creation
7229,HEB,9,SCO1904,nor yet throwe blude o goats and cauves but throwe his ain blude he entert in ance for a to the holie place haein won eternal redemption
7230,HEB,9,SCO1904,for gin the blude o goats and bulls and the assis o a quey strinklin the defild sanctifies to the pureness o the flesh
7231,HEB,9,SCO1904,hoo muckle mair sal the blude o christ wha throwe the everleevin spirit offert his sel wantin blemish until god purify yere conscience frae deid warks to the offerin up o a divine service to the leevin god
7232,HEB,9,SCO1904,and for sic a reason is he the mediator o a new covenant to the end that a death haein taen place for the redeemin o sins aneath the first covenant thae that hae been invitit may receive the promise o eternal inheritance
7233,HEB,9,SCO1904,for whaur a covenant is it is necessar that a death soud come in on his side wha covenants
7234,HEB,9,SCO1904,for a covenant is made siccar eftir a death but it is o nae effeck while the
7235,HEB,9,SCO1904,covenanter leeves
7236,HEB,9,SCO1904,and sae no een the first covenant was consecrate wantin blude
7237,HEB,9,SCO1904,for whan a the commauns war spoken conform tae the law by moses to the folk takin the blude o the cauves and the goats wi watir and scarlet oo and hyssop he strinklt baith the buik and a the folk
7238,HEB,9,SCO1904,sayin this is the blude o the covenant whilk god sent in commaun to you
7239,HEB,9,SCO1904,aye and the tabernacle as weel and a the veschels o the service strinklt he in like mainner wi the blude
7240,HEB,9,SCO1904,and narhaun a things are purifyt wi blude conform to the law and wantin the bludesheddin is nae remission
7241,HEB,9,SCO1904,it was a necessity than for the imitations o things in heeven to be purifyt wi sic but the heevenlie things theirsels wi better sacrifeeces than thir
7242,HEB,9,SCO1904,for no intil holies madewihauns did christ gang in that war but figures o the true holies but intil heeven itsel noo to come plainly afore the face o god for us
7243,HEB,9,SCO1904,nor yet that afttimes soud he be offerin his sel like as the heighpriest enters the holieplace year by year wi ithers blude
7244,HEB,9,SCO1904,else had it been needfu for him aften to suffer frae the beginnin a the warld but noo ance at the end o the time has he been schawn for the settinby o sin throwe his sacrifeece
7245,HEB,9,SCO1904,and inasmuckle as it is laid up for men ance to dee and eftir this the judgment
7246,HEB,9,SCO1904,sae christ haein ance for a been offert and carryt the sin o mony sal appear a second time apairt frae sin to thae that fain wait for him for their salvation
7247,HEB,10,SCO1904,for the law wi a shadow o the gude things to come and no the perfete likeness o the things their sels canna wi thae sacrifeeces offert up year by year aye mak perfete them that draw nar
7248,HEB,10,SCO1904,for than wadna they quat bein offert for they worshippin bein
7249,HEB,10,SCO1904,ance for a purifyt wad hae nae mair conscience o sins
7250,HEB,10,SCO1904,but in them is a bringinback to mind o sins year by year
7251,HEB,10,SCO1904,impossible ist for blude o bulls and goats to tak awa sins
7252,HEB,10,SCO1904,whaurfor comin intil the warld he says sacrifeece and offeran thou willestna but a body didst thou prepare for me
7253,HEB,10,SCO1904,in hail bruntofferans and offerans for sins thou didstna joy
7254,HEB,10,SCO1904,than said i behauld i am come at the heid o the buik it is written o me to do thy wull o god
7255,HEB,10,SCO1904,aboon sayin sacrifeeces and offerans and haill bruntofferans and offerans for sin thou willestna naither didst joy in sic as conform to the law are offert
7256,HEB,10,SCO1904,than did he say behauld i am come to do thy wull he taks awa the first that he may mak siccar the second
7257,HEB,10,SCO1904,by the whilk wull we are made holie throwe the offerin o the body o jesus christ ance for a
7258,HEB,10,SCO1904,and ilka priest stauns in truth day eftir day servin and offerin ower again the same sacrifeeces whilk truly can never tak awa sins
7259,HEB,10,SCO1904,but he haein offert ae sacrifeece for sins for evermair sut doon at gods richt haun
7260,HEB,10,SCO1904,frae this waitin till his faes be made the fitbrod o his feet
7261,HEB,10,SCO1904,for by the aeofferan he has perfetit for evermair them that are sanctifyt
7262,HEB,10,SCO1904,and the holie spirit himsel bears witness for us for eftir he had said
7263,HEB,10,SCO1904,this is the covenant i wull covenant wi them eftir thae days says jehovah giean my laws on their hearts i wull write them on their minds
7264,HEB,10,SCO1904,he says mair their sins and their illdeediness wull i naewise mind ony mair
7265,HEB,10,SCO1904,noo whaursaeer they are remittit thar is nae mair offeran for sin needfu
7266,HEB,10,SCO1904,haein than brethren bauldness o speech to enter intil the holiest by the blude o jesus
7267,HEB,10,SCO1904,whilk enterinin he has consecrate for us a new way and a way o life throwe the veil that is his flesh
7268,HEB,10,SCO1904,and haein sic a great heighpriest ower the hoosehauld o god
7269,HEB,10,SCO1904,lat us come nar wi leal hearts in the fu confidence o faith haein been strinklt in oor hearts frae an ill conscience and haein been wesht in oor bodies wi pure watir
7270,HEB,10,SCO1904,lat us haud siccar the confession o oor hope wi nae wafflin for leal is he that did undertak
7271,HEB,10,SCO1904,and lat us think upo aneanither for an encouragin to love and gude warks
7272,HEB,10,SCO1904,no lattinfa the forgatherin o oorsels een as it is the way wi some but perswadin aye and sae muckle the mair as ye see the dawin o the day
7273,HEB,10,SCO1904,for gif we gang on sinnin eftir receivin the knowledge o the truth nae langer for sin is thar remainin a sacrifeece
7274,HEB,10,SCO1904,but a fearsome lookinforrit tae judgment and a sautness o fire that sal devoor the enemy
7275,HEB,10,SCO1904,ane that set aside moses law deet withoot pitie afore twa or thrie witnesses
7276,HEB,10,SCO1904,o hoo muckle sairer punishment think ye sal he be hauden wordie wha trampit the son o god under fit and held as an unclean thing the blude o the covenant by whilk he is consecrate and did wantonly misca the spirit o love
7277,HEB,10,SCO1904,for we ken wha said to me perteens avenging i wull recompense and again jehovah wull judge his folk
7278,HEB,10,SCO1904,it is a fearsome thing to fa intil the hauns o a leevin god
7279,HEB,10,SCO1904,but mindyena the days gane by in whilk ance ye gat licht ye tholed an unco fecht o sufferans
7280,HEB,10,SCO1904,some pairt that ye war made wi miscain and griefs a ferlie for men and some pairt that ye war made marrows o thae that war sae dune till
7281,HEB,10,SCO1904,for ye took the pairt o thae in bonds and tholed the poindin o yere gear wi joy kennin that ye hae for yersels better and everbidin gear
7282,HEB,10,SCO1904,ye maunna cast awa than yere bauldness o speech whilk in truth has unco reward
7283,HEB,10,SCO1904,for ye hae need o patience that haein dune gods wull ye may win the promise
7284,HEB,10,SCO1904,for yet a wee while fleetin fleetin the comin ane sal come and no delay
7285,HEB,10,SCO1904,but the richtous ane by faith sal leeve but gin ye gang back my saul delichtsna in him
7286,HEB,10,SCO1904,but we arena o them wha gang back to perdition but o faith to the salvation o the saul
7287,HEB,11,SCO1904,noo faith is gruppin the substance o things lookit for the confidence o raalthings no yet seen

7289,HEB,11,SCO1904,throwe faith we come to ken the warlds war ordert by the words of god sae as that whilk is seen was made oot o what was seenna
